Given the initial state, we have the following information:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, but their exact values are not relevant for the print statement.
- The print statement is `print('PEAK')`.

The print statement simply outputs the string 'PEAK', and it does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **PEAK**
