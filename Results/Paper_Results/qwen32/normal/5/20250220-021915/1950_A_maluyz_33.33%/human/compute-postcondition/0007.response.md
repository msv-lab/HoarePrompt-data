The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NONE'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, and it is specified that `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to `c`.

Since the `print` statement is `print('NONE')`, it will output the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **NONE**
