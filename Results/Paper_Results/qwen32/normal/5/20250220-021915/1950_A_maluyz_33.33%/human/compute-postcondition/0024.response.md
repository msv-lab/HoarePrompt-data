Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 1, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. If `a < b < c`, the program executes the if part; otherwise, it executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as specified in the precondition.**
