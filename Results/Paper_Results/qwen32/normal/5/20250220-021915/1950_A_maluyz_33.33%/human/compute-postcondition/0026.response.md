The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This means the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated based on the input, while the values of `t`, `i`, and the condition `a < b < c` will remain as specified in the precondition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input.**

In simpler terms, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input. The condition `a < b < c` is still relevant for the subsequent logic in the program.
