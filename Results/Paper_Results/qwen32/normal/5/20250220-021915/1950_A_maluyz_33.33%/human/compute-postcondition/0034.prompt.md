Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if a < b < c:
        print('STAIR')
    elif a == b == c:
        print('NONE')
    elif max(a, b, c) == b:
        print('PEAK')
    else:
        print('NONE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. If `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`, then `a < b < c`. Otherwise, if `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to `c`, then `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal. In all other cases, it is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, and the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is not `b` if `b` is not the largest.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 1, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. If `a < b < c`, the program executes the if part; otherwise, it executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as specified in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 2, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. If `a` < `b` < `c`, no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. If `a` equals `b` equals `c`, no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
