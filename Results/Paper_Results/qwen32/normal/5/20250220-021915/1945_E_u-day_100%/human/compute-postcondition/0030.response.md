In the provided `while` loop, the loop condition is `low + 1 < high`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the difference between `high` and `low` must be at least 2.

Let's analyze the provided state and see which variables need to be adjusted:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`.
- `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found.
- `st` is a set containing `n // 2` and `mid`.
- `mid` is `n // 2`.
- If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is set to `n // 2`. Otherwise, `high` is set to `n // 2`.

From the loop condition `low + 1 < high`, we need to ensure that `low` and `high` are adjusted such that their difference is at least 2. Given that `mid` is `n // 2`, we can infer that `low` and `high` should be set to values around `mid` to ensure the loop can execute again.

To make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `low` and `high` such that `low + 1 < high`. Since `mid` is `n // 2`, we can set `low` to `mid - 1` and `high` to `mid + 1` (assuming `mid` is not at the boundaries). However, since `low` and `high` are not defined in the initial state, we need to ensure that they are set in a way that satisfies the loop condition.

Given the initial state, we can assume that `low` and `high` are set to values that allow the loop to execute. Since `mid` is `n // 2`, we can set `low` to `mid - 1` and `high` to `mid + 1` to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `st` is a set containing `n // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `low` is `mid - 1`, `high` is `mid + 1`**
