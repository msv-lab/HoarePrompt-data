Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of visited midpoints during the binary search. If the current element at index `i` in `arr` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**
