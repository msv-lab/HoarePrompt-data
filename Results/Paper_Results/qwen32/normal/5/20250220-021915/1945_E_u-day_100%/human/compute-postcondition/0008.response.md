The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `pos`. Therefore, the value of `pos` is now equal to `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of visited midpoints during the binary search. `pos` is set to `i`.**
