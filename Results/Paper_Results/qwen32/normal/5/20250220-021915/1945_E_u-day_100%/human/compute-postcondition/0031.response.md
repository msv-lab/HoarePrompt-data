The code updates the value of `mid` based on the current values of `low` and `high`. Given that `low` is `mid - 1` and `high` is `mid + 1`, the new value of `mid` will be the average of `low` and `high`, which simplifies to the original value of `mid`.

Here's the calculation:
- `mid = (low + high) // 2`
- `mid = ((mid - 1) + (mid + 1)) // 2`
- `mid = (2 * mid) // 2`
- `mid = mid`

Thus, the value of `mid` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `st` is a set containing `n // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `low` is `mid - 1`, `high` is `mid + 1`**.
