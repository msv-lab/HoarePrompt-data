The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at a certain value (let's call it `i_current`), and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Since the specific value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not provided, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `i_current` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `i_current + 1` at the start of the next iteration. The condition `n > i` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of visited midpoints during the binary search. If the current element at index `i` in `arr` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1**.
