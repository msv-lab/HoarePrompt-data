The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The values of `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, only `n` does.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `i` is not specified in the loop head and is automatically managed by the `range` function, so we do not need to adjust it.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `k`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of visited midpoints during the binary search.**
