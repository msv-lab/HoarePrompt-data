The code snippet calculates the midpoint between `low` and `high` and assigns it to the variable `mid`. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `n`, `mid` will be `(0 + n) // 2`, which simplifies to `n // 2`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`) remain unchanged by this calculation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set, `mid` is `n // 2`**.
