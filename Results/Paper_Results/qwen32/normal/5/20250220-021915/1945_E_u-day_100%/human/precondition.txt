Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the length of the permutation, and an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ n) representing the number to be found. The following line contains a permutation p of n distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
