The code snippet `arr = func_2()` updates the value of `arr` to whatever `func_2()` returns. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, `st`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `n`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `k`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is an integer representing the index of `k` in `arr`, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of visited midpoints during the binary search.**
