Reasoning: 

The provided program, which consists of three functions, attempts to solve the problem by performing a binary search on a permutation to find a specific number `x`. However, the program does not fully meet the problem's requirements.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the functions and their behavior:

1. **func_1**: This function reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, and converts each substring to an integer. It returns these integers as a map object. This function is correctly implemented for reading input values.

2. **func_2**: This function calls `func_1` and converts the returned map object to a list. This function is also correctly implemented.

3. **func_3**: This function performs the main logic of the problem. It reads the size of the permutation `n` and the number `k` to be found. It then reads the permutation `arr` and tries to locate the position of `k` in the array. It performs a binary search on the array to find `k` or the position where `k` should be if it were in the array.

   The function checks if `k` is found at the `low` index after the binary search. If `k` is found, it prints `0` (no swaps needed). If `k` is not found, it prints `1` and the indices of the elements to be swapped. The indices are the 1-based index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `k` and the 1-based index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`.

However, the problem requires that after performing up to two swaps, the binary search should correctly identify `k` at the `l` index. The current implementation does not ensure that `k` will be found at the `l` index after performing at most two swaps. It only performs one swap and does not handle the case where two swaps are necessary to meet the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program does not fully meet the problem's requirements and is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
