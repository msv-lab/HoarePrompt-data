Functionality: **The function performs a binary search on a list `arr` to find an integer `k`. It prints `0` if `k` is found in the list, otherwise it prints `1` and the 1-based index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `k`, followed by the 1-based index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `0` if `k` is not found.**
