To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and converges.

The loop is a binary search algorithm that narrows down the possible positions of `k` in the sorted list `arr`. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown of the loop:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `low` starts at 0.
   - `high` starts at `n`.
   - `st` is an empty set.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `low + 1 < high`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
   - `mid` is added to the set `st`.
   - If `arr[mid] > k`, `high` is set to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid`.

The loop will terminate when `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`, meaning `low` and `high` will be adjacent indices. At this point, `low` will be the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` and `high` will be the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`.

### Final Output State

- **`low` and `high`:** These will be adjacent indices, and `low` will point to the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`.
- **`st`:** This set will contain all the `mid` values that were checked during the binary search.
- **`pos`:** This variable remains unchanged throughout the loop and is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found.
- **`n` and `k`:** These remain the same as they are inputs to the functions `func_1()` and `func_2()` and are not modified within the loop.
- **`arr`:** This list remains unchanged as it is the output of `func_2()`.

### Conclusion

After all iterations of the loop, the output state will be:

- `low` and `high` will be adjacent indices, with `low` being the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`.
- `st` will contain all the `mid` values that were checked during the binary search.
- `pos`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` will remain unchanged.

Given the nature of the binary search, the final values of `low` and `high` will be such that `low` points to the largest index where `arr[low] <= k` and `high` points to the smallest index where `arr[high] > k`.

Output State: **`low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the `mid` values checked during the binary search, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`.**
