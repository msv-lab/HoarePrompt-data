Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `n`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `k`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, and `st` is a set used to keep track of visited midpoints during the binary search.**

In this output state, the variables `low` and `high` have been updated to 0 and `n`, respectively. All other variables retain their original values as described in the initial state.
