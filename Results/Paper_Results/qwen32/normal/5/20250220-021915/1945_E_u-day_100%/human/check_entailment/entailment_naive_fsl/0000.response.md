Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not always correctly rearrange the permutation to ensure that after performing the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. Specifically, the program only considers one swap if the initial binary search does not find `x` at `p_l`. However, the problem guarantees that up to two swaps are sufficient to achieve the goal, and the program does not explore the possibility of using two swaps.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
5 4 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1 3
2 3
```
or any other valid sequence of swaps that results in the permutation being rearranged such that after binary search, `p_l` is equal to `3`.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1
1 3
```
After one swap, the permutation becomes `[3, 4, 5, 2, 1]`. Performing binary search on this permutation will not result in `p_l` being equal to `3`.

The program needs to consider the possibility of making a second swap if the first swap does not result in the desired outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
