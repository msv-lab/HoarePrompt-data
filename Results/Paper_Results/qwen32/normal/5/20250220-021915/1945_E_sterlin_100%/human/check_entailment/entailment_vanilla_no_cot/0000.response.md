To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze whether the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

The provided code snippet only defines input functions and does not include the actual logic to solve the problem. It does not perform any operations on the permutation or implement the binary search algorithm as described. Therefore, it is clear that the program is incomplete and cannot be considered correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
