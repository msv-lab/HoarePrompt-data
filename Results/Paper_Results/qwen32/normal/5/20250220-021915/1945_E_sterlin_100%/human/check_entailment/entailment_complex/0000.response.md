### Reasoning:

1. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** Reads the number of test cases. This function is correct as it reads an integer from the input.
   - **func_2:** Reads the next line of input, which contains two integers (n and x). This function is correct as it reads and returns a map object of integers.
   - **func_3:** Reads the next line of input, which contains the permutation list. This function is correct as it reads and returns a list of integers.
   - **func_4:** Reads a line of input and returns it as a string. This function is correct but not used in the given code.
   - **func_5:** Reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. This function is correct but not used in the given code.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The algorithm performs a binary search on the permutation list `p` to find the number `x`.
   - The binary search is performed on the list `p` with the initial `left` set to 0 and `right` set to `n`.
   - If `p[left]` equals `x` after the binary search, no swaps are needed, and the function prints `0`.
   - If `x` is not seen during the binary search, it means `x` is not in the range considered by the binary search, and the function performs one swap to bring `x` into the correct position.
   - If `x` is seen but not at the correct position, the function performs two swaps to ensure `x` is at the correct position after the binary search.

3. **Logic Verification:**
   - The binary search logic is correctly implemented.
   - The swap logic ensures that `x` is positioned correctly after the binary search, with a maximum of two swaps as required.
   - The `seen` list is used to track which elements have been considered during the binary search, which helps in determining the necessary swaps.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to rearrange the permutation list `p` using a maximum of two swaps so that the binary search can find the number `x`. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are correctly implemented and used in the program.

**Correctness: True**
