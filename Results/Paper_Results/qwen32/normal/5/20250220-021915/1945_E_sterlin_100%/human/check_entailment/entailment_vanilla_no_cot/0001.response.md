To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described. The program provided appears to be incomplete because it only contains input reading functions and does not contain any logic for solving the problem.

The problem requires rearranging the permutation with at most two swaps so that after performing a binary search, the element at position `l` (which should be the position where `x` is found) is equal to `x`. The binary search algorithm is also provided in the problem statement.

Let's break down the logical steps required to solve this problem:

1. **Identify the position of `x` in the permutation**: First, find out where `x` is located in the permutation. This is necessary because the goal is to make `p_l = x` after the binary search.

2. **Simulate the binary search**: Understand how the binary search will behave on the permutation. The binary search will narrow down the search space by comparing the middle element with `x` and adjusting the search boundaries (`l` and `r`).

3. **Determine necessary swaps**: Based on the behavior of the binary search, determine if and how many swaps are needed to ensure that `p_l = x` at the end of the binary search. The problem guarantees that at most two swaps are sufficient.

4. **Output the swaps**: After determining the necessary swaps, output the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped.

The provided code does not include any of this logic. It only reads the input but does not process it or output any results. Therefore, the program is incomplete and incorrect based on the problem requirements.

**Correctness: False**
