Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user input, and `count` is the number of '1's in `a`. Additionally, `count` is greater than 0. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the conditions remain as specified in the if part. Otherwise, `count` is either less than or equal to 2 or odd. If `count` is equal to 2, the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is either not immediately followed by another '1' or is at the last position of the string. Otherwise, `count` is odd.**
