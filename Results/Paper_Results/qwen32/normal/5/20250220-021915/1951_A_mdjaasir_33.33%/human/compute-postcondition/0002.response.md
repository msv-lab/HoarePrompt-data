`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `start` and `end` remain non-negative integers such that `start <= end`, and `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start <= end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**
