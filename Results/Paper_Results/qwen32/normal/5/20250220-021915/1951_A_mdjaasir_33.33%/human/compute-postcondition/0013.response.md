The task involves understanding the initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine the output of the `print` statement. Let's break down the given information and analyze the code.

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start <= end`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is the value of the user input.
- `count` is the number of '1's in `a`.
- `count` is explicitly given as 2.
- The first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not immediately followed by another '1'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward. It prints the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `count`. The conditions and values provided in the initial state do not affect the content of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
