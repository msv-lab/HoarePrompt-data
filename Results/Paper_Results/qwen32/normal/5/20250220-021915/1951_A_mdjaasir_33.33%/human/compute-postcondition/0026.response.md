The `print('YES')` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `count`, or `i`. The statement will simply print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print('YES')` statement is a direct print command.
2. It does not reference any of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `count`, or `i`.
3. Therefore, the value of the string to be printed is explicitly 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
