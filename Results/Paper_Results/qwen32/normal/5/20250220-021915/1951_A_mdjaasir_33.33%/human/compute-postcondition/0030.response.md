Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user input, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The condition checks if the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not followed by another '1'. Regardless of whether the condition is true or false, the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `count`, and `i` maintain their described properties.**

This postcondition summarizes that the variables retain their properties and `i` is incremented by 1, irrespective of the outcome of the if condition.
