Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user input, and `count` is the number of '1's in `a`. Additionally, `count` is greater than 0, and `count` is not equal to 2. Furthermore, either `count` is less than or equal to 2 or `count` is odd, which implies that `count` must be odd since it cannot be equal to 2.**
