The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The values of `i` and `t` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `i` remains incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` remains greater than 0.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**
