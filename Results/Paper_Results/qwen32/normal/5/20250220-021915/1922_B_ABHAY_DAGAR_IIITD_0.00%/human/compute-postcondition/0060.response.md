Output State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the next element in `num_list`, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**

In natural language: The count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values, except `num_of_lens[x]` which has been updated.
