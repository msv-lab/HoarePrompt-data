The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. If there are more values in `num_of_lens` to iterate over, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` was the last value obtained from `num_of_lens.values()`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another key-value pair in `num_of_lens` that has not yet been iterated over. The next `cnt` will be the next value in the dictionary.

Since we don't have specific information about the remaining values in `num_of_lens`, we can assume that there is another value to iterate over, and we'll denote this new value as `next_cnt`.

State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it, where `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains 0. `test_cases` is decremented by 1. `n` is an input integer. `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer. `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`. `cnt` is `next_cnt`**
