The code snippet increments `total_count` by the value of `cnt`. The values of other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Since the code only modifies `total_count`, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`.**
