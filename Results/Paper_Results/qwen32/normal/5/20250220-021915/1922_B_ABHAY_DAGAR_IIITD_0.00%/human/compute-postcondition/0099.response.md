The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. 

If `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1. If `x` is not a key in `num_of_lens`, it will be added to the dictionary with the value 1.

Given the initial state, the values of `results`, `res`, `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, and the specific `x` from `num_list` remain unchanged except for `num_of_lens`.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it, `res` holds its original value, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `x` is incremented by 1.**
