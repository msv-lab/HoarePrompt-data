Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it; `res` holds its original value; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` takes an input from the user and `int()` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`results`, `res`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions, but `test_cases` has been decremented by 1 as per the initial state description.
