To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables `res`, `total_count`, and `results` evolve over the iterations.

The loop iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`, which is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`. For each value `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, the loop updates `res` based on the conditions given, and increments `total_count` by `cnt`. After processing all values, `res` is appended to `results`, and `test_cases` is decremented by 1.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `res` starts at 0.
   - `total_count` starts at 0.
   - `results` starts as an empty list.
   - `test_cases` is decremented by 1 after the loop completes.

2. **Loop Iterations**:
   - For each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`:
     - If `cnt >= 3`, add `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to `res`.
     - If `cnt >= 2`, add `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to `res`.
     - Add `cnt` to `total_count`.

3. **Post-Loop**:
   - Append the final value of `res` to `results`.
   - Decrement `test_cases` by 1.

The final value of `res` is the sum of all contributions from each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions specified in the loop.

**Output State**: **`results` is a list with the final `res` appended to it; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`; `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens.values()`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `results` will contain the final computed value of `res` which is the sum of all combinations of triples and pairs from `num_of_lens` weighted by `total_count`. `test_cases` will be one less than its initial value, and all other variables remain as they were defined initially except for `total_count` which accumulates the counts of all unique integers in `num_list`.
