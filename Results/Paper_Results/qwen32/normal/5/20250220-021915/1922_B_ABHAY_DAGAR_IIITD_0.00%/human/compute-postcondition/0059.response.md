The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `num_list`. If `num_list` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the next element in `num_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_list` must have at least one more element, and `x` will be the next element in `num_list`.

Given that `num_list` must have at least 1 integer and `x` is the next element in `num_list`, we need to adjust `x` to be the next element in `num_list` for the next iteration.

State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the next element in `num_list`. If `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, its count is incremented by 1; otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a count of 1. `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, and `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**
