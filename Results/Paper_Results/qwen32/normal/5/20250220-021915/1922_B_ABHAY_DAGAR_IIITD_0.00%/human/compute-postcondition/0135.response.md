The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the `results` list has at least one more element, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is an empty list, and `results` is a list containing at least one computed `res` value. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least one more element, and `result` will take the next value from the `results` list.

Since the loop has already processed one element in `results`, there must be at least one more element left in `results` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `results` must contain at least two computed `res` values.

State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing at least two computed `res` values**
