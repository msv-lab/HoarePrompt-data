The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. Given that `x` is the third element in `num_list`, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` will be increased by 1. 

The initial state specifies that `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary, and `x` is the third element in `num_list`.

After executing the code, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` will be updated, but all other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `num_of_lens[x]` incremented by 1, `x` is the third element in `num_list`.**
