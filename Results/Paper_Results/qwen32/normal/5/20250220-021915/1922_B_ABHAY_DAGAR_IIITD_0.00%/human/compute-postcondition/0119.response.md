Postcondition: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it, where `res` is updated to the previous `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains unchanged. `test_cases` is decremented by 1. `n` is an input integer. `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer. `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`. `cnt` is `next_cnt`.**
