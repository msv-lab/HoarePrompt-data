The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` to 1. This means that if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its value is overwritten to 1. If `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added with the value 1.

Given the initial state, the only variable that is directly affected by this code snippet is `num_of_lens`. The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `res`, and `total_count` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is used to update `num_of_lens`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the count of `x` is set to 1, `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`. `x` is the next element in `num_list`.**
