In the given for loop, the loop iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, the execution of the loop depends on the contents of `num_of_lens`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`.
- `res` is 0.
- `total_count` is 0.

To ensure that the loop executes, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair. This means that `num_list` must contain at least one integer, as `num_of_lens` is constructed based on the contents of `num_list`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `num_of_lens` has at least one entry.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0**
