The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the `num_of_lens` dictionary. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to update `cnt` to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` has already been used to update `total_count` and `res` based on its value and the conditions provided. Now, `cnt` needs to be updated to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`**.

Since we are only adjusting the state of `cnt` for the next iteration, and assuming there are more values in `num_of_lens.values()` to iterate over, we update `cnt` to the next value. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the previous `total_count` (before adding the previous `cnt`), `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`**.

To be more specific, if the previous `cnt` was the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`, the next `cnt` would be the second value. If there are no more values, the loop would terminate, but based on the task, we assume there are more values to process.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the previous `total_count` (before adding the previous `cnt`), `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`**.
