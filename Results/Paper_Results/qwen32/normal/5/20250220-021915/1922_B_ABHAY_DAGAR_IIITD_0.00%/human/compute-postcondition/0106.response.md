To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the provided initial and intermediate states.

The loop iterates over each element `x` in `num_list` and updates the `num_of_lens` dictionary accordingly. The loop will execute `len(num_list)` times, meaning it will process each element in `num_list`.

Given the intermediate states, we can infer:
- `results` is a list with `res` appended to it, and `res` remains unchanged.
- `test_cases` is decremented by 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_list` is a list of integers.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that counts the occurrences of each integer in `num_list`.

After all iterations, `num_of_lens` will contain the count of each unique integer in `num_list`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it; `res` holds its original value; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `num_of_lens` will have keys representing each unique number in `num_list` and their corresponding values will be the number of times each number appears in `num_list`. All other variables (`results`, `res`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `num_list`) will remain as described in the initial state, with the exception that `num_of_lens` will be fully populated.
