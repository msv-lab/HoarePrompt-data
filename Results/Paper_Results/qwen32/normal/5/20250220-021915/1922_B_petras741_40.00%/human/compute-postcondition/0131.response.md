The code snippet provided is `eta.append(j)`, which appends the current value of `j` to the list `eta`. However, `eta` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can infer that `eta` is an initially empty list (since it is being appended to).

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `eta` because `j` is appended to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `buffer`, `w`, `q`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[j]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `j` is the previous value incremented by 1, `eta` is a list containing the value `j`.**
