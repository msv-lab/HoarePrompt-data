The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, as `i` will start from 0 and increment up to `t-1`. The state of `n`, the list of integers, and `buffer` do not affect whether the loop will execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure `t` is greater than 0. The initial value of `i` is not something we need to specify since it is set by the `range` function in the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= `n`, `buffer` is an empty list**
