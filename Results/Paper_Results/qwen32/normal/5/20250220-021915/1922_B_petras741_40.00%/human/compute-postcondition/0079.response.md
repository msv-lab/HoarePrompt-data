The code snippet `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given the initial state, `j` is `x + 1`, and `eta` is either an empty list or a list containing elements that are incremented values of keys from the dictionary `q` where `q[j] > 0`.

After the execution of `eta.append(j)`, `eta` will now include the value of `j` (which is `x + 1`) at the end of the list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at each key `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in the range of `n`, `eta` is a list containing the element `j` (after it has been incremented by 1) and possibly other elements, `eta_ln` is 0, `rho` is not defined, and `j` is `x + 1`.**
