Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[j]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `j` is the previous value incremented by 1. If `q[j] > 0`, `eta` is a list containing the value `j`. Otherwise, `eta` is not defined.**
