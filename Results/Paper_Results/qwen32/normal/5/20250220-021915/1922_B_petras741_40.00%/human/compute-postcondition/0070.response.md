Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at each key `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in the range of `n`, `eta` is an empty list, `eta_ln` is 0, `rho` is not defined.**

Explanation: The code snippet `eta = []` reassigns `eta` to be an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.
