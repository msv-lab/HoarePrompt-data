Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and all values set to 0, `eta` is a list or dictionary where each element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` and `res` is the sum of contributions from all `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is calculated as the sum of the initial `res` value and the terms `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    q[w[j]] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[j]` is incremented by 1, `eta` is a list or dictionary where each element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is defined based on the conditions given, `res` is defined based on the conditions given.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[n]` is incremented by 1, `eta` is a list or dictionary where each element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is defined based on the conditions given, `res` is defined based on the conditions given, `j` is `n`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[0]` is incremented by 1, `eta` is a list or dictionary where each element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is defined based on the conditions given, `res` is defined based on the conditions given, `j` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
