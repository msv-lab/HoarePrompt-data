Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at each key `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in the range of `n`, `eta` is a list containing all keys from `q` for which `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the number of keys in `q` that have a value greater than 0, `rho` is `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]]`, `res` is updated to `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `j` is greater than 1000.**
