Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to n) for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, and `eta_ln` is not equal to 1.**
