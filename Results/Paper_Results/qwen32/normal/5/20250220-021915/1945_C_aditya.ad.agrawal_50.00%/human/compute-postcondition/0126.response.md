Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` that must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 1, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001. If `i` is 0, then `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1, and `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`. Otherwise, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 1, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, and `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 1. Additionally, `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`**
