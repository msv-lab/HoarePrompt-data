The code snippet `z_r -= 1` decrements the value of `z_r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` that must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 1, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001, and `i` is 0.**
