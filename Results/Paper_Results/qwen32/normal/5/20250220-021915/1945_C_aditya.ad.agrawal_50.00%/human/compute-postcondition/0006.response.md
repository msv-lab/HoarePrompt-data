The code `o = arr.count(1)` counts the number of occurrences of the integer `1` in the list `arr` and assigns this count to the variable `o`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`.**
