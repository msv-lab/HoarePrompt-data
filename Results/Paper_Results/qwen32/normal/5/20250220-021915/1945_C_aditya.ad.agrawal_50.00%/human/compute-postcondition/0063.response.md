The code snippet reassigns the value of `dist` to `abs(n / 2)`, and sets `ans` and `pos` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is the list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, `b_d` is the minimum `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where conditions were met or 30001**.
