Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is the list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` that must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 1, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is 1 and `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` that must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 1`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)` and `ans` is set to `pos`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)` if the condition is met, otherwise `b_d` retains its previous value. `i` is the next element in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` that must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 1`. If `i == 0`, `z_l` is `z_l + 1` and `z_r` is `z_r - 1`. If `i != 0`, `o_l` is `o_l + 1` and `o_r` is `o_r - 1`. If the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` is met, then `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)` and `ans` is set to `pos`. Otherwise, `b_d` retains its previous value and `ans` remains 0. `i` is the next element in `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
