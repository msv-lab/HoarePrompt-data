The code appends the character `s[i]` to the string `ans`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `d`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing `s[i]` appended to its previous value, `d` is a list of tuples sorted by cumulative balance of parentheses and must contain at least one more tuple.**
