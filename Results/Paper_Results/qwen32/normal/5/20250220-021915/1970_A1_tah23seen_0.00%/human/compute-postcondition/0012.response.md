Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with keys `0` and `1` where the value of key `0` is `0` and the value of key `1` is `d[0] - 1` if `s[1]` is ')', or `d[0] + 1` if `s[1]` is '(', `i` is 1**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `d[1]` is updated based on the character at index `1` in the string `s`. If `s[1]` is '(', then `d[1]` becomes `d[0] + 1`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`. If `s[1]` is ')', then `d[1]` becomes `d[0] - 1`, which is `0 - 1 = -1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
