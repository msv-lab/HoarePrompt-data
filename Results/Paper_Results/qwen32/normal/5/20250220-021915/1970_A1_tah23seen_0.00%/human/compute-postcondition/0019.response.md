The code `d.pop(n)` removes the key `n` from the dictionary `d`. Given the initial state, `d` had keys from `0` to `n` with `d[n]` being `0`. After executing `d.pop(n)`, the key `n` and its value `0` are removed from `d`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with keys from `0` to `n-1` where the values at these keys represent the cumulative balance of parentheses at each step, `i` is `n-1`.**
