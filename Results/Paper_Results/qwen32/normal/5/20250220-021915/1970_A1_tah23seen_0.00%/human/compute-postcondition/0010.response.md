The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `s`. If `i` is less than the length of `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `s` is a non-empty string. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with keys `0` and `1` where the value of key `0` is `0` and the value of key `1` is `1` if the character at index `i` in `s` is '(', and the value of key `1` is `-1` if the character at index `i` in `s` is ')', `i` is 1**
