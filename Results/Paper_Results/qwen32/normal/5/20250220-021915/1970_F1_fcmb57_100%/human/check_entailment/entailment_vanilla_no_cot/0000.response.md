Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to ensure it is correct:

1. **Handling the Quaffle**: The program does not keep track of the Quaffle's position. When a player catches the Quaffle, the program should update the Quaffle's position to the player's position. When a player throws the Quaffle, the Quaffle should be moved to the middle of the field.

2. **Checking Goals**: The program checks if a player is at a goal by looking at the player's position. However, the player must be carrying the Quaffle to score a goal. The program should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before checking if they are at a goal.

3. **Printing the Correct Team on Wrong Goal**: If a player scores in the wrong goal, the program should print the other team's name. The program currently does not do this.

4. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is defined after it is used, which will cause a `NameError`. The function should be defined before it is used.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
quaffle = None

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)

for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quaffle = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if quaffle == players[mo[0]]:
            quaffle = players[mo[0]]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        if quaffle == players[mo[0]]:
            quaffle = None
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        if quaffle is None:
            continue
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            else:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            else:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
        quaffle = ((m + 1) // 2 - 1, (n + 1) // 2 - 1)

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above and should work correctly for the given problem.
