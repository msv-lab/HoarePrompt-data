Let's analyze the provided Python program against the problem description.

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the dimensions of the field (N and M).
   - It initializes dictionaries for players and goals.
   - It also initializes a dictionary for movement directions.
   - It initializes the scores for both teams (pointsb and pointsr).

2. **Field Parsing:**
   - It reads the field line by line.
   - For each cell, it checks the content:
     - If it's a player (`R0`, `B1`, etc.), it adds the player to the `players` dictionary.
     - If it's a goal (`RG` or `BG`), it adds the goal to the `goals` dictionary.
     - It ignores empty cells (`..`) and the Quaffle (`Q`).

3. **Moves Parsing:**
   - It reads the number of moves.
   - For each move, it checks the action:
     - If it's a movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), it updates the player's position using the `func_1` function.
     - If it's a throw (`T`), it checks if the player is at a goal:
       - If the player is at a red goal (`RG`), it increments the blue team's score and prints the event.
       - If the player is at a blue goal (`BG`), it increments the red team's score and prints the event.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all moves, it prints the final score.

### Issues:

1. **Quaffle Handling:**
   - The Quaffle's position is not tracked.
   - When a player catches the Quaffle (`C`), the program does not update the Quaffle's position to the player's position.
   - When a player throws the Quaffle (`T`), the program does not reset the Quaffle's position to the center of the field.
   - The program does not check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before allowing a throw.

2. **Goal Scoring:**
   - The program checks if the player is at a goal to determine scoring, but it does not check if the player is carrying the Quaffle.

3. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic:**
   - The program increments the score for the wrong team if the player scores in their own goal.
   - It should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle and is at the opponent's goal before scoring.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined after it is used, which will cause a `NameError`.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified above, the program is not correct as it does not properly handle the Quaffle, does not check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before scoring, and has a logical error in the goal scoring process.

**Correctness: False**
