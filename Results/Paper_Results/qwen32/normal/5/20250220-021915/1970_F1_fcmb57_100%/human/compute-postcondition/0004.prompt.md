You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of strings representing the field, where each string contains pairs of characters separated by spaces. The first line of a contains two integers N and M (3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, and both are odd). The subsequent N lines each contain M pairs of characters representing the field's initial state. b is a list of strings, where each string describes an action performed by an entity in the format specified in the problem description. The number of actions in b is T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple where the first element is the string `x` concatenated with the integer `dx`, and the second element is the string `y` concatenated with the integer `dy`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of strings representing the field with the first line containing two integers N and M (3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, and both are odd), and `b`, which is a list of strings describing actions performed by an entity. The function returns a tuple where the first element is the string `x` concatenated with the integer `dx`, and the second element is the string `y` concatenated with the integer `dy`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple where the first element is the string `x` concatenated with the integer `dx`, and the second element is the string `y` concatenated with the integer `dy`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
