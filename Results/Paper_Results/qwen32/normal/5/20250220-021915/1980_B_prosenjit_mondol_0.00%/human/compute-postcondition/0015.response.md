Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer read from input; `f` is an integer read from input minus 1; `k` is an integer read from input minus 1; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `x` is the integer `a[f]`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then the current value of `a[k]` remains greater than `x`. Otherwise, `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`.**
