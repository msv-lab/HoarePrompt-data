Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer read from input; `f` is the second integer read from input minus 2; `k` is the third integer read from input minus 2; `a` is the new list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order; `x` is the integer `a[f]`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, then `a[k]` is less than `x` after sorting. If `a[k]` is not less than `x`, then `a[k]` is not less than `x` after sorting. If `a[k+1]` was greater than `a[f]` before sorting, then the current value of `a[k+1]` remains greater than `x` after sorting. Otherwise, `a[k+1]` is less than or equal to `x` after sorting.**
