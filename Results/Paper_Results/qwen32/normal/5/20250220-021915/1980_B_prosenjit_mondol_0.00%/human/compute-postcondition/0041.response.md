The function `func` accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the function receives three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` where `1 <= f, k <= n <= 100`, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 100`. 

The function processes each test case and returns a value based on the provided inputs.
