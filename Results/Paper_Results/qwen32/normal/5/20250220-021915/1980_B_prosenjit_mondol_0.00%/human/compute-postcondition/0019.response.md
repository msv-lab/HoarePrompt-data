Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer read from input; `f` is the second integer read from input minus 2; `k` is the third integer read from input minus 2; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `x` is the integer `a[f+1]`. If `a[k+1]` is greater than `x`, then the current value of `a[k+1]` remains greater than `x`. Otherwise, `a[k+1]` is less than or equal to `x`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
