Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines and prints whether the element at index `f` in the original list `a` is smaller than, larger than, or possibly equal to the element at index `k` in the list `a` when sorted in descending order.**
