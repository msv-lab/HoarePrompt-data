Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each of the t test cases, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    f -= 1
    k -= 1
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = a[f]
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    if a[k] > x:
        print('NO')
    elif a[k] < x:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer read from input; `f` is an integer read from input minus 1; `k` is an integer read from input minus 1; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `x` is the integer `a[f]`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then the current value of `a[k]` remains greater than `x`. Otherwise, `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer read from input; `f` is the second integer read from input minus 2; `k` is the third integer read from input minus 2; `a` is the new list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order; `x` is the integer `a[f]`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` remains greater than `x` after sorting. If `a[k]` is not greater than `x`, then `a[k]` is not greater than `x` after sorting. If `a[k+1]` was greater than `a[f]` before sorting, then the current value of `a[k+1]` remains greater than `x` after sorting. Otherwise, `a[k+1]` is less than or equal to `x` after sorting.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is the first integer read from input; `f` is the second integer read from input minus 1; `k` is the third integer read from input minus 1; `a` is a new list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order; `x` is the integer `a[f]` from the new list `a`. If `a[k] > x`, the condition does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, or `x`. Otherwise, the condition `a[k] < x` also does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, or `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
