### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, with the constraint that water can only be poured from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.

The logic in the function `func` is flawed. The program calculates `curr` as the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums`, where `last` is the last element of `nums`. However, this does not correctly determine if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers.

Here's why the logic is incorrect:

1. **Misunderstanding the Problem**: The key to solving this problem is recognizing that if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, it is theoretically possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers. The challenge is to determine if the given operation (pouring water from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index) can achieve this distribution.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The calculation `curr += i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums` does not correctly reflect the feasibility of the operation. It does not check if the water can be redistributed in such a way that all containers end up with the same amount of water.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case `n = 5` with `a = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`. The program calculates `last = 3` and `curr` as the sum of `i - last` for non-zero `i`, which is `(4-3) + (5-3) + (2-3) + (1-3) + (3-3) = 1 + 2 - 1 - 2 + 0 = 0`. According to the program, this would result in "YES", which is correct.
   - However, consider the test case `n = 3` with `a = [1, 2, 3]`. The program calculates `last = 3` and `curr` as the sum of `i - last` for non-zero `i`, which is `(1-3) + (2-3) + (3-3) = -2 - 1 + 0 = -3`. According to the program, this would result in "NO", which is correct.
   - But consider a more complex case like `n = 7` with `a = [4, 5, 5, 0, 6, 4, 4]`. The program calculates `last = 4` and `curr` as the sum of `i - last` for non-zero `i`, which is `(4-4) + (5-4) + (5-4) + (0-4) + (6-4) + (4-4) + (4-4) = 0 + 1 + 1 - 4 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 0`. According to the program, this would result in "YES", which is correct.
   - However, the case `n = 7` with `a = [6, 5, 5, 1, 3, 4, 4]` would incorrectly result in "NO" because the program calculates `last = 4` and `curr` as the sum of `i - last` for non-zero `i`, which is `(6-4) + (5-4) + (5-4) + (1-4) + (3-4) + (4-4) + (4-4) = 2 + 1 + 1 - 3 - 1 + 0 + 0 = 0`. According to the program, this would result in "YES", which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic used in the program is flawed and does not accurately reflect the requirements of the problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
