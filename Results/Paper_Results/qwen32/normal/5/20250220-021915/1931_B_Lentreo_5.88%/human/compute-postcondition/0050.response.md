The value of `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`. The values of `nums`, `i`, and `last` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers from the input and must have at least 1 element; `i` is not 0; `last` retains its original value; `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`.
Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input and must have at least 1 element; `i` is not 0; `last` retains its original value; `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`.**
