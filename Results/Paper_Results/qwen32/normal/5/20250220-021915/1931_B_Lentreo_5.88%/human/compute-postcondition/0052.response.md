The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the list `nums`. Therefore, we need to adjust these to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a list of integers from the input and must have at least 1 element.
- If `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`.
- `last` retains its original value.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has taken on the value of the last element in `nums`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least one more element that `i` can take.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input and must have at least 2 elements; `i` is the next element in `nums` after the last iteration; `last` retains its original value.**

Since `i` is the loop variable that iterates over `nums`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `nums`. The state of `last` and `curr` is not adjusted here as per the task requirement (only adjust the states of objects in the loop head).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `nums`**.
