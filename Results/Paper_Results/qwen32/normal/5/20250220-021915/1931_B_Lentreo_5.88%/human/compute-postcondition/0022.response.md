The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations to perform. The loop will execute `t` times, and the loop variable `_` does not affect the program state within the loop body. However, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` must be decremented by 1 after each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we only need to adjust `t` for the loop to execute one more time.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `curr` is the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums`, and `last` is the last element of `nums`. If `curr` is 0, then the current value of `curr` remains 0. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.

Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, and it determines how many more times the loop will execute, we decrement `t` by 1.

State: **`curr` is the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums`, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `t` is decremented by 1**
