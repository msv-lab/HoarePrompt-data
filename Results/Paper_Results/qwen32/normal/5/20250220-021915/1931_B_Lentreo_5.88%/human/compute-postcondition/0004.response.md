The code assigns the last element of the list `nums` to the variable `last`. The initial state of `t` and `nums` remains unchanged, while `n` is still an input integer. The value of `last` is now the last element of the list `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `last` is the last element of `nums`.**
