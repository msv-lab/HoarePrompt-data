Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic used in the program is flawed. Here's why:

The program calculates `curr` by summing up the differences between each element and the last element in the list, but this approach does not correctly check if the water can be evenly distributed among all containers.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if the cumulative sum of the differences (considering the target value each container should have) is always non-negative as we iterate through the list. This ensures that at no point do we need to take water from a container to the left of the current container, which is not allowed by the problem constraints.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        target = sum(nums) // n  # Each container should have this amount of water
        curr = 0
        possible = True
        for i in nums:
            curr += i - target
            if curr < 0:
                possible = False
                break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

In this corrected version, `target` is the amount of water each container should have if the water is evenly distributed. We then iterate through the list, maintaining a running total `curr` of the difference between the current amount of water and the target. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means we would need to take water from a container to the left of the current container, which is not allowed, and we set `possible` to `False`. If `curr` is never negative, it means we can distribute the water as required, and we print "YES".
