The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the list `nums`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `i` and how it will change as the loop progresses.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements
- `last` is the last element of `nums`
- `i` is the next element in `nums`

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current element being processed, and `last` was the previous element. For the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list `nums`.

Let's break it down:
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current element, and `last` was the element before it.
2. For the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `nums`.
3. `last` will be updated to the current `i` from the previous iteration.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be the next element in `nums` after the current `i`.
- `last` will be the current `i` from the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `last` is `i` from the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in `nums`**
