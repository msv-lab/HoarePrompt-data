Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input and must have at least 2 elements; `i` is the next element in `nums`; `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`**

Natural language description: The value of `curr` is updated by adding the difference between `i` (the next element in `nums`) and `last` to its current value. The values of `nums` and `i` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `nums` must have at least 2 elements is still valid.
