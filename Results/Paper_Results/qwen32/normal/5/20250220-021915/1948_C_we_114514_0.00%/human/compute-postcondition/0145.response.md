The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is 1
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one
- `n` is greater than 0
- `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`
- `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`
- `j` is incremented by 1

At the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value. Assuming `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration, we can represent the new state as:
State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `j` is `j + 1`**

However, to be more precise, let's assume `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`. Since the problem states `j` is incremented by 1, we can infer that if `j` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, it would be 1 at the start of the second iteration, and so on.

Thus, if `j` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, after the first iteration, `j` would be 1. So, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1 if it was 0 previously, 2 if it was 1 previously, and so on.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `j` is 1** (if `j` was 0 in the previous iteration)

Generalizing, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:
State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `j` is `j + 1`**

But to be specific for the next iteration, if `j` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `j` will be 1.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `j` is 1**
