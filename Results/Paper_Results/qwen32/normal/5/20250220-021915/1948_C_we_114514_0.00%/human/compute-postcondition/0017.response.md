Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<". If `reachable_first_row` is `True`, then `reachable_first_row` remains `True` and `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `row1[j]` is `'<'` and `row2[j]` is `'>'` for `j` less than `n - 1`, or if `row1[j]` is `'>'` and `j` equals `n - 1`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains `False`. If `reachable_first_row` is `False`, then `reachable_second_row` remains `False`.**
