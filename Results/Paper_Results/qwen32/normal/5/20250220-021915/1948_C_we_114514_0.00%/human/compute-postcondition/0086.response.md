Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least two tuples, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO', `j` is incremented by 1. If `reachable_first_row` is True, then `reachable_second_row` is True if `row1[j] == '>'` and `j` was equal to `n - 1`, or if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged (False). If `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. Additionally, `reachable_first_row` is set to False if `row1[j] != '>'`.**
