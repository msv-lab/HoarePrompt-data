Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, e.g., `[(4, "<<>>", ">><<")]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<", `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `reachable_second_row` is `False`. The current value of `reachable_first_row` is `True`. At the current index `j`, `row1[j]` is `'>'`. `j` is equal to `n - 1`.**
