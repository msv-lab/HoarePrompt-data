The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given that `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, we can deduce that `j` was 0 at the start of the previous iteration and became 1 at the end. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 2.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least two tuples, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO', `j` is 2. If `reachable_second_row` is True, it remains True. If `row2[j] == '>'` and `j == n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is set to True. If `row1[j] != '>'`, `reachable_first_row` is set to False. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged.**
