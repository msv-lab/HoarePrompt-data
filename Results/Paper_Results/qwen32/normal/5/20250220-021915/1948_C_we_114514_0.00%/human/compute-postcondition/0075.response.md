The provided Python code snippet assigns the value `True` to the variable `reachable_second_row`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least two tuples, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, and `results` is a list containing the string 'NO'. `reachable_first_row` is True, and `reachable_second_row` is True. Additionally, `row2[j]` is equal to `'>'`. `j` is equal to `n - 1`. If `row1[j]` is equal to `'>'`, `j` is equal to `n - 1`. If `row1[j]` is not equal to `'>'`, `j` is less than `n - 1`. The current value of `j` is `n - 1`.**
