The code snippet `reachable_second_row = True` sets the variable `reachable_second_row` to `True`. Since the variable `reachable_second_row` is already `True` in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. Therefore, the state of `reachable_second_row` remains `True`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<"` and `reachable_second_row` is `True`. `reachable_first_row` is `False`. `j` is 4.**
