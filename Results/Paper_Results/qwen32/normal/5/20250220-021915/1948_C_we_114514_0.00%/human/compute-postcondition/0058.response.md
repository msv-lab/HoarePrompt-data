Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `row1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False, and `results` is a list containing the string 'NO'.**

In this output state, the variable `reachable_second_row` has been set to False, and as a result, the `results` list now contains the string 'NO'. All other variables retain their initial values.
