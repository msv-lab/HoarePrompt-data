The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n`.

Let's break down the state:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value (let's assume it was `x`).
- For the next iteration, `j` should be `x + 1`, and this value must be less than `n`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and 'YES'. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then `results` remains unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1, so if `j` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is now `x + 1`. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `j` equals `n - 1`, then `row2[j]` is `'>'`.**

Since we are only adjusting `j`, and we don't have the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration, we can represent the next state as:

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and 'YES'. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then `results` remains unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `j` equals `n - 1`, then `row2[j]` is `'>'`.**

Since we need to be specific about the state of `j` at the start of the next iteration, we can assume `j` was `x` and is now `x + 1`. Given that we don't have the exact value of `x`, we can just state that `j` is incremented by 1:

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and 'YES'. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then `results` remains unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `j` equals `n - 1`, then `row2[j]` is `'>'`.**

Simplified and clearly stated:

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and 'YES'. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then `results` remains unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1.**
