Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `reachable_first_row` is True if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row1[j]` is not '>', otherwise it is False, `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` equals `n - 1` and `row1[j]` is '>', or if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', otherwise it remains False, and `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and 'YES' if `reachable_second_row` is True, otherwise it contains 'NO' and either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the original value of `reachable_second_row`.**
