Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `j` is 1. If `row2[j] == '>'` and `j == n - 1`, then `reachable_first_row` is True and `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, if `row2[j] == '>'` and `j < n - 1`, the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged. If `row2[j] != '>'`, the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.**
