The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` appends the key `k` to the list `cnt`. Given the initial state, `cnt` either contains the key `k` if `M[k]` is 1, or it is an empty list otherwise. After executing the code, `cnt` will definitely contain the key `k` because it has been appended.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with at least one key, `cur` is an integer, `cnt` is a list that contains the key `k`. `k` is the next key in `M` after the previous `k`.**
