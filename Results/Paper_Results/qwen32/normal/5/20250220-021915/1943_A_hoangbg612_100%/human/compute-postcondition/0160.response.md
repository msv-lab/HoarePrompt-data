To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `T`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `S` is the number of integers, and `N` is the list of integers.
   - The loop runs `T` times, once for each test case.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each test case:
     - `S` is read as the number of integers in the list.
     - `N` is read as the list of integers and then sorted.
     - `cur` is initialized to -1.
     - `M` is an empty dictionary that will store the count of each unique integer in `N`.
     - The loop iterates over the sorted list `N` to populate `M` and adjust `cur`:
       - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, `cur` is incremented by 1 and the inner loop breaks. Otherwise, `cur` is set to `num` and `M[num]` is set to 1.
       - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.
     - After the inner loop, if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`, `cur` is incremented by 1.
     - `cnt` is a list of keys from `M` where the value is 1.
     - If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `cur` is set to the second element of `cnt`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.
     - `cur` is printed.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After all iterations, the loop has processed all `T` test cases.
   - The variables `T`, `S`, and `N` are not retained across iterations and are re-initialized for each test case.
   - The final output is determined by the last test case processed.

Given the above, the final output state is determined by the last test case's `cur` value after processing all test cases.

**Output State: **the value of `cur` after processing the last test case.**

In natural language: The final output state is the value of `cur` after all test cases have been processed. This value is determined by the logic within the loop for the last test case, specifically how `cur` is updated based on the sorted list `N`, the dictionary `M`, and the list `cnt`.
