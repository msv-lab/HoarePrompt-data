Postcondition: **`M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is -1, `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` where the value is 1 (which is an empty list since `M` is empty), `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer. The current value of `num` is greater than `cur`.**
