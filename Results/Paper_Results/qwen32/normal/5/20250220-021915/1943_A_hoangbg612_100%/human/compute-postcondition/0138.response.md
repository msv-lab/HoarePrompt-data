The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with the value of `M[cur]` incremented by 1, `cur` is an integer, `cnt` is a list, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least two integers, and `num` is the next element in `N`.**
