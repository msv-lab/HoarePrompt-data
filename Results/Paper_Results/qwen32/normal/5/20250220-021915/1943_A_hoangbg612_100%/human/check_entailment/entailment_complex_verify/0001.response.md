### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code in detail to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
- On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.
- On Bob's turn, he picks an element from `a` and deletes it from `a`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score is the MEX of `c`, which Alice wants to maximize and Bob wants to minimize.
- We need to find the final score if both play optimally.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `S` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is not necessary for the optimal strategy, but it might be used to simplify the counting process.

3. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each element in `N`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates the dictionary `M` accordingly.

4. **Determining the MEX:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1` and is used to track the current MEX.
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and checks if the current number is greater than `cur`:
     - If the current number is greater than `cur + 1`, it breaks the loop and sets `cur` to `cur + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to the current number and increments its count in `M`.
   - After the loop, if the sum of counts in `M` is equal to `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - The program then creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` that have a count of 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, it sets `cur` to the second element of `cnt`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `cur` for each test case.

#### Issues in the Program:

- **Sorting:** Sorting the array is unnecessary for determining the MEX. The order of elements does not matter for counting the frequency of each element.
- **Counting Elements:** The dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each element, which is a valid step.
- **Determining the MEX:** The logic for determining the MEX seems flawed. The program does not correctly account for the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. The logic for breaking the loop and incrementing `cur` is not aligned with the optimal strategy.
- **Final Check with `cnt`:** The final check with `cnt` does not correctly reflect the optimal strategy either. The logic of setting `cur` to the second element of `cnt` is not aligned with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX.

#### Correctness:
The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. It fails to consider the alternating turns and the goal of maximizing and minimizing the MEX, respectively. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
