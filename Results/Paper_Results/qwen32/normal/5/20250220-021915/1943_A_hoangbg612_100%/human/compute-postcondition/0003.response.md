The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `N`. The variables `T` and `S` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the new list `N` containing integers from the input.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
