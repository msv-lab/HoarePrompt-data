Postcondition: **`M` is a dictionary, `cur` is an integer, `cnt` is a list, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, and `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `M` is `{num: 1}`, `cur` is `num`, and `cnt` is `[num]`. Otherwise, if `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, then `M` is `{-1: 1}`, `cur` is `-1`, and `cnt` is an empty list.**
