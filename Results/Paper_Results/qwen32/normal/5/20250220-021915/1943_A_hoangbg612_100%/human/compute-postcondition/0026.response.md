The only variable in the loop head is `num`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If there are more elements in `N` after the current `num`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`. Therefore, to proceed to the next iteration, `num` should be set to the next element in `N`.

Since we are only adjusting the state of `num` and based on the provided information, the next `num` should be the subsequent element in the sorted list `N`. We do not have specific values for `T`, `S`, `N`, `cur`, or `M` except for the fact that `N` has at least one element and is sorted in ascending order.

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`**. 

Since `N` must have at least 2 elements and `num` is currently the current element, for the loop to execute again, `num` needs to be updated to the next element in `N`.

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`**.

To be more specific, if `num` was the `k`-th element in `N`, it should now be the `(k+1)`-th element in `N`.

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N`**.

Given that `num` is the next element in `N` after the current `num`, we can represent this as the next element in the list. Since we don't have the specific values, we can denote it as `N[index + 1]` where `index` is the current position of `num` in `N`.

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N`**.

Since `num` is the next element in `N`, we can denote it as `N[index + 1]`. However, without the specific index, we can just denote it as the next element in `N`.

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`**.

To be precise and clear:
State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N`**.

Since `num` was the current element, it should now be the next element in `N`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`**. 

To explicitly denote the next element:
State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is `N[index + 1]` where `index` is the current position of `num` in `N`**.

Since we are not given the specific index, we can simply denote it as the next element in `N`:

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N`**.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N`**.
