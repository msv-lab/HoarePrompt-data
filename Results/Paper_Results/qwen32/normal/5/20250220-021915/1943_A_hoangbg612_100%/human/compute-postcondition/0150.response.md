The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. 

Given the initial state:
- `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair.
- `cur` is the last integer in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last integer in `N`.
- `cnt` is a list containing `k` if `M[k]` is equal to 1, otherwise `cnt` is an empty list.
- `T` is decremented by 1.
- `S` is the input integer.
- `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input.
- `k` is the next key in `M.keys()`.

After executing `cnt.append(k)`, the list `cnt` will now include `k` as an additional element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `cur` is the last integer in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last integer in `N`; `cnt` is a list containing the previous elements of `cnt` plus `k`; `T` is decremented by 1; `S` is the input integer; `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input; `k` is the next key in `M.keys()`.**
