The code snippet `cur += 1` increments the value of the variable `cur` by 1. The values of the other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, and `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is incremented by 1**.
