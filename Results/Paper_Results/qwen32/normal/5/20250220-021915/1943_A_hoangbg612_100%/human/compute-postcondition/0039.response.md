In the given task, the for loop iterates over the keys of the dictionary `M`. To ensure that the loop executes, the dictionary `M` must contain at least one key. The variables `T`, `cur`, `S`, and `cnt` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition, so we only need to ensure that `M` has keys for the loop to start.

Given the task:
- `T` is unchanged, which means it does not affect the loop's execution.
- `cur` is increased by 1 if the sum of the values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`. This does not affect the loop's execution condition.
- `cnt` is an empty list, which does not affect the loop's execution condition.
- The loop iterates over `M.keys()`, so `M` must have at least one key for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the dictionary `M` to ensure it has at least one key.

State: **`T` is unchanged, `cur` is unchanged, `S` is unchanged, `cnt` is an empty list, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key**
