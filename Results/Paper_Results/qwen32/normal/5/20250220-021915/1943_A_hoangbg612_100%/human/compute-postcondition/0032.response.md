The code provided is `M[cur] += 1`. This line increments the value at the index `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `M[cur]`, we can assume it could be any non-negative integer (including 0). After the operation, `M[cur]` will be its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N`; `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
