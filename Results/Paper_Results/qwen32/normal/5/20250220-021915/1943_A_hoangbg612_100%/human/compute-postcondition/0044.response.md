The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. This means that `cnt` will now include the key `k` from the dictionary `M`.

Output State: **`T` is unchanged, `cur` is unchanged, `S` is unchanged, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key, `k` is the next key in `M.keys()`, `cnt` has an additional element `k` appended to it.**
