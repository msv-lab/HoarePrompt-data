Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 1 element; `M` is an empty dictionary; `num` is greater than `cur`; `cur` is now equal to `num`.**
The value of `cur` has been updated to be equal to `num`. All other variables retain their initial states.
