The code snippet provided sets the variable `cur` to `-1`. This change affects the value of `cur`, but does not impact the values of `M`, `cnt`, `T`, `S`, or `N`. Since `cur` is explicitly set to `-1`, this value will be used in any subsequent operations.

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with at least one key, `cur` is -1, `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` where the value is 1, if the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `cur` is set to the second element of `cnt` (this condition is not applicable here as `cur` is now -1), `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input.**
