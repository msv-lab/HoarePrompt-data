The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. Since `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, and we are currently at the end of the previous iteration, `num` must be updated to the next element in the list `N`.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` held the value of the last processed element in `N`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next element in `N`. Since the list `N` is sorted and has at least one element, we can assume that there is at least one more element for `num` to take on.

State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is updated based on the comparison with `num`, `M` is a dictionary that will be updated based on the value of `num`**.

However, since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, the state of `num` is the only thing we need to specify:

State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in `N`**.
