Postcondition: **M is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from N and values as their counts. cur is the last integer in N plus 1 if the sum of the counts in M is equal to S, otherwise cur remains the last integer in N. cnt is a list containing all keys from M where the value is 1. T is decremented by the number of keys in M. S is the input integer. N is the sorted list of integers from the input. The length of cnt is greater than or equal to 2.**
