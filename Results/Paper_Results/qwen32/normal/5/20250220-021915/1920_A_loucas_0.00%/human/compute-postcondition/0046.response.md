To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided information.

The loop iterates from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` (since `range` in Python is exclusive of the stop value). During each iteration, it checks if the current value `i` is not in the list `no`. If `i` is not in `no`, it sets `num` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. If `i` is in `no`, it continues to the next iteration.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
1. The loop executed at least 3 times, which means `max(big) + 2 < min(less)`.
2. During each iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
3. If `i` was not in `no`, it set `num` to `i` and broke out of the loop.

Since the loop breaks as soon as it finds an `i` that is not in `no`, the final output state will be the first value `i` that is not in `no` within the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1`.

Let's denote the first value not in `no` within this range as `first_valid_i`. The output state after all iterations will be:
- `num` is set to `first_valid_i`.
- The loop terminates as soon as `first_valid_i` is found.

Output State: **num is set to the first value `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in `no`.**

In natural language, the final output state is that `num` will hold the value of the first integer in the range from the maximum value of `big` to one less than the minimum value of `less` that is not present in the list `no`.
