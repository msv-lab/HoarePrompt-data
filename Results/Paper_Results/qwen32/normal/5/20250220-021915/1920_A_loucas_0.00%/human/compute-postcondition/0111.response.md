Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is the first integer from input, `a` is the second integer from input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `a`, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.**
