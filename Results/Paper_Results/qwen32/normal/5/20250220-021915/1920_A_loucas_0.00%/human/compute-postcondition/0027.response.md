Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500
- `loop` is greater than 0
- `iterable` is 0
- `num` is 0
- `innerLoop` is greater than 0
- `x` is the first integer from the new input
- `a` is the second integer from the new input
- `iterable2` is 2
- If the new `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the old input and `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists.
- If the new `x` is 2, `less` contains the value of `a` and `big` is a list containing the second integer from the new input if the old `x` was 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list.
- If the new `x` is any other value, `no` contains the value of `a` and possibly other elements based on the previous value of `x`, and `big` and `less` are lists based on the previous value of `x`.

Code Snippet:
```python
big.append(a)
```

Impact:
- The value of `a` is appended to the list `big`. 

Output State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500
- `loop` is greater than 0
- `iterable` is 0
- `num` is 0
- `innerLoop` is greater than 0
- `x` is the first integer from the new input
- `a` is the second integer from the new input
- `iterable2` is 2
- `big` is updated to include the value of `a` at the end of the list.
- `less` and `no` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions.

In natural language, the output state is:
- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 500.
- `loop` remains greater than 0.
- `iterable` remains 0.
- `num` remains 0.
- `innerLoop` remains greater than 0.
- `x` retains its value as the first integer from the new input.
- `a` retains its value as the second integer from the new input.
- `iterable2` remains 2.
- `big` now includes the value of `a` appended to the end of the list.
- `less` and `no` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `loop` is greater than 0; `iterable` is 0; `num` is 0; `innerLoop` is greater than 0; `x` is the first integer from the new input; `a` is the second integer from the new input; `iterable2` is 2; `big` is updated to include `a` at the end of the list; `less` and `no` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions.**
