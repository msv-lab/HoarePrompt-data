The value of `num` is assigned the value of `i`. The other variables (`big`, `less`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `max(big) < min(less)` and `i` is not in `no` still holds true.

Output State: **`big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value, `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is not in `no`, `num` is equal to `i`.**
