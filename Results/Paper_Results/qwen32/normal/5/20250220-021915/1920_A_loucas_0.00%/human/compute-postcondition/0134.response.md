The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `num`, `iterable`, `loop`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `big`, `less`, `no`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is 1, `iterable` is `iterable + innerLoop`, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `big` is `[1]`, `less` is `[2]`, `no` contains all `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
