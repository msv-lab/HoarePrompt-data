Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. Here are the issues:

1. The program is intended to count the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints, but it only finds the smallest integer `k` that satisfies the constraints and prints it. Instead, it should count all such integers.

2. The program does not correctly handle the counting of integers that satisfy all constraints. It breaks the loop after finding the first valid integer and assigns it to `num`, which is then printed. This does not give the correct count of integers.

3. The program does not account for the possibility that there might be no integers `k` that satisfy all constraints (which should result in an output of 0).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = set()
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                big.append(x)
            elif a == 2:
                less.append(x)
            else:
                no.add(x)
        max_big = max(big)
        min_less = min(less)
        count = 0
        for i in range(max_big, min_less + 1):
            if i not in no:
                count += 1
        print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version:
- We use a set for `no` to allow for faster membership testing.
- We count all integers from `max(big)` to `min(less)` (inclusive) that are not in the `no` set.
- We print the count of such integers for each test case.
