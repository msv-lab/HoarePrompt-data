The code snippet assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `num`. The values of `big` and `less` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `max(big) < min(less)` is still valid. The value of `i` remains `i + 1` as it was in the initial state, and `num` now holds the same value as `i`.

Output State: **`big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value, `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `num` is `i + 1`**.
