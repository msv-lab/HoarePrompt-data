To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it evolves with each iteration.

### Understanding the Loop:
1. **Outer Loop (`for iterable in range(loop):`)**: This loop runs `loop` times.
2. **Inner Loop (`for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):`)**: For each iteration of the outer loop, this inner loop runs `innerLoop` times.
3. **Lists and Conditionals**:
    - `big` list: Collects `a` values where `x` is 1.
    - `less` list: Collects `a` values where `x` is 2.
    - `no` list: Collects `a` values where `x` is neither 1 nor 2.
4. **Finding `num`**:
    - The loop finds the smallest integer `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in the `no` list.
    - If such an `i` is found, it is assigned to `num` and printed.
    - If no such `i` is found (which should not happen given the problem constraints), `num` remains 0.

### Given Information:
- **After 1 iteration**: `num` is set to the first value `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in `no`.
- **After 2 iterations**: `num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was 2, `no` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` after the final iteration.
- **After 3 iterations**: `num` is 1, `iterable` is 2 (since it's incremented by 1 each iteration), `innerLoop` is unchanged, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `big` is [1], `less` is [2], and `no` contains all `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations (`loop` times), the state will be as follows:
- `iterable` will be equal to `loop` (since it was incremented by 1 in each iteration).
- `innerLoop` and `iterable2` will be in their final states as per the last iteration.
- `big`, `less`, and `no` lists will be in their final states as per the last iteration.
- `num` will be set to the first value `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in `no` for the last iteration.

### Conclusion:
The final output state after all iterations is:
Output State: **`iterable` is `loop`, `innerLoop` is the value from the last iteration, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1` from the last iteration, `big`, `less`, and `no` are the lists from the last iteration, `num` is the first value `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in `no` from the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, the loop will have completed all its iterations, and the final `num` value will be the result of the last iteration's computation, with all other variables reflecting the state from the last iteration.
