Output State: **`big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value, `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is not in `no`, `num` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `big`, `less`, `i`, `num`, and the condition `i is not in no` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program execution will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
