The code snippet appends the `result` to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated `results` list will now contain the initial `result` from `func_1(array)` and the newly appended `result`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be at least 0; `index` is `4 + 2n + n`; `results` is a list containing two `result` values from `func_1(array)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**.
