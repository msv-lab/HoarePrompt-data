Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.
- **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (length of the array) and `n` integers representing the array elements.
- **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum beauty of the array.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(array)`**: Sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
2. **`func_2()`**: Reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness of `func_1(array)`:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is because the difference between consecutive elements in a sorted array is minimized, and thus the absolute difference is maximized.
- **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty is calculated correctly as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Correctness of `func_2()`:
- **Input Handling**: The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the results correctly.
- **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it reads the array, calls `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty, and stores the result.

### Verification:
To verify the correctness, let's consider the examples provided:
1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
   - Sorted Array: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`
   - Output: `2`
2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
   - Sorted Array: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0`
   - Output: `0`
3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted Array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 57`
   - Output: `57`
4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted Array: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - Beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1`
   - Output: `1`
5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `2`, `2 1`
   - Sorted Array: `[1, 2]`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`
   - Output: `1`

The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty for each test case as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements of the problem description for all provided examples and potential cases. The logic used in `func_1` to sort the array and calculate the beauty is correct, and `func_2` handles multiple test cases accurately.

Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program sorts each array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements, which correctly maximizes the beauty as per the problem description. The input handling and output for multiple test cases are also correctly implemented.
