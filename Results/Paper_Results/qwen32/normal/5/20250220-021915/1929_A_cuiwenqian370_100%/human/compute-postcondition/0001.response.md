The code reads a line of input from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings, which are then assigned to the variable `data`. The initial state specifies that `array` is a list of integers with certain properties, but this list is not directly modified by the given code snippet. The variable `input` is a function to read from standard input, and its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each element a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**
