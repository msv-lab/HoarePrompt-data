You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: `array` is a sorted list of integers with length `n` such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, and each integer `a_i` in the `array` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in the `array`.
    return beauty
    #The program returns beauty, which is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in the sorted list `array`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, sorts it, and returns the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in the sorted list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each element a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` (not applicable as the loop has finished); `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be 0; `index` is `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + (t - 1)`; `results` is a list containing `t` `result` values from `func_1(array)`; `n` is not applicable as the loop has finished; `result` is not applicable as the loop has finished.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 3, `index` is `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + (t - 1)`, `results` is a list containing `t` `result` values from `func_1(array)`, `result` is not applicable as the loop has finished
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes a result using the function `func_1` and prints the result. The function does not return any value directly but outputs the results of each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, we need to break down the problem description and the solution provided.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the beauty of an array by rearranging its elements.
2. **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
3. **Input**: 
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, an integer `n` representing the length of the array, followed by `n` integers representing the array elements.
4. **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

### Solution Analysis:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
2. **Beauty Calculation**: After sorting, it calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements (since the array is sorted, `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` simplifies to `array[i] - array[i - 1]`).
3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` reads all input data at once, processes each test case, and stores the results. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Sorting for Maximum Beauty**: Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.
- **Handling Input and Output**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases, processes each one, and outputs the results as required.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array for each test case by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.

Correctness: **True**
