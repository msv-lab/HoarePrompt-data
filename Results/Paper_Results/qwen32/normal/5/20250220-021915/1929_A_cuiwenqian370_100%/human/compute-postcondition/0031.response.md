The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If there are more elements in the `results` list, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `result` is the second-to-last element in `results`, and `results` contains 2 `result` values from `func_1(array)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least one more element.

Since `result` at the end of the previous iteration was the second-to-last element, in the next iteration, `result` will be the last element of `results`.

State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is 2, `index` is `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + 1`, `results` is a list containing at least 3 `result` values from `func_1(array)`, `result` is the last element in `results`**
