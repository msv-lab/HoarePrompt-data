Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each element a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`.**

In simple terms, the value of `t` is now the integer representation of the first element in the `data` list, while `array` and `data` remain unchanged.
