Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 3, `index` is `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + (t - 1)`, `results` is a list containing `t` `result` values from `func_1(array)`, `result` is not applicable as the loop has finished**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `data` variable remains a list of strings. The variable `t` is an integer that represents the number of iterations the loop executed, and it must be at least 3. The `index` variable is calculated as `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + (t - 1)`, where `n1, n2, ..., nt` are some integers. The `results` list contains `t` results from the function `func_1(array)`, and `result` is not applicable since the loop has finished executing all its iterations.
