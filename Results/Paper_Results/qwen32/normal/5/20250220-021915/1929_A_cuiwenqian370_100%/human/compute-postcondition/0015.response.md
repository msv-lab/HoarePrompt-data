Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be at least 0; `index` is `3 + n`; `results` is a list containing the `result` from `func_1(array)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**

In simpler terms, the value of `array` has been updated to a list of integers obtained by converting the slice `data[index:index + n]` to integers. All other variables retain their previous values.
