To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step:

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the beauty of the array.
2. **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when the array is rearranged.
3. **Constraints**: 
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has an array length \( n \) (2 ≤ n ≤ 100).
   - Each element \( a_i \) in the array satisfies \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).

### Solution Approach:
1. **Sorting**: The provided solution sorts the array in ascending order.
2. **Beauty Calculation**: After sorting, it calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

### Reasoning:
- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is because the maximum difference between any two elements in a sorted array is between the smallest and the largest elements, and sorting ensures that these differences are spread out optimally.
- **Beauty Calculation**: By iterating through the sorted array and summing the differences between consecutive elements, the program calculates the maximum possible beauty.

### Verification with Examples:
1. **First Test Case**: 
   - Input: `[2, 1, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Beauty: `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`
2. **Second Test Case**: 
   - Input: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Beauty: `(69-69) + (69-69) = 0`
3. **Third Test Case**: 
   - Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
   - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - Beauty: `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`
4. **Fourth Test Case**: 
   - Input: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - Beauty: `(3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
5. **Fifth Test Case**: 
   - Input: `[2, 1]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
   - Beauty: `(2-1) = 1`

The results match the expected outputs for all test cases, confirming that the approach is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

**Correctness: True**
