Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 1; `index` is `2 + n`; `results` is a list containing the `result` from `func_1(array)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**

Natural Language: The `results` list now contains the `result` from `func_1(array)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
