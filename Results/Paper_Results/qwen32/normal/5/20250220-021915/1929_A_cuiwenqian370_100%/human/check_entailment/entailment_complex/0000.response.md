### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of an array, where beauty is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - To maximize this beauty, the optimal arrangement of the array is to sort it. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array are maximized compared to any other arrangement.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Input:** A list of integers `array` with length `n` such that `2 <= n <= 100`, and each integer `a_i` in the array satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.
   - **Process:** The function sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Output:** The function returns the calculated beauty.
   - **Correctness:** The function correctly computes the beauty of the array after sorting it, which is the optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Input:** Reads from standard input multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers.
   - **Process:** For each test case, it reads the input, calls `func_1` to compute the beauty, and stores the result.
   - **Output:** After processing all test cases, it prints the results.
   - **Correctness:** The function reads the input correctly, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and outputs the results appropriately.

4. **Combining Functions:**
   - The main function `func_2` orchestrates reading the input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and printing the results.
   - Both functions are correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as both functions are correctly designed to solve the problem as described. `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum beauty by sorting the array and summing the differences, and `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input, processing them, and outputting the results.

**Correctness: True**
