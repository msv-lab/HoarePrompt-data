The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. The loop iterates over the `results` list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.

Given the state before the loop starts, `results` is a list containing `t` `result` values from `func_1(array)`. Since `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be 0, `results` will be an empty list because `t` is 0.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` needs to be at least 1 so that `results` contains at least one element.

State: **`data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 1, `index` is `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + (t - 1)`, `results` is a list containing `t` `result` values from `func_1(array)`, `result` is not applicable as the loop has finished**
