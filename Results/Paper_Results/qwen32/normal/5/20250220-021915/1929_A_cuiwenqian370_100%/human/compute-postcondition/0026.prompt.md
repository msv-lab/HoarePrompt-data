Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `array` is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each element a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(array)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 1; `index` is `2 + n`; `results` is a list containing the `result` from `func_1(array)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be at least 0; `index` is `3 + n + n`; `results` is a list containing the `result` from `func_1(array)` and the newly appended `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be at least 0; `index` is `4 + 2n + n`; `results` is a list containing two `result` values from `func_1(array)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
