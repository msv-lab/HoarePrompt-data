The code snippet updates the `array` variable by mapping a slice of the `data` list to integers. Specifically, it takes the slice from `index` to `index + n` of `data` and converts each element to an integer, then assigns this list to `array`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 1; `index` is 2; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**

In simpler terms, `array` is now a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting at index 2 and of length `n`. All other variables retain their initial values.
