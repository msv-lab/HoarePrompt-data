Output State: **`array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be at least 0; `index` is `4 + 2n + n`; `results` is a list containing the `result` from `func_1(array)` and the newly appended `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**

In simpler terms, the `index` has been incremented by `n`, making the new `index` equal to `4 + 3n`. All other variables remain as they were initially described.
