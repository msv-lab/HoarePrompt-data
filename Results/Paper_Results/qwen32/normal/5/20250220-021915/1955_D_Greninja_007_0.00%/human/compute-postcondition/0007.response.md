Postcondition: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= m <= n`, `n` is an integer such that `m < n <= 2 * 10^5`, `m` is an integer such that `1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5`, all elements in `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `b`; `window_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `a`; `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of each element that appears in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`; `i` is 0. If `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is 1. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains 0.**
