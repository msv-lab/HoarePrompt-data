The code snippet creates a `Counter` object called `window_freq` that represents the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of the list `a`. The variables `a`, `b`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `good_subarrays`, and `b_freq` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of m integers, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, all elements in `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; `good_subarrays` is 0; `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `b`; `window_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `a`.**
