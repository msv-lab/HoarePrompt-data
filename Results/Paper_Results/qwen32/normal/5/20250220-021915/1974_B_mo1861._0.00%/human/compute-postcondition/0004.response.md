Let's analyze the provided state and the for loop statement step by step.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character.
- `i` and `c` are not set.
- `char_map` is a dictionary with one entry where `char_map[c]` is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

For loop statement:
```python
for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `c`.
2. **Loop Behavior**: The loop iterates over the sorted unique characters in the string `b`.
3. **State Adjustment**: At the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` and `c` based on the loop's behavior.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- The `enumerate` function will provide the next index and character from the sorted unique characters of `b`.
- Since `char_map` is dependent on `i` and `c`, we need to ensure that the next `i` and `c` are correctly set.

### Adjustment Process:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` and `c` were not set. This implies that the previous iteration was the first iteration.
- For the next iteration, `i` will be 1 (since `enumerate` starts from 0).
- `c` will be the second character in the sorted unique characters of `b`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `b` remains the same.
- `i` will be 1.
- `c` will be the second character in the sorted unique characters of `b`.
- `char_map` will be updated to reflect the new `i` and `c`.

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `i` is 1, `c` is the second character in the sorted unique characters of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with one entry where `char_map[c]` is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`**.

However, we need to ensure that `char_map` is correctly updated for the new `i` and `c`. Since `i` is now 1, `char_map[c]` should be `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 1 - 1))`.

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `i` is 1, `c` is the second character in the sorted unique characters of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with one entry where `char_map[c]` is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 2))`**.
