Output State: **`char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent unique character, in reverse order of their sorted appearance.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `char_map` will contain mappings of each unique character in `b` (when sorted) to a character in the alphabet starting from 'a' and going up to 'z', but in reverse order of their sorted appearance in `b`. For example, if `b` has unique characters 'b', 'c', 'a' in that order, `char_map` will map 'a' to 'c', 'b' to 'b', and 'c' to 'a'.
