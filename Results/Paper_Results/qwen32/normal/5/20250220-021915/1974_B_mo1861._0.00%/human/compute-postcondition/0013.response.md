The only object in the loop head is the variable `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `b`. If `b` has more characters, the loop will execute again for the next character.

At the end of the last iteration, `c` was the last character processed from the string `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must have more characters to process, and `c` should be the next character in the string `b`.

State: **`char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent unique character, in reverse order of their sorted appearance; `s` is a string that now includes the character `char_map[c]`; `b` must be a non-empty string with at least one more character to process; `c` is the next character in `b`**
