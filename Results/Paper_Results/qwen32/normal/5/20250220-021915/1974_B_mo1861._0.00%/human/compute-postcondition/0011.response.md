The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which will iterate over each character in `b`. Therefore, the state of `b` is the only thing that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

For the loop to execute, `b` must contain at least one character. The state of `char_map` and `s` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop itself, but they are part of the initial state provided.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent unique character, in reverse order of their sorted appearance; `s` is an empty string; `b` must be a non-empty string.**
