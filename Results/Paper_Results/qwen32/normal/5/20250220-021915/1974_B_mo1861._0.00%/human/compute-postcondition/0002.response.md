The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `c`, and the expression `sorted(set(b))`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `b` and the resulting set from it. If the set of characters in `b` has at least one unique character, the loop can execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `b` must be a string with at least one character. Since `char_map` is an empty dictionary and does not affect the loop execution directly, we do not need to adjust it. The variables `i` and `c` are initialized by the loop itself and do not need to be set before the loop starts.

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `i` and `c` are not set, `char_map` is an empty dictionary**
