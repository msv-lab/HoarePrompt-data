The code snippet modifies the value of `char_map[c]` by recalculating it based on the new formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. Given that `i` is 2, the new value of `char_map[c]` will be `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 3))`.

Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `i` is 2, `c` is the third character in the sorted unique characters of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with one entry where `char_map[c]` is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 3))`.**
