Output State: **`t` is the integer input, where 0 < `t` <= 100; the loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, a 2D list `a` containing 4 sublists of integers from input lines has been processed. `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in the current `a`, and `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`. The loop prints `dx * dx` for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the loop will have executed `t` times, processing `t` sets of 4 lines of input each. For each set, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum of the first elements of the four sublists and prints the square of that difference. The value of `t` will be reduced to 0 as the loop completes all iterations.
