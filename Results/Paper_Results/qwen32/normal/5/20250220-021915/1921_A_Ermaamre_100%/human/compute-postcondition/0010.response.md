To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer input, where 1 <= `t` <= 100.
2. `a` is a 2D list containing 4 sublists, each sublist contains integers from a line of input.
3. `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a`.
4. `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print(dx * dx)
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **List `a` Structure**:
   - `a` is a 2D list with 4 sublists.
   - Each sublist contains integers from a line of input.
   - For example, `a` could be `[[a11, a12, a13], [a21, a22, a23], [a31, a32, a33], [a41, a42, a43]]`.

2. **List `x` Construction**:
   - `x` is constructed by taking the first element of each sublist in `a`.
   - Therefore, `x` would be `[a11, a21, a31, a41]`.

3. **Calculation of `dx`**:
   - `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.
   - Mathematically, `dx = max(x) - min(x)`.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The `print` statement outputs `dx * dx`.
   - Since `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`, `dx * dx` is the square of this difference.

### Final Output:
The output of the `print` statement is the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list x)**
