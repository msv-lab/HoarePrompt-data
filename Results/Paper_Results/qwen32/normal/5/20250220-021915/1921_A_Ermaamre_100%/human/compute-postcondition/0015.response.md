Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input where 0 < `t` <= 100.
- `a` is a new 2D list containing 4 sublists, each sublist contains integers from a line of input.
- `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in the updated `a`.
- `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the updated list `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(dx * dx)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `a`**:
   - `a` is a 2D list with 4 sublists.
   - Each sublist contains integers from a line of input.

2. **Understanding `x`**:
   - `x` is a list that contains the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a`.
   - If `a` is structured as `[[a11, a12, ...], [a21, a22, ...], [a31, a32, ...], [a41, a42, ...]]`, then `x` will be `[a11, a21, a31, a41]`.

3. **Understanding `dx`**:
   - `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.
   - If `x` contains the values `[a11, a21, a31, a41]`, then `dx` will be `max(a11, a21, a31, a41) - min(a11, a21, a31, a41)`.

4. **Understanding `print(dx * dx)`**:
   - The code snippet prints the square of `dx`.
   - Hence, the output will be `(max(a11, a21, a31, a41) - min(a11, a21, a31, a41)) ** 2`.

### Final Output:
The `print(dx * dx)` statement will print the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the first elements of the four sublists in the 2D list `a`.

Output: **(max(a11, a21, a31, a41) - min(a11, a21, a31, a41)) ** 2 (where a11, a21, a31, a41 are the first elements of the four sublists in the 2D list `a`)**
