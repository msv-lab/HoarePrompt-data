To determine what will be printed, let's break down the problem step by step using the given initial state:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 100. However, the value of `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output of the `print(dx * dx)` statement.

2. **Variable `a`**: It is a 2D list containing 4 sublists. Each sublist contains integers from a line of input. For example, `a` could be something like this:
   ```
   a = [
       [1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6],
       [7, 8, 9],
       [10, 11, 12]
   ]
   ```

3. **Variable `x`**: It is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a`. Using the example above, `x` would be:
   ```
   x = [1, 4, 7, 10]
   ```

4. **Variable `dx`**: It is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`. Continuing with the example:
   - The maximum value in `x` is 10.
   - The minimum value in `x` is 1.
   - Therefore, `dx` would be `10 - 1 = 9`.

5. **The `print(dx * dx)` statement**: This statement will print the square of `dx`. Using the value of `dx` from the example, `dx * dx` would be `9 * 9 = 81`.

Since we do not have the exact values of the sublists in `a`, we can describe the output in terms of the variables:

- `x` is a list of the first elements of each sublist in `a`.
- `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.
- The output will be the square of `dx`.

Thus, the final output description is:

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list x, and x is a list of the first elements of each sublist in a)**
