Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the area of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and then squaring that difference. However, this approach is incorrect because the side length of the square could be determined by the difference in y-coordinates if the x-coordinates of the corners are the same. The correct approach is to find the unique x and y coordinates, compute the differences between the maximum and minimum of these coordinates, and then determine the side length of the square as the maximum of these two differences. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        y = [p[1] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        dy = max(y) - min(y)
        side_length = max(dx, dy)
        print(side_length * side_length)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This version correctly calculates the side length of the square by considering both the x and y coordinates.
