The code snippet calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`. Since `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a`, the value of `dx` will be updated to reflect this calculation. The values of `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input, where 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a` is a 2D list containing 4 sublists, each sublist contains integers from a line of input; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.**
