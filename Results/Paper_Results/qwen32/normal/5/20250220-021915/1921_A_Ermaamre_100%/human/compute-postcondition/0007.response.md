The code provided reads 4 lines of input, each line containing integers, and updates the 2D list `a` with these integers. The lists `x` and `dx` are not directly affected by this code snippet, but `a` is completely reassigned.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input, where 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a` is a 2D list containing 4 sublists, each sublist contains integers from a line of input; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.**

Here, `a` has been updated to contain the new input values, but `t`, `x`, and `dx` retain their previous definitions and values.
