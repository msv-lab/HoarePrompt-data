The `break` statement in the given code snippet will terminate the loop or block of code that it is inside, but it does not affect the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `re`, `res`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, then `re` is incremented by 1 and `res` contains the element `a[i]` appended to it, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
