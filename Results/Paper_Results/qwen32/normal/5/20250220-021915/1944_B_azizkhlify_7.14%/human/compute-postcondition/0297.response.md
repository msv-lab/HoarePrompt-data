To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **Variable `n`**: It is mentioned that `n` must be at least 1, but its exact value is not given.
2. **List `res`**: All elements of `res` have been printed, but the contents of `res` are not relevant to the current `print` statement.
3. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is updated to `i + 2`. This means that `i` has been incremented by 2 from its previous value.
4. **List `a`**: The elements of `a` are not explicitly provided, but the elements at indices `i` and `i` (which is the same index) will be printed.

Given this information, the `print` statement will output the element at index `i` of list `a` twice, followed by a space.

Since the exact values of `i` and the contents of list `a` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, we can describe the output in terms of the list `a` and the index `i`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i of the list a)**
