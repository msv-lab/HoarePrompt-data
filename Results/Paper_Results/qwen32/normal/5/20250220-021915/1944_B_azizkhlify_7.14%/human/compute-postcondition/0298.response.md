The code snippet `ur += 2` increments the value of the variable `ur` by 2. The other variables mentioned in the initial state (`n`, `res`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, all elements of `res` have been printed, `i` is `i + 2`, `ur` is increased by 2.**
