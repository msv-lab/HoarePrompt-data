The provided code snippet only contains a `print()` statement without any arguments. In Python, when `print()` is called without any arguments, it outputs a newline character.

Given the initial state description, it doesn't provide any specific information about what should be printed inside the `print()` statement. The only action described is that it will print something, and since there are no arguments, it will print a newline.

Therefore, the output will be an empty line.

Output: **(newline)**
