Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the second half of `a` (from `a[n]` to `a[2 * n - 1]`).
- `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `k` is not zero if `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
- `re` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ul` and `ur` beyond their initial conditions.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- The code snippet prints `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and the `end=' '` parameter ensures that there is a space at the end of the print statement rather than a newline.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to the second element of the list `a` (because list indices in Python are 0-based).
- The exact value of `a[1]` is not provided in the initial state, so we will describe it as `a[1]`.

### Final Output:
The code will print the second element of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[1] a[1] ** (where `a[1]` is the second element of the list `a`)
