Output State: **All elements of `res` have been printed. The variables `l` and `r` reflect the counts of elements in the respective halves of `a`. The variables `ul` and `ur` are equal, indicating that the number of elements appearing exactly twice in the left and right halves of `a` have been balanced. The variable `k` has been adjusted and used to print the required number of elements appearing exactly once. The loop has terminated after processing all test cases.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished processing all test cases. For each test case, it has printed pairs of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a` from both halves, and then printed additional elements that appear exactly once until the required count `k` is met. The loop ensures that the number of elements appearing exactly twice in the left and right halves of the list are balanced by the end of each test case.
