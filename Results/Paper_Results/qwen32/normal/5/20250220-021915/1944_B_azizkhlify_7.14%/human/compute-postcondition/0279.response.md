To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and understand the variables involved:

1. **`i`**: The description states that `i` is the next element in `res` after `next_element_in_res`. This means `i` is some element in the list `res` that comes after another element `next_element_in_res`. However, the exact value of `i` is not provided directly; it depends on the current state of the list `res` and the position of `next_element_in_res` within that list.

2. **`res`**: The list `res` contains at least one value of `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`. This means that `res` includes elements from the list `a` that meet a specific condition related to the list `l`.

3. **`l`**: This is a list of length `n` with elements incremented based on values in `a` from `0` to `n-1`. This implies that `l` keeps track of the occurrences of values in the first half of the list `a`.

4. **`r`**: This is a list of length `n` with elements incremented based on values in `a` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`. This implies that `r` keeps track of the occurrences of values in the second half of the list `a`.

5. **`n`**: It is given that `n` is greater than `0`.

6. **`ul` and `ur`**: These are set to `2 * n` and `0` respectively, but they are not directly involved in the `print(i, end=' ')` statement.

7. **`k`**: This is an integer, and `re` is the number of elements in `res` up to `k`. This indicates that `res` might be truncated or limited to `k` elements.

Given the information, the specific value of `i` cannot be determined exactly without knowing the current state of `res` and the position of `next_element_in_res`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variable `i`.

Output: **i (where i is the next element in the list `res` after `next_element_in_res`)**
