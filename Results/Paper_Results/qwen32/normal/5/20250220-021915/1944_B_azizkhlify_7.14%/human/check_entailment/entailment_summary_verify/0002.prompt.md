You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `2n` integers. It then prints pairs of integers that appear exactly twice in the list, ensuring that `k` pairs are printed from the first half of the list. If fewer than `k` pairs are found in the first half, it prints additional integers that appear exactly once until `k` pairs and `k` single integers are printed in total. Finally, it balances the output by printing pairs from the second half of the list if necessary.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to find two arrays `l` and `r`, each of length `2k`, such that:
- `l` is a subset of the first `n` elements of `a`.
- `r` is a subset of the last `n` elements of `a`.
- The bitwise XOR of all elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of all elements in `r`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two arrays `l` and `r` are initialized to store counts of each number in the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
   - Variables `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` are initialized. `re` and `res` seem to be used to store remaining elements and a result set, respectively.

3. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of each number in the first `n` elements of `a` and stores them in `l`.
   - It counts the occurrences of each number in the last `n` elements of `a` and stores them in `r`.

4. **Building Arrays `l` and `r`:**
   - The program first tries to add pairs of numbers that appear twice in the first half of `a` to the output `l` until it reaches `2k` elements.
   - If not enough pairs are found, it adds single occurrences of numbers from the first half of `a` to `l` until it reaches `2k` elements.
   - It then prints the corresponding elements to `r` based on the elements added to `l`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `l` and `r` on separate lines.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Counting and Output:**
   - The program initializes `l` and `r` with size `n` instead of `2k`.
   - The program uses `l[a[i] - 1]` and `r[a[i] - 1]` to count occurrences, which is correct, but the logic for building `l` and `r` is flawed.
   - The program does not correctly ensure that `l` and `r` have the same XOR value.

2. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The program does not account for the requirement that `l` and `r` must have the same XOR value.
   - The program does not handle the case where `ul` (number of elements in `l`) is not equal to `ur` (number of elements in `r`).

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program does not correctly format the output to ensure `l` and `r` are subsets of the correct halves of `a`.

### Correctness

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of elements in `r`, and it does not correctly handle the subsets.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
