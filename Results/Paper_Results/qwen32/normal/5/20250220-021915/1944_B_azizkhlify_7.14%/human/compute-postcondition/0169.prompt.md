Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `2 * k - ul`; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the second half of `a` (from `a[n]` to `a[2 * n - 1]`); `ul` is the sum of all increments of 2 when `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, up to the point where `ul` equals `k * 2` or the loop completes all `n` iterations; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `k` is not zero (since the if condition is true); `re` is 0; `i` is the last index of the loop, which is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations, or the index where `ul` equals `k * 2` if the loop breaks early.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is greater than 0; if `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `re` does not equal `k` and the state of `res` remains as it was before the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1. If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, then `re` is incremented by 1 and `res` includes the element `a[i]`. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, then `re` is incremented by 1 and `res` contains the element `a[i]` appended to it. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop or statement continues as per the original conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
