To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context provided.

### Initial State Analysis:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `k` is defined as `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.
- `ul` is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2.
- `ur` is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `re` is not explicitly defined in the given context, but if `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- `res` is an empty list. If `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `res` remains an empty list.

### Key Points:

- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- The `print` statement is `print(a[i], end=' ')`, which means it will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`, followed by a space.

### What Will Be Printed:

Since `i` is set to 2, the statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` will print the element at index 2 of the list `a`, followed by a space.

Given the initial state, we do not have the exact values of the elements in the list `a`. However, we know that `i` is 2, so we can describe the output in terms of the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the element at index 2 of the list a)**
