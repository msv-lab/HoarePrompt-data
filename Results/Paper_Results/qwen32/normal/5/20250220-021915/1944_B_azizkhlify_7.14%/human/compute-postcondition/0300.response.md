The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will terminate the innermost loop or if statement it is placed within. However, it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `res`, `i`, and `ur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, all elements of `res` have been printed, `i` is `i + 2`, and the state of other variables remains unchanged. If `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, then `ur` is increased by 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
