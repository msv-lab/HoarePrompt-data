In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `_` and the range is determined by `int(input())`. This means that the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer input value that must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. 

Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, we don't need to adjust it. The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the input value `t`, which determines the number of iterations.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**

The other variables `n`, `k`, and the list `a` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. They will be handled within the loop body, which is not shown in the provided code snippet.
