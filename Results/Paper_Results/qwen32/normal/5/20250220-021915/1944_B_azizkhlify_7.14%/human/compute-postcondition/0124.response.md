Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the second half of `a` (from `a[n]` to `a[2 * n - 1]`); `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `k` is not zero if `ul` != `ur`; `re` is 0; `i` is `2 * n - 1`; the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is equal to 2.**
