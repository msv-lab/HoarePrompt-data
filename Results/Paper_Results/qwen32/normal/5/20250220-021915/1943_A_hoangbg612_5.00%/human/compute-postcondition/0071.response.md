The code snippet `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. None of the other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, `num`) are affected by this operation. 

So, the Output State is:
Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is increased by 1**.
