The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program. The loop will execute `T` times regardless of the state of `N`, `S`, `M`, and `cur`.

Since the loop variable `_` does not influence the program state, and there are no other variables in the loop head to adjust, the state remains the same for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `S` is an input integer, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, and `cur` is the smallest integer `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, or it remains the initial `cur` if no such `i` is found within the range of the loop.**
