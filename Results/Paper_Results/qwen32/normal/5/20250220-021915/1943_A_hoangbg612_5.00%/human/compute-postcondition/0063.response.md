Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `cur` is 0, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is greater than `cur`, and the current value of `cur` is less than `num`. Additionally, `num` is greater than `cur + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
