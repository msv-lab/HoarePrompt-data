Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is an empty dictionary; `cur` is -1; `num` is an integer such that `num > cur`. The current value of `cur` is -1, and `num` is greater than -1, and `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.**
