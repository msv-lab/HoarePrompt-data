Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers; `cur` is equal to `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `T`, `S`, `N`, `cur`, and `i` remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
