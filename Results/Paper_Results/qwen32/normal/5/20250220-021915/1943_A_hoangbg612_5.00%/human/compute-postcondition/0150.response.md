Postcondition: **`cur` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is set to the incremented value of `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `cur` and `i` is still incremented by 1.**
