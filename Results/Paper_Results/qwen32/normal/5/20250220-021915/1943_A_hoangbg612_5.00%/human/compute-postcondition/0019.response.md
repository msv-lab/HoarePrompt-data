Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 1 integer; `num` is the next integer in `N`; `cur` is increased by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, and `num`) remain unchanged.
