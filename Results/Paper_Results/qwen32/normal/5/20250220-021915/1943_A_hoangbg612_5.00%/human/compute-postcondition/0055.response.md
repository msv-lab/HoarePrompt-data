The provided code snippet updates the variable `N` by reading a new list of integers from the input. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `cur`, and the previous value of `N`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is the new list of integers from the input, `cur` remains the smallest index `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, or if no such `i` exists within the range, `cur` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
