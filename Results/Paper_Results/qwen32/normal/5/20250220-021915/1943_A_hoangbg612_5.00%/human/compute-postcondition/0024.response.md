The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` increments the value at the index `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. The initial state specifies that `T` is greater than 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one integer, and `num` is the next integer in `N`. However, the variable `M` and the index `cur` are not mentioned in the initial state, so we can infer that `M` is a dictionary and `cur` is a key in this dictionary.

After executing the code, the value of `M[cur]` is increased by 1. The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 1 integer; `num` is the next integer in `N`; `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
