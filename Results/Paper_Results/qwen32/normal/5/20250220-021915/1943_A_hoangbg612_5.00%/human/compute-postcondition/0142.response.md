To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `cur`. The loop will execute if `cur` is greater than 0, as `range(cur)` will generate values from 0 up to, but not including, `cur`.

The state before the loop starts includes:
- `cur` is the last element of `N`.
- `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `N` and values as their counts.
- If the sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`, then `cur` is the last element of `N` plus 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains the last element of `N`.

Given this information, to ensure the loop executes, `cur` must be greater than 0. Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **If the sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`**:
   - `cur` would be the last element of `N` plus 1.
   - For `cur` to be greater than 0, the last element of `N` must be at least -1 (since -1 + 1 = 0, which is not greater than 0, so it must be at least 0).

2. **If the sum of the values in `M` is not equal to `S`**:
   - `cur` would be the last element of `N`.
   - For `cur` to be greater than 0, the last element of `N` must be greater than 0.

Since we are only allowed to adjust the states of `i` and `cur`, and `i` is initialized by the loop itself, the only variable we need to ensure is `cur`. Therefore, we need to make sure `cur` is greater than 0.

State: **`cur` must be greater than 0**.
