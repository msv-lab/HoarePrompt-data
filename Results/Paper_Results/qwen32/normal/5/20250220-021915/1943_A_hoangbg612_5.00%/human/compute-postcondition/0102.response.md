Postcondition: **`N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, the last number processed in `N` is at least 0, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to the next part of the code.**
