Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, `i`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
