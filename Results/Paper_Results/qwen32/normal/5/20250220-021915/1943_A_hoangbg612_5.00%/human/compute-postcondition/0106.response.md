The code snippet provided is `S = int(input())`. This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `S`. The other variables (`N`, `M`, and `cur`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `S` is an input integer, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, and `cur` is the smallest integer `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, or it remains the initial `cur` if no such `i` is found within the range of the loop.**
