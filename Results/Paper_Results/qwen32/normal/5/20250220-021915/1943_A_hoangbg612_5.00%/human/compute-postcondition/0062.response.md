Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `cur` is 0, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `num` is greater than `cur`. The current value of `cur` is less than `num`. Additionally, `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, so `cur` is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
