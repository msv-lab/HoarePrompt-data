The `break` statement will terminate the current loop or conditional block, but it does not affect the values of the variables `cur` and `M[i]`. Therefore, the values of `cur` and `M[i]` remain as they were in the initial state. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the information that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`cur` is equal to `i`, `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
