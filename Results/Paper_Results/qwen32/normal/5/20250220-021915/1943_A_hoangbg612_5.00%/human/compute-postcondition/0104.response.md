To determine the output of the `print(cur)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the logic implied by the description:

1. **N**: A non-empty sorted list of integers. For example, `N = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`.
2. **S**: An input integer. The value of `S` is not used in the given print statement, so it can be ignored for now.
3. **M**: A dictionary where keys are consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values are their counts in `N`. Using the example `N = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, `M` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}`.
4. **cur**: The smallest integer `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, or it remains the initial `cur` if no such `i` is found within the range of the loop. The initial value of `cur` is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the context, it is likely to be the smallest number in `N`.

Let's walk through the logic to find `cur`:

- Iterate over the keys of `M` starting from the smallest number in `N`.
- For each key `i`, check if `M[i] <= i`.
- If such an `i` is found, set `cur` to that `i` and break out of the loop.
- If no such `i` is found, `cur` remains the initial `cur`.

Given the example `N = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]` and `M = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}`:

- Check `i = 1`: `M[1] = 1` and `1 <= 1` is true. So, `cur` is set to `1` and the loop breaks.

Thus, `cur` will be the smallest integer in `N` that satisfies the condition `M[i] <= i`.

If we generalize this, `cur` will be the smallest integer in `N` such that the count of that integer in `N` is less than or equal to the integer itself. If no such integer is found, `cur` remains the smallest number in `N`.

Since the exact list `N` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `cur`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `cur`.

Output: **cur (where cur is the smallest integer in N such that M[cur] <= cur, or the smallest integer in N if no such integer is found)**
