The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `N` and the current value of `num`. Since the loop iterates over `N`, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next element in the list `N`.

Given that `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, and we are at the end of the previous iteration, `num` should be the next element in the list `N` for the next iteration to occur. The states of `N`, `S`, `M`, and `cur` should remain as they are, except for `num` which will be updated to the next element in the list.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the `k`-th element in the list `N`. For the next iteration, `num` should be the `(k+1)`-th element in the list `N`.

State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary; `num` is the next element in the list `N`**.
