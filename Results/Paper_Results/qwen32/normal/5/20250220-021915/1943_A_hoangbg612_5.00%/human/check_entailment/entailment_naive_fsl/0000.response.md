Let's analyze the provided program for the given problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program aims to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Optimal Play**: Both players are playing optimally.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX.
2. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
3. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and appending/deleting them as described.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.

#### Program Logic:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `N`.
2. **Sorting**: The array `N` is sorted.
3. **Tracking Elements**: A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each element in `N`.
4. **Determining MEX**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array and keeps track of the current MEX (`cur`).
   - If the current number in the array is greater than `cur + 1`, it breaks the loop and sets `cur` to `cur + 1`.
   - If the current number is equal to `cur`, it increments the count in the dictionary.
5. **Final Adjustment**:
   - After the loop, if all numbers from `0` to `cur` are present in the array, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then checks if there is any number `i` from `0` to `cur` such that `M[i] <= i`. If found, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop.
6. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `cur` for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly.
2. **Optimal Strategy**: The program does not explicitly implement the optimal strategy for both players.
3. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation might not be accurate for all scenarios.

### Example of a Potential Issue:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
0 0 0
```
- Alice can pick `0` and append it to `c`.
- Bob picks `0` and deletes it from `a`.
- Alice picks `0` and appends it to `c`.
- Bob picks `0` and deletes it from `a`.
- `a` is now empty, and `c` is `[0, 0]`.
- The MEX of `[0, 0]` is `1`.

However, the program might not handle this scenario correctly due to the way it tracks and increments `cur`.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential issue identified, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and might not implement the optimal strategy for both players.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle scenarios where the array contains repeated elements or where the MEX calculation requires a more sophisticated approach to determine the optimal moves for both players. The identified test case demonstrates a potential issue where the program might not produce the correct MEX value.
