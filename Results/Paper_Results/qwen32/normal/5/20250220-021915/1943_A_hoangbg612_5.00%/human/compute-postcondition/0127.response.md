The code assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. The value of `cur` is equal to `num`, which is the next element in the sorted list `N`. The other variables (`N`, `S`, `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and `1` as its value; `num` is the next element in the list `N`; `cur` is now equal to `num`.**
