The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. The value of `cur` is equal to `num`, which is the next integer in the sorted list `N`. This operation does not affect the values of `T`, `S`, `N`, `num`, or `cur` directly, but it does modify the dictionary `M`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 1 integer; `num` is the next integer in `N`; `cur` is equal to `num`; `M[cur]` is 1.**
