Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary; `num` is the next element in the list `N`; `cur` is now equal to `num`.**

Natural Language: The value of `cur` has been updated to be equal to `num`. All other variables (`N`, `S`, `M`, and `num`) retain their previous values and conditions.
