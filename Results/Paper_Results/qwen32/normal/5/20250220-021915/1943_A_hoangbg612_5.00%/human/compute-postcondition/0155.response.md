To determine the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variable `cur`.

Let's break down the loop logic:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = cur - 1`.
- Inside the loop, it checks if `M[i] <= i`. 
- If the condition is true, `cur` is set to `i` and the loop breaks.
- If the condition is not true for any `i` in the range, `cur` remains unchanged.

The loop terminates when either:
1. The condition `M[i] <= i` is met for some `i`, and `cur` is set to that `i`.
2. The loop completes all iterations without finding any `i` such that `M[i] <= i`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, we can deduce the following:
- If `cur` is initially greater than 0, the loop will start executing.
- The loop will continue to increment `i` until it either finds an `i` such that `M[i] <= i` or it exhausts all iterations up to `cur - 1`.

The final value of `cur` will be the smallest `i` for which `M[i] <= i`, or it will remain unchanged if no such `i` exists.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `N` and `M`, we can't determine the exact final value of `cur`. However, we can describe the final state in terms of the loop's behavior.

**Output State: **The final value of `cur` will be the smallest integer `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, if such an `i` exists and is less than the initial `cur`. If no such `i` exists, `cur` remains unchanged from its initial value.**

In simpler terms, the loop will find the smallest index `i` in `M` where the count of `i` is less than or equal to `i`, and set `cur` to that index. If no such index is found, `cur` will stay the same as it was initially.
