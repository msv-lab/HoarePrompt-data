Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `j` is 0, the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `pre[j][0]` has been increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
