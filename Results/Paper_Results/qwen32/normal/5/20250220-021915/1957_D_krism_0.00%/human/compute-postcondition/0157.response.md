Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if `t` is between 1 and 10,000, `n` is between 1 and 100,000 for each test case, and each integer `a_i` in the list `a` is between 1 and 1,000,000,000, the function computes and returns a result based on the values in `a` for each test case. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 100,000.**
