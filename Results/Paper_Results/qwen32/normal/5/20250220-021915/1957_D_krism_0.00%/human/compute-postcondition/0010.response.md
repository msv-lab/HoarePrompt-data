To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the `prefix` list is constructed in each iteration.

The loop iterates over each element `v` in the `arr` list and appends `v ^ prefix[-1]` to the `prefix` list. Here, `^` denotes the bitwise XOR operation. 

Starting with `prefix` initialized as `[0]`, the loop performs the following steps:
1. For the first element `v1` in `arr`, `prefix` becomes `[0, v1]`.
2. For the second element `v2` in `arr`, `prefix` becomes `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1]`.
3. For the third element `v3` in `arr`, `prefix` becomes `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1)]`.

Following this pattern, after processing all `n` elements in `arr`, the `prefix` list will be `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`.

The final element in the `prefix` list, `prefix[-1]`, is essentially the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, i.e., `vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)`.

The output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
- `t` remains the same as the initial state.
- `n` remains the same as the initial state.
- `a` remains the same as the initial state.
- `arr` remains the same as the initial state.
- `prefix` will be `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`.

In natural language, the final output state means that the `prefix` list will contain `n + 1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`.**
