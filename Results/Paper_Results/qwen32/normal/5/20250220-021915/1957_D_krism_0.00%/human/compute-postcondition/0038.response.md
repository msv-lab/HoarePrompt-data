The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from `n` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line
- `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`
- `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`
- `cur` is `prefix[i]`
- `suf[j][0]` is the count of how many times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0 across all iterations
- `suf[j][1]` is the count of how many times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1 across all iterations

Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`, `cur` is `prefix[i]`, `suf[j][0]` is the count of how many times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0 across all iterations, `suf[j][1]` is the count of how many times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1 across all iterations, `i` is `i - 1`**
