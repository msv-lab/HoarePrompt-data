The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. If `j` is less than 32, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 32.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `j + 1`. So, for the next iteration, `j` should be the current value of `j` plus 1, provided that it is still less than 32.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`, `cur` is `prefix[i - 1]`, `i` is `i - 1`. If the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1. `j` is `j + 1`. Specifically, if the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1; if the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 0, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.**

To adjust the state for the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`, `cur` is `prefix[i - 1]`, `i` is `i - 1`, `j` is `j + 1`. If the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.**

Since `j` has already been incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, we just need to ensure that it is still less than 32 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`, `cur` is `prefix[i - 1]`, `i` is `i - 1`, `j` is `j + 1`.**

To make it clear for the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`, `cur` is `prefix[i - 1]`, `i` is `i - 1`, `j` is `j + 1` and `j < 32`.**
