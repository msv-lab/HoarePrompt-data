The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers from the input. It then computes and prints a result based on the XOR prefix of the list and the bit distribution of the elements in the list. The function prints intermediate results including the original list, the XOR prefix list, and two 32x2 matrices `pre` and `suf`. Finally, it prints the computed result `ans` which is derived from the bit counts in `pre` and `suf`.
