The code snippet `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the value at the `j`-th index of the second sublist of `suf` by 1. Given that `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, this operation updates the count of how many times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1 across all 32 iterations.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is [0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)], `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to [1, 0], `cur` is `prefix[i]`, `i` is `i`, `suf[j][0]` is the count of how many times the j-th bit of `cur` was 0 across all 32 iterations, `suf[j][1]` is the count of how many times the j-th bit of `cur` was 1 across all 32 iterations + 1, `j` is 0, and the j-th bit of `cur` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the count of the `j`-th bit being 1 in `suf` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
