The code snippet increments the first element of the `i`-th sublist in the `pre` list by 1. Given the initial state, the `i`-th sublist in `pre` had its first element as 1, and all other elements as 0. After the operation, the first element of the `i`-th sublist in `pre` becomes 2.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, where `pre[i][0]` is 2 and all other sublists are `[0, 0]` except their first element which is 1, `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[0, 0]`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
