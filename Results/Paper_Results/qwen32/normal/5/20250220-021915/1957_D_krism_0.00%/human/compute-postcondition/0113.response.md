Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is `2 * (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `j` is 0, and the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0; `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged as described in the initial state.
