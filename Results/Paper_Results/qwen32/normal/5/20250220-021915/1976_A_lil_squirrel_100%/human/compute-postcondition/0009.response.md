The code appends the value of `ch` to the list `digits`. Therefore, `digits` will now include the new element `ch`. The values of `n`, `password`, and `ch` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is `ch_next`, `digits` includes `ch_next` as its new last element.**
