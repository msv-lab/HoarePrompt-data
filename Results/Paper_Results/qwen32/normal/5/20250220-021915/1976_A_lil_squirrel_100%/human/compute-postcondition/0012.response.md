The only object in the loop head is the variable `ch`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password` string. If there are more characters in `password` that have not been processed, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ch` is `ch_next`, which means `ch` has already taken the value of the current character being processed in the `password` string.

To execute one more time, `ch` must be updated to the next character in the `password` string. Since we do not have specific information about the current position of `ch` in the `password` string, we can only generalize that `ch` should be the next character in the sequence.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the next character in the `password` string after `ch_next`. If this next character is a digit, it will be added to the `digits` list as its new last element. Otherwise, it will be added to the `letters` list as its last element.**
