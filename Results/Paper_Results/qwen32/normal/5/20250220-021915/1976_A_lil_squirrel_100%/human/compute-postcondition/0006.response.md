The code appends the character `ch` to the `letters` list. The other variables (`n`, `password`, `digits`, and `ch`) remain unchanged. Since `ch` is not a digit, appending it to `letters` is valid according to the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing the character `ch`, `digits` is an empty list, and `ch` is not a digit.**
