The code snippet appends the character `ch` to the `digits` list. Therefore, `digits` will now include `ch` as its new last element. The value of `ch` is specified to be the next character in the `password` string after `ch_next`. If `ch` is a digit, it will be added to the `digits` list as intended by the code. The values of `n`, `password`, and `ch_next` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the next character in the `password` string after `ch_next`, `digits` list includes `ch` as its new last element.**
