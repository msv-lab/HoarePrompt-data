The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `digits`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `password`, or `letters`. Therefore, the only change in the state is the introduction of the `digits` list, which is also empty.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is an empty list, `digits` is an empty list.**
