### Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the provided code does not correctly handle the condition where a letter is followed by a digit, and provides an example of a password "a2b3" that should be invalid but is incorrectly accepted as valid by the program.

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Provided Code:
```python
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at different points:
1. **After the for loop**: `letters` contains all the letters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` contains all the digits from `password` in the order they appear.
2. **After checking if `letters` is sorted**: The program returns 'NO' if `letters` is not sorted.
3. **After checking if `digits` is sorted**: The program returns 'NO' if `digits` is not sorted.
4. **After the final for loop**: The program checks if any letter is followed by a digit and returns 'NO' if it finds one. If no such condition is found, it returns 'YES'.

#### Analysis:
- The code checks if the letters in the password are sorted.
- The code checks if the digits in the password are sorted.
- The code ensures that no digit follows a letter by iterating through the password and checking each character and the next one.

The example provided in the original assessment, "a2b3", is indeed handled correctly by the code:
- `letters` becomes `['a', 'b']` and `digits` becomes `['2', '3']`.
- Both `letters` and `digits` are sorted.
- The loop checks each character and finds that 'a' is followed by '2', which is a digit. Therefore, the program correctly returns 'NO'.

Thus, the original assessment's claim that the program incorrectly accepts "a2b3" is incorrect. The program correctly identifies that "a2b3" does not satisfy the condition that no digit should come after a letter.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
