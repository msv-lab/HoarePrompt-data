Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear. Additionally, the list `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and the list `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(password) - 1):
    if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, sorted in non-decreasing order, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear, sorted in non-decreasing order. Additionally, for any index `i` where `0 <= i < n-1`, it is not the case that `password[i]` is a lowercase Latin letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, sorted in non-decreasing order, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear, sorted in non-decreasing order. Additionally, for any index `i` where `0 <= i < n-1`, it is not the case that `password[i]` is a lowercase Latin letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, except when `i` is 4. If `password[i].isalpha()` and `password[i + 1].isdigit()` for `i = 4`, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, sorted in non-decreasing order, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear, sorted in non-decreasing order. Additionally, for any index `i` where `0 <= i < n-1`, it is not the case that `password[i]` is a lowercase Latin letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, except when `i` is 4. If `password[i].isalpha()` and `password[i + 1].isdigit()` for `i = 4`, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'NO'. `i` is `len(password) - 1`. If `password[i].isalpha()` and `password[i + 1].isdigit()` for `i = 4`, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'NO' and continues with the subsequent code.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
