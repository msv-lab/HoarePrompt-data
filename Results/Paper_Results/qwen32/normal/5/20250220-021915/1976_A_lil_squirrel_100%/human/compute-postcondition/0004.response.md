The code appends the digit `ch` to the list `digits`. The values of `n`, `password`, and `letters` remain unchanged. The list `digits` now contains the single element `ch`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is an empty list, `digits` is a list containing the digit `ch`, and `ch` is a digit.**
