Postcondition: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `sub_summ` is updated to its previous value plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` remains unchanged.**
