To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each tuple in `main_ar`. The loop iterates over each tuple in `main_ar`, and if the sum of the two integers in the tuple is greater than or equal to 0, it adds this sum to `sub_summ`.

Let's summarize the steps for the full loop execution:

1. Start with the initial state: `main_ar` is a list of tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, and `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.
2. For each tuple `val_b` in `main_ar`, check if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.
3. If the condition is true, add `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ`.
4. Continue this process for all tuples in `main_ar`.

Let's assume the initial state:
- `main_ar = [(a1, b1), (a2, b2), (a3, b3), ..., (an, bn)]`
- `sec_arr = [(c1, d1), (c2, d2), ..., (cm, dm)]`
- `sub_summ = c1 + c2 + ... + cm`

After all iterations, `sub_summ` will be updated by adding the sum of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for each tuple `val_b` in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.

The final `sub_summ` will be:
\[ \text{sub\_summ} = c1 + c2 + ... + cm + \sum_{\text{for each } (a_i, b_i) \text{ in } main\_ar \text{ where } a_i + b_i \geq 0} (a_i + b_i) \]

So, the final output state is:

Output State: **sub_summ is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in sec_arr plus the sum of (a_i + b_i) for each tuple (a_i, b_i) in main_ar where (a_i + b_i) >= 0.**

In simpler terms, `sub_summ` will include the initial sum of the first elements of `sec_arr` and the sum of the elements of each tuple in `main_ar` where the sum of the tuple's elements is non-negative.
