The code snippet increments `sub_summ` by the first element of the tuple `val_a`, which is the second tuple in `sec_arr`. Given that `sub_summ` was initially set to the first element of the first tuple in `sec_arr`, after the operation, `sub_summ` will be the sum of the first elements of the first and second tuples in `sec_arr`.

Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the prices (a_i, b_i) for Alice and Bob respectively for a particular item; `sec_arr` must have at least two tuples; `sub_summ` is `val_a[0] + val_a[0]` where `val_a` is the second tuple in `sec_arr`.** 

In simpler terms, `sub_summ` is now the sum of the first elements of the first two tuples in `sec_arr`.
