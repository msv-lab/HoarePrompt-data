Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary where keys are player identifiers (strings) and values are their current positions on the field (pairs of integers), and `blud` is a pair of integers representing the current position of the Bludger on the field; `out` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for p in player:
    if player[p] == blud:
        out.append(p)
        player[p] = [-1, -1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where keys are player identifiers (strings) and values are their current positions on the field (pairs of integers). If the position of the player identified by `p` was equal to `blud`, then the position of the player identified by `p` is now `[-1, -1]` and `out` is a list containing the player identifier `p`. Otherwise, the position of the player identified by `p` remains unchanged and `out` is still an empty list. `blud` is a pair of integers representing the current position of the Bludger on the field.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the player identifier `p`. If `player[p]` was equal to `blud`, then the value of `player[p]` is updated to `[-1, -1]` (other key-value pairs remain unchanged), and `out` is a list containing the player identifier `p`. Otherwise, `player` remains unchanged, and `out` is still an empty list. `blud` is a pair of integers representing the current position of the Bludger on the field, and `p` is the next player identifier in the `player` dictionary.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `blud` is a pair of integers representing the current position of the Bludger on the field, `p` is the next player identifier in the `player` dictionary after the previous `p`. If `player[p]` equals `blud`, then the value for key `p` in `player` is updated to `[-1, -1]` and `out` is a list that includes the player identifier `p`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `player` or `out`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
