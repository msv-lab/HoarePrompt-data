The only object in the loop head is the variable `p`, which iterates over the sorted `out` list. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `p` to the next smallest element in the sorted `out` list.

Given:
- `t` is 0
- `player` is {'Alice': [1, 2], 'Bob': [-1, -1], 'Charlie': [5, 6]}
- `blud` is [3, 4]
- `out` is a list that must have at least two elements
- `p` is the next smallest element in the sorted `out` list

At the end of the previous iteration, `p` was the smallest element in the sorted `out` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be updated to the next smallest element in the sorted `out` list.

State: **`t` is 0, `player` is {'Alice': [1, 2], 'Bob': [-1, -1], 'Charlie': [5, 6]}, `blud` is [3, 4], `out` is a list that must have at least two elements, `p` is the second smallest element in the sorted `out` list**
