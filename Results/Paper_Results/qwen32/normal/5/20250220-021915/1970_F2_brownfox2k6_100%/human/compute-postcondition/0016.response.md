Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is 0.
2. `player` is a dictionary with keys 'Alice', 'Bob', and 'Charlie', and their respective values are lists `[1, 2]`, `[-1, -1]`, and `[5, 6]`.
3. `blud` is a list `[3, 4]`.
4. `out` is a list that must have at least one element.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
```

### Analysis:
- `t` is explicitly given as 0.
- `p` is not defined in the initial state. This means that the code will raise a `NameError` because `p` is not recognized as a variable in the current scope.
- `'ELIMINATED'` is a string literal.

### Conclusion:
Since `p` is not defined, the code will not execute successfully and will raise a `NameError`. However, based on the task requirements, we need to describe the intended output based on the given information. Since `p` is undefined, we cannot determine what it would print and must indicate that there is an error.

But if we were to strictly adhere to the format and assume the intention was to print `t` and another variable (possibly `player` or `blud`), we would need more context. Given the current state, we can only describe the known values and the error.

### Output:
Since `p` is undefined, the code will raise a `NameError`. However, if we consider only the known values and the string literal, and assume the intention was to print `t` and another variable, we can describe it as follows:

Output: **0, p, ELIMINATED (where p is not defined and will raise a NameError)**

To strictly adhere to the format and the given information:

Output: **0, p, ELIMINATED (where p is not defined and will raise a NameError)**
