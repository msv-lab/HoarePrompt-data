### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program code. Here is a detailed breakdown of the reasoning behind the assessment:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are only responsible for moving an object (likely a player or the Bludger) and checking for eliminations, respectively. They do not cover the full range of actions specified in the problem description, such as catching and throwing the Quaffle, checking for goals, or updating the score.

2. **Missing Data Structures**:
   - The code does not define or initialize necessary data structures to keep track of the positions of players, the Quaffle, the Bludger, and the goals. These data structures are essential for accurately simulating the game and determining the outcome of each action.

3. **No Main Game Loop**:
   - There is no main loop in the provided code to process each action step-by-step, update the game state, and print the required events. Without such a loop, the program cannot handle the sequence of actions described in the input.

4. **No Score Tracking**:
   - The code does not include any mechanism to track and print the final score. It only addresses eliminations, which is only one aspect of the game.

5. **No Handling of Invalid States**:
   - The code does not handle cases where a player might be in an invalid state, such as carrying the Quaffle when they shouldn't. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the game.

6. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary for `func_2` is accurate and describes its behavior correctly. However, it does not negate the fact that the function alone is insufficient to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code snippets are incomplete and do not address all the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is not correct as it stands.

### Final: **False**
