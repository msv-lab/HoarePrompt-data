Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not handle the entire problem description. Here are some issues:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The provided code snippets `func_1` and `func_2` do not cover the full functionality required by the problem description. For example, there are no functions to handle catching and throwing the Quaffle, checking for goals, or updating the score.

2. **Missing Data Structures**: The code does not define or initialize the necessary data structures to keep track of the positions of players, the Quaffle, the Bludger, and the goals. These are crucial for determining the outcome of each action.

3. **No Main Game Loop**: The code does not include a main loop to process each action step-by-step, update the game state, and print the required events.

4. **No Score Tracking**: The code does not include any mechanism to track and print the final score.

5. **No Handling of Invalid States**: The code does not handle cases where a player might be in an invalid state (e.g., carrying the Quaffle when they shouldn't).

Here is a brief outline of what the complete code should include:
- Parsing the input to initialize the field, players, Quaffle, Bludger, and goals.
- A main loop to process each action.
- Functions to handle movement, catching, throwing, and scoring.
- Functions to check for collisions with the Bludger.
- Keeping track of the score and printing the final score.

Since the provided code does not meet these requirements, it is incorrect.
