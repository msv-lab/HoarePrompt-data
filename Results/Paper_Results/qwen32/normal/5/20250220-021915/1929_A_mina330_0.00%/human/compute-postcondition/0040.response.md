Output State: **`ntest` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `ntest` ≤ 500, `itest` is `ntest - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop are completed:
- `ntest` remains the same, representing the total number of test cases.
- `itest` will be equal to `ntest - 1`, indicating that the last test case has been processed.
- For each test case, `n` is the number of integers in the array `a`.
- `a` is sorted in ascending order.
- `kq` is calculated as the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, for the first half of the sorted array.
- `i` will be equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1` at the end of the inner loop, which processes the first half of the array.
