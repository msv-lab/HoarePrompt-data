### Reasoning:

The goal of the program is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array. The provided program sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, up to the middle of the list.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Sorting the Array:** The program sorts the array in ascending order. This is a key step because the maximum beauty can be achieved by maximizing the differences between consecutive elements. In a sorted array, the largest differences are between the smallest and largest elements, the second smallest and second largest elements, and so on.

2. **Calculating the Beauty:** The program calculates the sum of differences between pairs of elements from the two ends of the sorted array moving towards the center. This approach ensures that the maximum possible differences are considered, thereby maximizing the beauty of the array.

3. **Execution Summary:** The execution summary describes the program's behavior accurately. It processes each test case by sorting the array and computing the beauty as the sum of the differences between paired elements from the ends of the sorted array.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **First Example:**
  - Input: `3, 2 1 3`
  - Sorted: `1 2 3`
  - Differences: `(3 - 1) + (2 - 2) = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Second Example:**
  - Input: `3, 69 69 69`
  - Sorted: `69 69 69`
  - Differences: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0`
  - Output: `0`

- **Third Example:**
  - Input: `5, 100 54 80 43 90`
  - Sorted: `43 54 80 90 100`
  - Differences: `(100 - 43) + (90 - 54) = 57`
  - Output: `57`

- **Fourth Example:**
  - Input: `4, 3 4 3 3`
  - Sorted: `3 3 3 4`
  - Differences: `(4 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1`
  - Output: `1`

- **Fifth Example:**
  - Input: `2, 2 1`
  - Sorted: `1 2`
  - Differences: `(2 - 1) = 1`
  - Output: `1`

All the outputs match the expected results as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and summing the differences between paired elements from the ends towards the center. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
