You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list and calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, up to the middle of the list. The result for each test case is printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Rearrange elements of the array to maximize the beauty of the array.
- **Beauty Calculation**: Beauty is calculated as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.
- **Input**:
  - First line: Number of test cases (t).
  - For each test case:
    - First line: Length of the array (n).
    - Second line: n integers representing the elements of the array.
- **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum beauty of the array.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)
```

### Analysis:
The program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on. This approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}). This can be achieved by arranging the elements in an alternating pattern of maximum and minimum values. For example, if the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the optimal arrangement could be `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]` to maximize the differences.

### Example:
Consider the array `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`:
- Beauty = (5 - 1) + (2 - 5) + (4 - 2) + (3 - 4) = 4 - 3 + 2 - 1 = 2

The provided code would sort the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and then calculate:
- Beauty = (5 - 1) + (4 - 2) = 4 + 2 = 6

Clearly, the provided code does not produce the maximum beauty in this case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not always produce the maximum beauty of the array for every potential case. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:
The provided program sorts the array and calculates the beauty by taking the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on. This approach does not maximize the beauty of the array in all cases. A correct approach would involve arranging the elements in an alternating pattern of maximum and minimum values to maximize the differences.
