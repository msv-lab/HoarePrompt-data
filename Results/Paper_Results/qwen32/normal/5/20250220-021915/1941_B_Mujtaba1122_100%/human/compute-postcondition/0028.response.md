The code modifies the element at index `i + 1` in the `list` by subtracting the value of the element at index `i - 1` from it. Given `i` is `1`, `list[i + 1]` refers to the element at index `2` and `list[i - 1]` refers to the element at index `0`. 

The value of `list[0]` is `1`, and the value of `list[2]` is `1`. The operation `list[2] -= 1 * list[0]` translates to `list[2] = list[2] - list[0]`, which results in `list[2] = 1 - 1 = 0`.

The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `4` is still valid.

Output State: **`list` is `[1, 2, 0]`, `i` is `1`, `n` must be greater than `4`**.
