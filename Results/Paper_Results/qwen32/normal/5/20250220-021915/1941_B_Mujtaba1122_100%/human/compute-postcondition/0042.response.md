The code modifies the `list` by subtracting `1 * list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `2`, so `list[i - 1]` is `list[1]` which is `1`, and `list[i + 1]` is `list[3]` which is `1`. The operation `list[3] -= 1 * list[1]` translates to `list[3] -= 1`, changing `list[3]` from `1` to `0`.

Output State: **`list` is `[0, 1, 2, 0]`, `i` is `2`, `n` is greater than `4`**.
