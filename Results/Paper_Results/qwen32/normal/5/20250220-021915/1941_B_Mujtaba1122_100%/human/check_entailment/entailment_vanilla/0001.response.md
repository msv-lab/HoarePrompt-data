Let's analyze the given program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine whether we can make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation multiple times. The operation involves selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and modifying \(a_{i-1}\), \(a_i\), and \(a_{i+1}\) as follows:
- \(a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1\)
- \(a_i = a_i - 2\)
- \(a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1\)

The operation can be applied any number of times, and any index \(i\) can be used zero or more times.

### Program Analysis
The given program consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(list, n)**: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
2. **func_2(list, n)**: This function attempts to perform the described operation to make all elements zero.

#### func_1(list, n)
This function is straightforward. It iterates through the list and returns `False` if it finds any non-zero element. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

#### func_2(list, n)
This function is intended to perform the operations described in the problem but contains several issues:
- **Incorrect operation logic**: The while loop condition and the operations inside the loop are incorrect. The operation should reduce \(a_{i-1}\), \(a_i\), and \(a_{i+1}\) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the current implementation incorrectly multiplies these values by `list[i - 1]`.
- **Early termination**: The function prints 'no' and returns immediately if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the loop for a particular \(i\). This is incorrect because the operation can be applied to other indices as well.
- **Output handling**: The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' directly, which is not suitable for handling multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be made zero using the described operations.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
