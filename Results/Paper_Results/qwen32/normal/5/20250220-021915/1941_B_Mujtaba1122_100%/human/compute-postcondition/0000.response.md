To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop head:

```
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range `(1, n - 1)` contains at least one integer. This means that `n - 1` must be greater than `1`, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than `2`.

Given the initial state:
- `list` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `n` is an integer such that `n >= 3` and `n` is equal to the length of `list`.

The current state already satisfies the condition `n >= 3`, which means `n - 1` will be at least `2`, and the range `(1, n - 1)` will contain at least one integer (`1`), ensuring the loop can execute.

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `n`), and `n` already meets the requirement, the only variable we need to consider is `i`. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be initialized because it is controlled by the `range` function in the loop head.

Therefore, no further adjustments are needed for `i` or `n` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers, and `n` is an integer such that `n >= 3` and `n` is equal to the length of `list`. `i` is not yet initialized.**
