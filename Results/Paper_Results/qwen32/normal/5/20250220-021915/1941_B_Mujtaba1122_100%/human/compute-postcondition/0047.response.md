The code modifies the value at index `i` of the list by subtracting twice the value at index `i - 1` from it. Given that `i` is `2`, the value at index `2` is `2` and the value at index `1` is `1`. The operation `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` translates to `list[2] -= 2 * list[1]`, which is `2 -= 2 * 1`, resulting in `list[2]` being `0`. The other variables and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list` is `[0, 1, 0, 0]`, `i` is `2`, `n` is greater than `4`**
