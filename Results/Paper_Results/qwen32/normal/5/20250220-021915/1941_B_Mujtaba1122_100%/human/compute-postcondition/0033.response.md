The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('no')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'no'`. The initial state provides information about the list, indices, and a condition involving `n`, but none of these variables or conditions affect the output of the `print` statement. The string `'no'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **no**
