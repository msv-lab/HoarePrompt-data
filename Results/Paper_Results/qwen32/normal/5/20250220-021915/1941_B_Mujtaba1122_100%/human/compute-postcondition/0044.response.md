The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the element at index `i - 1` of the list. Given that `i` is `2`, the element at index `1` (which is `1` in the initial state) is modified. Specifically, the value at `list[1]` is reduced by its own value, effectively setting it to `0`.

Thus, the list `[0, 1, 0, 0]` becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `i` is `2`, `n` is greater than `4`**.
