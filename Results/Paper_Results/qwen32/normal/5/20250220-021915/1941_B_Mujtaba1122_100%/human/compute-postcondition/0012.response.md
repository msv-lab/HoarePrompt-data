The code snippet `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the element at index `i - 1` of the list. Given `i` is 1, the element at index `0` of the list is modified. The operation `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is equivalent to `list[0] -= 1 * list[0]`, which means the first element of the list is set to 0 (since any number minus itself is zero).

The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The list is updated to `[0, -1, 0]`.

Output State: **`list` is [0, -1, 0], `n` is 3, `i` is 1**.
