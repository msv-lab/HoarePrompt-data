The code snippet modifies the value at index `i + 1` of the list by subtracting 1 times the value at index `i - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so it modifies the value at index 2 (`list[2]`) by subtracting 1 times the value at index 0 (`list[0]`).

Initial values:
- `list` is [1, 2, 1]
- `n` is 3
- `i` is 1

Calculation:
- `list[i + 1]` is `list[2]` which is 1.
- `list[i - 1]` is `list[0]` which is 1.
- The operation performed is `list[2] -= 1 * list[0]`, so `list[2]` becomes `1 - 1 * 1` which is `0`.

Thus, the updated list is [1, 2, 0].

Output State: **`list` is [1, 2, 0], `n` is 3, `i` is 1**.
