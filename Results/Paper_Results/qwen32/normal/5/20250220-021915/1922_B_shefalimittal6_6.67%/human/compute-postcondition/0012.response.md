The code snippet provided initializes the variable `res` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`) are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `res` has been initialized to 0 while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `nums` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `res` is 0.**
