The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` calculates the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time and adds it to `res`. Given that `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `math.comb(cnt, 3)` will compute a specific integer value based on the formula for combinations.

Output State: **`res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**

In simpler terms, the value of `res` is updated by adding the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.
