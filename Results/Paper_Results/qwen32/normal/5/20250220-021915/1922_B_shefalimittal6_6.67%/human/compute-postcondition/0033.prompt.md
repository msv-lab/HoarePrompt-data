Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `nums` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `res` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, then `res` is set to `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. If `cnt` is exactly 2, `res` is set to `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that is equal to `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer, `cnt` is `cnt_next`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is further increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` excluding those equal to `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is further increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
