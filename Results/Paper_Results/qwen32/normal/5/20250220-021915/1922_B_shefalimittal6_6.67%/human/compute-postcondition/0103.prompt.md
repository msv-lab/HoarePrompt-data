Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    num_of_lens = {}
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for x in nums:
        num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
    res = 0
    for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
        if cnt >= 3:
            res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
        if cnt >= 2:
            total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
            res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: res

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: res is the cumulative sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt >= 3` and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt >= 2` where `total_sum` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nums` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state, `res` is the total number of valid combinations calculated based on the counts in `num_of_lens`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
