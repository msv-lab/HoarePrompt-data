The only variable in the loop head of the given for loop is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute if `t` is greater than or equal to 1. Since the problem specifies that `t` is within this range, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `_` is a conventional throwaway variable used in loops where the loop variable is not needed, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
