Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

In natural language: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an input integer, which is within the range from 1 to 10,000. The other variables (`n` and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) and their constraints remain unchanged.
