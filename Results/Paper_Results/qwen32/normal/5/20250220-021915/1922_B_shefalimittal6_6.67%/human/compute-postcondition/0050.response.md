Postcondition: **`res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, and `nums` is a list of integers from the input.**
