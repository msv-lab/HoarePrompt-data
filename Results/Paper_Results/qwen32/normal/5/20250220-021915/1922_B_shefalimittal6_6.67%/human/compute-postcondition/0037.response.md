The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary named `num_of_lens`. This action does not affect the values of `res`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, the values of `res` and `n` remain unchanged, and `t` retains its value from the previous iteration, which is described as being one less than its value at the end of that iteration.

Output State: **`res` (unchanged), `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary**.
