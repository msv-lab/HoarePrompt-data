The given code snippet increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. If `x` is not already a key in `num_of_lens`, it will be added with a count of 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, and the other elements in `num_of_lens` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the count of `x` is incremented by 1; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `x` is the next element in `nums`. The count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is incremented by 1.**
