The code snippet provided calculates the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time using `math.comb(cnt, 3)` and adds this value to `res`. Given that `res` was initially 0, `res` will now hold the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged after the execution of this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**
