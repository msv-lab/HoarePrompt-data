Output State: **`res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` again if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers from the input; `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt` value.**

In simple terms, the value of `res` has been updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
