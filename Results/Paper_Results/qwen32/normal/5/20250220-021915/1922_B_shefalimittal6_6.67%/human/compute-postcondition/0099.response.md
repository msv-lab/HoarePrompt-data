The code snippet modifies the value of `res` by adding the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum` to it. No other variables are changed by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. The values of `nums`, `num_of_lens`, `t`, `n`, `cnt`, and `total_sum` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state, `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the new `cnt`.**
