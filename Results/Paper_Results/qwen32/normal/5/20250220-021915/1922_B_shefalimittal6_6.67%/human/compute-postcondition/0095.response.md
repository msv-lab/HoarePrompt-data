The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `cnt` to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a list of integers.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`.
- `t` remains in its initial state.
- `n` remains in its initial state.
- `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is at least 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged.
- `cnt` is the current value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for `cnt`.

To proceed to the next iteration, `cnt` needs to be updated to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums`, `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state, `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is at least 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the new `cnt`.**
