The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums`. If there are more elements in `nums` after the current `x`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the next element in `nums`, and `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration. The variable `res` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `num_of_lens` has its count for the key `x` incremented by 1, and `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least one more element after the current `x`. The next `x` will be the next element in `nums`.

State: **`res` (unchanged), `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer (unchanged), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the count for the key `x` incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers from the input and must have at least two elements, `x` is the next element in `nums`**
