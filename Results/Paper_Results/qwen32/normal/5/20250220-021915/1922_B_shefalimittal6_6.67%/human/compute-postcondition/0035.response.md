The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use) and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. Specifically, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, and `_` will take on the values from 0 to `t-1` in successive iterations.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` must have been greater than 0, and `_` would have taken on the value `t-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop condition, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`. After the last iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1 internally by the loop mechanism, so for the loop to execute again, `t` should be the value it was at the start of the previous iteration minus 1.

However, since the loop control variable `_` is not relevant to maintaining the loop's condition, we don't need to adjust its state. The state of `t` should be adjusted to reflect that one iteration has completed, so `t` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is `res` (which does not affect the loop condition), we only need to adjust `t`.

State: **`res` (unchanged), `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration**. 

If we assume the value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration was `x`, then at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `x-1`.

State: **`res` (unchanged), `t` is `x-1` where `x` is the value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't have the specific value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize:

State: **`res` (unchanged), `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
