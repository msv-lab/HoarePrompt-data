#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    cats_to_add = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1')
    cats_to_remove = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0')
    return max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)
    #The program returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2`, each of length `n` and consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It calculates and returns the maximum count between the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1' and the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0'.
