Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), representing half the number of integers on a whiteboard. This is followed by a line containing `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. The function returns the results for each test case.**
