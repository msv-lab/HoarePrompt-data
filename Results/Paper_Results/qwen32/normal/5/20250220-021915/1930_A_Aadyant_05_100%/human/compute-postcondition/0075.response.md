The only variable in the loop head is `fin`, which is the loop variable that takes on the value of each element in the list `final` during each iteration. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `final` and how `fin` is being updated.

Given:
- `final` is a list containing at least one element.

At the end of the previous iteration, `fin` would have taken the value of the last element that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `final` must still have elements left to process.

Since the loop variable `fin` is updated to the next element in the list `final` during each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `fin` will be the next element in the list after the one that was just processed.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `final` remains a list containing at least one element (since the previous iteration processed one element, there must be at least one element left for the loop to execute again).
- `fin` will be the next element in the list `final`.

State: **`final` is a list containing at least one element, `fin` is the next element in the list `final`**
