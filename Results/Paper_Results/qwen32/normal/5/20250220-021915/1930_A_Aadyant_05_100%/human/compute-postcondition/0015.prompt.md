Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is the input string provided by the user, `list1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `b` on whitespace, `b` is an input string provided by the user.
Code of the loop:
for str in list1:
    list2.append(int(str))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `str`, `a` is the input string provided by the user, `b` is an input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `b` on whitespace and must have at least one element, `str` is the first element of `list1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `str` (appended), `a` is the input string provided by the user, `b` is an input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `b` on whitespace and must have at least two elements, `str` is the second element of `list1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer values of `str` (appended twice), `a` is the input string provided by the user, `b` is an input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `b` on whitespace and must have at least three elements, `str` is the third element of `list1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
