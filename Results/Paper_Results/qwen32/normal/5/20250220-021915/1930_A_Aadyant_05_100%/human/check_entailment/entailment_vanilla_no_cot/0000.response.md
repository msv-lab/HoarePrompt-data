Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Input Handling**: The program expects the number of test cases on the first line and then for each test case, it expects three lines of input: `n`, an empty line, and then the list of numbers. However, the problem description specifies that for each test case, there should be two lines of input: `n` and the list of numbers. The program should not be expecting an empty line between `n` and the list of numbers.

2. **Looping Over Test Cases**: The program loops over the number of test cases `n` times when it should loop over the number of test cases `t` times. The variable `n` is the number of pairs of integers in each test case, not the number of test cases.

3. **Reading Input for Each Test Case**: The program incorrectly reads input for each test case. It should read `n` and then the list of numbers in one go, but it currently reads `n` and then seems to expect some input (which is not described in the problem statement) before reading the list of numbers.

4. **Sorting and Summing**: The logic for sorting and summing the numbers is correct, but it is wrapped in an incorrect loop and input handling structure.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Number of test cases
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())  # Number of pairs
        list2 = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read and convert the list of numbers
        list2.sort()
        s = sum(list2[i] for i in range(0, 2*n, 2))  # Sum the minimum of each pair
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the input and performs the required operations to find the maximum score for each test case.
