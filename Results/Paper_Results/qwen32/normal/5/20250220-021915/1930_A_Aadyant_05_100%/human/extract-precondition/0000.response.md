Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), representing half the number of integers on the whiteboard. This is followed by a line containing 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. The total number of test cases, t, is between 1 and 5000.**
