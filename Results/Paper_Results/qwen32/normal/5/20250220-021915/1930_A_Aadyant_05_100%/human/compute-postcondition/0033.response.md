The code snippet appends the integer value of the string `str` to the list `list2`. The value of `str` is converted to an integer and added to the end of `list2`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is a list containing `s`, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `str`, `a` is the new input string provided by the user, `b` is the new input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of words from `b` that must contain at least one element, `i` is the last even index that is less than the length of `list2`, `num` is incremented by 1**.
