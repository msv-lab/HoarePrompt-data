The code snippet `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of words based on whitespace and assigns this list to `list1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is a list containing `s`, `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is the new input string provided by the user, `b` is the new input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of words from `b`, `str` is the last element of `list1` that was processed by the loop, `i` is the last even index that is less than the length of `list2`, `num` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The variable `list1` now contains the words from the string `b` split by whitespace. All other variables retain their initial values.
