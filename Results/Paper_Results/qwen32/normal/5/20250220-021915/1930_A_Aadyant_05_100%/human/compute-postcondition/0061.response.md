To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand that the loop iterates over each word in `list1`, converts it to an integer, and appends it to `list2`. The loop doesn't modify `s`, `n`, `t`, `final`, `num`, `a`, or `b` in its body, except for appending to `list2`.

Given that `str` is the loop variable representing each word in `list1`, and `list2` accumulates the integer values of these words, after all iterations, `list2` will contain all the integer values of the words in `list1`.

Here's the output state after all iterations:

Output State: **`s` is 0; `n`, `t`, `final`, `num`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged; `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all words in `list1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has gone through every word in the input string `b` (which is split into words in `list1`), `list2` will hold all those words converted to integers. All other variables retain their initial values except for `list2`, which is fully populated with integers.
