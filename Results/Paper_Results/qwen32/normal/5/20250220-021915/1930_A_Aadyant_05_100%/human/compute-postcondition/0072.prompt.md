Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input string representing half the number of integers on the whiteboard; `t` is between 1 and 5000; `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for num in range(int(n)):
    s = 0
    list2 = []
    a = input()
    list1 = []
    b = input()
    list1 = b.split()
    for str in list1:
        list2.append(int(str))
    list2.sort()
    for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
        s = s + int(list2[i])
    final.append(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is a list containing `s`, `s` is the sum of all elements at even indices in `list2`, `list2` is a sorted list of integer values obtained from `list1`, `a` is the input string provided by the user, `b` is an input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `b` on whitespace, `str` is the last element of `list1` that was processed by the loop, `i` is the last even index that is less than the length of `list2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is updated to the sum of integers at all even indices of `list2`; `n`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `list1`, and `str` remain unchanged; `final` includes the value of `s` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is the sum of elements at even indices in `list2`; `n`, `t`, `num`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged; `list2` is a sorted list of integer values of all words in `list1`; `final` has `s` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
