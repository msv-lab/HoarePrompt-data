Output State: **`tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is an input value; `b` is an input value; `c` is an iterable with at least two elements; `no` is False; `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`; `counter` is 2; `x` is the third element in `c` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
