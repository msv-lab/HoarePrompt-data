Postcondition: **`tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is the new input value; `b` is the new input value; `c` is the new input value from `input()` and must be an iterable with at least two elements; `i` is the current iteration index + 2; `counter` is 2; `x` is the next element in `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.**
