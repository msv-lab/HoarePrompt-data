Postcondition: **`tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is an input value; `b` is an input value; `c` is an iterable with at least one element; `no` is True; `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`; `counter` is 0; `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`.**
