The given code attempts to decode a list of strings using a character map. However, there is a mistake in the code: `encoded` is a list of strings, and the code tries to iterate over it as if it were a single string. This will result in an error because `char_map[ch]` will fail when `ch` is a string (which happens when iterating directly over `encoded`).

Assuming the intention was to decode each string in the `encoded` list individually and then join the results, the corrected code would look something like this:

```python
decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for s in encoded for ch in s)
```

But since the provided code is incorrect and would raise an error, I'll describe the output state based on the provided code, acknowledging the error.

Output State: **The code will raise a TypeError because it tries to use a string as a key in `char_map` when iterating over `encoded` directly. `encoded` is a list of strings, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters, `char_map` is a dictionary mapping each character to its reverse counterpart, `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`, and `i` is equal to `len_unique`.**

In natural language: The code will produce an error because it attempts to use each string in the `encoded` list as a key in the `char_map` dictionary, which is not valid. The variables `encoded`, `unique_chars`, `char_map`, `len_unique`, and `i` remain unchanged.
