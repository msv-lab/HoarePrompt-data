### Reasoning:
Let's break down the given problem and the provided program to see if it correctly performs the decoding process as described.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to decode a string `b` that was encoded using a specific algorithm.
   - The algorithm involves creating an auxiliary string `r` consisting of all distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character from `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - To decode, we need to reverse the mapping process.
   - From the encoded string `b`, we can identify the unique characters and sort them to form `r`.
   - We then create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - Using this mapping, we replace each character in `b` with its corresponding original character to get `s`.

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program starts by reading input and parsing it into the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the string `b` itself.
   - The function `func_1` is called to decode the string `b`.
   - Inside `func_1`, the unique characters of `b` are extracted and sorted to form `r`.
   - A dictionary `char_map` is created to map each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - The encoded string `b` is then decoded by replacing each character using the `char_map`.
   - The decoded string is returned and printed for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the unique characters and sorts them.
   - It accurately creates the symmetric mapping for decoding.
   - The decoding process is correctly implemented by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding original character using the `char_map`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. It handles multiple test cases and processes each encoded string `b` to produce the correct original string `s`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
