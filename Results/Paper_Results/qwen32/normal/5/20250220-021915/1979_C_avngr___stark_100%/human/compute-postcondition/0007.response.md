To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the function `func_1`. The loop iterates over the list `numbers` starting from the second element, updating `result` by applying `func_1` to the current `result` and the current element of `numbers`.

Here's the loop again for clarity:
```python
for num in numbers[1:]:
    result = func_1(result, num)
```

Given the initial state:
- `numbers` is a list of integers.
- `result` is initialized to the first element of `numbers`.

After each iteration, `result` is updated by applying `func_1` to the current `result` and the current element in `numbers`.

The loop will execute for `len(numbers) - 1` times, as it starts from the second element and goes to the end of the list.

The output state after all iterations will be:
- `numbers` remains the same list of integers.
- `result` will be the final value after applying `func_1` iteratively to all elements of `numbers` starting from the first element.

In natural language: The output state after the loop has finished executing is that `numbers` remains unchanged, and `result` is the final value obtained by applying `func_1` cumulatively to all elements of `numbers` starting from the first element.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers; `result` is the final value obtained by cumulatively applying `func_1` to all elements of `numbers` starting from the first element.**
