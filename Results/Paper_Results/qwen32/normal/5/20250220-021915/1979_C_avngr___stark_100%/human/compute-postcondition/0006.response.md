Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `result` is the output of `func_1(result, num)`; `num` is the next element in `numbers` after the current `num`**

Explanation: The value of `result` is updated to be the output of `func_1(result, num)`. The variable `num` is updated to the next element in the list `numbers`. The list `numbers` and its properties remain unchanged.
