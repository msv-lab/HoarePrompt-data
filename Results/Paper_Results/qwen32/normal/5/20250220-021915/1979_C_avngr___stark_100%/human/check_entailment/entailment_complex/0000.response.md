### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented by the functions `func_1` and `func_2` and the main logic of the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received if any one of the outcomes wins.
- The amount received for winning the `i-th` outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by `k_i`.
- The program must output a valid distribution of bets or `-1` if no such distribution exists.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.
   - The formula used `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)` is correct for calculating the LCM.

2. **Function `func_2(numbers)`**:
   - This function calculates the LCM of a list of integers.
   - It cumulatively applies the `func_1` function to all elements of the list.
   - The LCM of a list of numbers is the smallest number that is divisible by all the numbers in the list.
   - The implementation is correct.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case:
     - The program reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.
     - It calculates the LCM of all the multipliers `k` using `func_2`.
     - It then calculates the bets `c[i]` as `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM.
     - It checks if the sum of the bets is less than `m`. If not, it prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

#### Verification:
- The key idea here is that if we bet `m // k[i]` on the `i-th` outcome, where `m` is the LCM of all `k_i`, then for any winning outcome `i`, the amount received is `k_i * (m // k_i) = m`, which is greater than the total bet `sum(m // k[i])`.
- Since `m` is the LCM of all `k_i`, it is divisible by each `k_i`, ensuring that `m // k[i]` is an integer.
- The sum of `m // k[i]` is strictly less than `m` if `n > 1` because `m` is the smallest number divisible by all `k_i`, and thus `m // k[i]` will be less than `m` for each `i`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets or to identify if no such bets exist. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented to calculate the LCM, which is essential for the solution.

**Correctness: True**
