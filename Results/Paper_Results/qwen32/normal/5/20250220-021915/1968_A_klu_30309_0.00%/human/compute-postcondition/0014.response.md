The only variable in the loop head is `y`. According to the code, the loop variable `y` starts from `x - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 2. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is `y_end - 1`, which means the current value of `y` is `y_end - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `y_end - 2`.

The states of `x` and `max_val` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not depend on the loop variable `y` directly for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`x` is an integer such that `3 <= x <= 1000`, `y` is `y_end - 2`, `y_end` is the value of `y` at the end of the previous iteration. If `x % y == 0`, then `max_val` is set to `y`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.**
