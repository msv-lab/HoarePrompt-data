The provided code snippet is a function definition and does not contain any executable code that would alter the initial state of the variable `x`. The function is intended to find the value of `y` that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y`, but since the function body is not provided, no changes are made to the initial state of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.**
