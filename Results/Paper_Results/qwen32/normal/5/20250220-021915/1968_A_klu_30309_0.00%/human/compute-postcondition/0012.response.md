The value of `max_val` is assigned the value of `y`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. The condition `2 * y >= x` is not evaluated in this snippet, and no return occurs based on the provided code. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `max_val`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that `3 <= x <= 1000`, `y` is `y_end - 1` where `y_end` is the value of `y` at the end of the previous iteration, `max_val` is `y`.**
