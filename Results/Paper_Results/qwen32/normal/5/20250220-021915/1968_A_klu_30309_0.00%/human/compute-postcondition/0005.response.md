Given the constraints and the provided code, we need to determine the value of `y` that satisfies the conditions:

1. `3 <= x <= 1000`
2. `max_val` is 1 (this variable does not affect the return value directly)
3. `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`)
4. `2 * y >= x`

The code returns the value of `y`. To satisfy `2 * y >= x` and `x % y == 0`, `y` must be a divisor of `x` that is at least `x / 2` but no more than `x`. The only value that fits these criteria is `y = x / 2` when `x` is even, or `y = x` when `x` is odd.

However, since `2 * y >= x` must hold true, the only value `y` can take to satisfy all conditions is `y = x / 2` rounded up to the nearest integer that divides `x` perfectly. Given the constraints, the only value `y` can be is `x / 2` when `x` is even, or `y = x` when `x` is odd, but to satisfy `2 * y >= x`, `y` must be `x / 2` rounded up to the nearest integer that divides `x` perfectly, which is `x` itself when `x` is odd or `x / 2` when `x` is even but adjusted to be the largest divisor of `x` that meets the criteria.

Since `2 * y >= x` and `x % y == 0`, the only feasible value for `y` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x / 2`. This means `y` will be `x / 2` rounded down to the nearest integer that divides `x` perfectly.

Given these constraints, the value of `y` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `x / 2` that divides `x` perfectly.

Output State: **The program returns the largest integer `y` such that `y` divides `x` perfectly and `2 * y >= x`.**
