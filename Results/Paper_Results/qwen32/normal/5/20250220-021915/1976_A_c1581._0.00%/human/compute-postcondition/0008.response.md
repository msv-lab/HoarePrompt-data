The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, which iterates over each character in the string `password`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state and how `char` changes with each iteration.

Given:
- `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters.
- `char` is the current character being processed.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `char` has been processed, and we need to adjust the state so that it reflects the start of the next iteration.

Since `char` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, we need to move to the next character in the `password` string.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `char` was the `k`-th character in the `password` string (where `k` ranges from 0 to `n-1`). At the start of the next iteration, `char` should be the `(k+1)`-th character in the `password` string.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `char` is the `k`-th character of `password`.

State at the start of the next iteration: `char` should be the `(k+1)`-th character of `password`.

Since the lists `digits` and `letters` are not in the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. They will be updated within the loop body based on the value of `char`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, `char` is the `(k+1)`-th character of `password`, `digits` is a list that will be updated based on `char`, and `letters` is a list that will be updated based on `char`**. 

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, the final state is:
State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, `char` is the `(k+1)`-th character of `password`**.
