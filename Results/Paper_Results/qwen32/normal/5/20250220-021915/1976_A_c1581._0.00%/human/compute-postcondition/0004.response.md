The code appends the current character `char`, which is a digit, to the `digits` list. The `password`, `n`, and `letters` variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20; `digits` is a list containing the digit `char`; `letters` is an empty list.**
