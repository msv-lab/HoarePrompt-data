The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password` string. If there are more characters in `password` after the current `char`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` is the `(k+1)`-th character of `password`. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` should be the next character in the `password` string, which would be the `(k+2)`-th character.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, `char` is the `(k+2)`-th character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list that includes `char` as its last element. Otherwise, `letters` is a list that includes `char` as its last element.**
