Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, the `digits` list will have all the digits from the `password` string, and the `letters` list will have all the lowercase letters from the `password` string, both in the order they appeared in the original `password`.
