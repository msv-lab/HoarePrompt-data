The code `letters.append(char)` appends the value of `char` to the list `letters`. This means that regardless of the initial state of `letters`, `char` will be added to the end of it. The other variables (`password`, `n`, `k`, `digits`) remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code, which they are not in this case.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, `char` is the `(k+2)`-th character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list that includes `char` as its last element. Otherwise, `letters` is a list that includes `char` as its last element; `letters` now includes `char` as its last element.**
