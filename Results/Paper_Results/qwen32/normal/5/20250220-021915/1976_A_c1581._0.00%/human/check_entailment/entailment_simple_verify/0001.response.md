### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the key components of the problem and accurately describes how the program addresses these components. Let's systematically verify the program using the annotated version and the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads all input at once and processes each test case. This is consistent with the problem's requirement to handle multiple test cases.

2. **Password Validation**:
    - The function `func_1` separates the password into `digits` and `letters` lists. This separation is correctly implemented.
    - The program uses `last_digit_index` to ensure that no letter appears after a digit. The annotated version confirms that the function returns "NO" if a letter is found after a digit, which satisfies the second condition of the problem.
    - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order and if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is correctly implemented and validated by the annotated version.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
    - The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description:
        - Only lowercase Latin letters and digits are allowed (handled by the input constraints).
        - No digit can appear after a letter (checked by `last_digit_index`).
        - All digits must be sorted in non-decreasing order (checked by `sorted(digits)`).
        - All letters must be sorted in non-decreasing order (checked by `sorted(letters)`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong according to the given conditions. The annotated version supports the reasoning and confirms that the program behaves as expected.

### Final:
Final: **True**
