Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element. `n`, `f`, `k`, `t`, and `favorite_value` remain unchanged. `same_value_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`. If the current `value` is greater than `favorite_value`, then `greater_count` is 1. Otherwise, `greater_count` remains 0.**
