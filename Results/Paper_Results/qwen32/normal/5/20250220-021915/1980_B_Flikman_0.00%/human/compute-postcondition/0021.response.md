Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, and `same_value_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`. If `value` is greater than `favorite_value`, `greater_count` is 1; otherwise, `greater_count` remains 0.**
