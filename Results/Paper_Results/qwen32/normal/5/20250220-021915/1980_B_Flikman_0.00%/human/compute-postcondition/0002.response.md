The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into three integers, and assigns them to `n`, `f`, and `k` respectively. The variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet, and `a` remains a list of `n` integers as initially described.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.**
