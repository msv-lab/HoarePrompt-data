Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the value of `t`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `ans` is False; `i` is `m - 3`; `nums` is a list created by converting the integer at index `i - 1` of `arr` into a list of its digits and appending the integer at index `i` of `arr` to this list.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `ans` has been set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
