Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is assigned the value of `t`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `ans` is a boolean value; `i` is `m - 2`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`, where `nums` is a list of integers consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
