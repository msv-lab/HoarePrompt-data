The given code snippet creates a new list `nums` by first converting the integer at index `i - 1` of the list `arr` into a list of its digits and then appending the integer at index `i` of the list `arr` to this list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is assigned the value of `t`
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99
- `m` is at least 2
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input
- `ans` is a boolean value
- `i` is `m - 3`

The code snippet modifies `i` to be `m - 3`, and then it creates `nums` using the value at index `i - 1` and `i` of `arr`.

The output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` remains the value of `t`
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99
- `m` remains at least 2
- `arr` remains a list of integers provided by the user input
- `ans` remains a boolean value
- `i` is `m - 3`
- `nums` is a new list created by converting the integer at index `i - 1` of `arr` into a list of its digits and appending the integer at index `i` of `arr` to this list

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the value of `t`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `ans` is a boolean value; `i` is `m - 3`; `nums` is a list created by converting the integer at index `i - 1` of `arr` into a list of its digits and appending the integer at index `i` of `arr` to this list.**
