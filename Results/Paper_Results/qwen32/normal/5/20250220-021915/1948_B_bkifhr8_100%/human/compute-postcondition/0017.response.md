Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input, `ans` is `False`, `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers created by concatenating the digits of `arr[i - 1]` with `arr[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, `i`, and `nums` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
