To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is assigned the value of `t`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 99\).
- `m` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers modified based on concatenation and sorting checks within a loop.
- `ans` is `False` if any `nums` was unsorted during the loop; otherwise, `True`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet uses a list `['NO', 'YES']` and accesses an element of this list using the value of `ans`. The expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` works as follows:
- If `ans` is `False`, it evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][0]` which is `'NO'`.
- If `ans` is `True`, it evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][1]` which is `'YES'`.

### Determining the Value of `ans`:
- `ans` is set to `False` if any `nums` (which is presumably a list of integers) was found to be unsorted during the loop.
- `ans` is set to `True` only if all `nums` were sorted during the loop.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be `'NO'` if any `nums` was unsorted during the loop, and `'YES'` if all `nums` were sorted during the loop.

### Final Output:
Output: **'NO' if any nums was unsorted during the loop, otherwise 'YES'**
