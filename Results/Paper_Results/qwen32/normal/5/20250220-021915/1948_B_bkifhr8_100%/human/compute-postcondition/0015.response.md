The code snippet provided creates a new list `nums` by concatenating the digits of `arr[i - 1]` (converted into individual integers) with the integer `arr[i]`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, or `i` directly, except for the creation of `nums`.

Given the initial state, the output state will include the updated `nums` list, while other variables retain their initial values unless they are part of the conditionals that follow this line, which are not provided in the snippet. Since the conditionals are not part of the provided code, we assume they are evaluated in subsequent lines of code that are not shown.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input, `ans` is `True` unless `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]` where `nums` is a list created by concatenating the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` with the integer `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `i` is `i - 1`. `nums` is a list of integers created by concatenating the digits of `arr[i - 1]` with `arr[i]`.**
