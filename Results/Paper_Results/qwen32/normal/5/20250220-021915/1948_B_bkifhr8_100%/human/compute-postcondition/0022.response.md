The code snippet provided creates a new list `nums` by taking the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` and appending the integer `arr[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `arr[i - 1]` is `arr[1]` and `arr[i]` is `arr[2]`.

The digits of `arr[1]` are converted to a list of integers and concatenated with `arr[2]` to form `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input, `ans` is `False` if `nums` is not sorted, otherwise `ans` retains its previous value, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list formed by the digits of `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]`.**
