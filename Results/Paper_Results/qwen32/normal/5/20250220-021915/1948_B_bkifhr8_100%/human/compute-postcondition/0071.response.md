Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input. At the current index `i`, if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be `nums[0]`, where `nums` is a list created by concatenating the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` with the integer `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not equal to its sorted version, `ans` is set to `False`; otherwise, `ans` remains `True`. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains `True` and the other variables are unchanged.**
