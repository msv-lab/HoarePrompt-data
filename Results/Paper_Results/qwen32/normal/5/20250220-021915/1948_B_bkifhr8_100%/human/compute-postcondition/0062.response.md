The given code snippet only changes the value of the variable `ans` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is `True`.**
