Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `nums` is a list where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i-1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
