Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input, `ans` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input, and `ans` is `True` unless `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]` where `nums` is a list created by concatenating the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` with the integer `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input, `ans` is `False` if `nums` is not sorted, otherwise `ans` retains its previous value. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list of integers created by concatenating the digits of `arr[i - 1]` with `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, the most internal loop or if statement is broken and `arr[i - 1]` is set to the first element of `nums`, and `i` is `i - 1`. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` and `arr` retain their previous values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input, `i` is 2. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[1]` is now `nums[0]` and the rest of the elements remain as in the initial state, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list formed by the digits of the original `arr[1]` followed by `arr[2]`, and `ans` retains its previous value. Otherwise, `arr`, `nums`, and `ans` retain their initial values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
