Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input; `i` is 4. If `a < b < c` is true, the program remains in the same state. Otherwise, the program remains in the same state. In summary, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged regardless of the condition.**
