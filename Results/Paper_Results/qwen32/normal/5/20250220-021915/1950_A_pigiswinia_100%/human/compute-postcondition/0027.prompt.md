Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if a < b < c:
        print('STAIR')
    elif a < b > c:
        print('PEAK')
    else:
        print('NONE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input. If `a < b < c`, the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy the condition `a < b < c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, then `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input; `i` is 4. If `a < b < c` is true, the program remains in the same state. Otherwise, the program remains in the same state. In summary, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged regardless of the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the new integers obtained from the input; `i` is 5. If `a < b < c`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
