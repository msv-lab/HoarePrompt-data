Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input. If `a < b < c`, the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy the condition `a < b < c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, then `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.**
