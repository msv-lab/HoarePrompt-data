The code snippet provided is simply reading an integer input and assigning it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. After the execution of the code, the value of `t` will be the integer input provided, and the precondition that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000 will still hold.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.**
