The code snippet provided will read three integers from the input and assign them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This will overwrite the previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` with the new input values. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the new integers obtained from the input; `i` is 5.**
