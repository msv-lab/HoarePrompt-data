Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; the loop has executed `t` times; for each of the `t` iterations, the program has read three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input and printed either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c`.**

In natural language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. For each of these `t` iterations, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' if neither condition is met. The values of `t` remain unchanged, and the loop has completed all its iterations.
