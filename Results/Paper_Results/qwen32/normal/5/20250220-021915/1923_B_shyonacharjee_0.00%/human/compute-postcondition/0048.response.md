Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input (updated), `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `success` is True, `position` is the position from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the health from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`.**

In this output state, the variable `time_available` has been assigned the value of `distance`, which is the absolute value of `position`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
