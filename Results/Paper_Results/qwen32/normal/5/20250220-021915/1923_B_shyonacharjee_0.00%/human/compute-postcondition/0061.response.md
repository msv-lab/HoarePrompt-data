Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input (updated), `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`, `i` is `i` + 1, `position` is the position from the `i`-th tuple of `monsters`, `health` is the health from the `i`-th tuple of `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `success` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms: The values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
