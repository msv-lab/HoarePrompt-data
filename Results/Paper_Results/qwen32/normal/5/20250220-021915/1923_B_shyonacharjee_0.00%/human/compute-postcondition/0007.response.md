The code snippet simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `success`. None of the other variables are altered. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `success` is True.**
