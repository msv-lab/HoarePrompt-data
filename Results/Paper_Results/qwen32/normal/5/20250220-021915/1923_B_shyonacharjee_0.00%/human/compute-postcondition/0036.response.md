Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of all `health` values from the `monsters` list up to the point where the condition `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available` is met or all iterations are completed, `success` is True if `total_bullets_used` never exceeded `time_available` for any monster, otherwise False.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations:
- `t` remains unchanged and is still greater than or equal to 1.
- `n`, `k`, `healths`, and `positions` remain as they were input.
- `monsters` remains sorted by the absolute value of the positions.
- `total_bullets_used` is the cumulative sum of the health values of the monsters up to the point where the available time for shooting is exhausted or all monsters are processed.
- `success` is `True` if it was possible to shoot all monsters without exceeding the available time for any of them; otherwise, `success` is `False`.
