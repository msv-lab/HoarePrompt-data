Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` takes two integer arguments, `start` and `end`, such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2:
        print('NO')
    elif cnt1 == 1:
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, no additional changes are made. If `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or `cnt1` is odd, no additional changes are made except that if `cnt1` is not equal to 1, '11' is a substring of `s` if and only if '11' is present in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the new string input by the user, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, no additional changes are made. If `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or `cnt1` is odd, no additional changes are made except that if `cnt1` is not equal to 1, '11' is a substring of `s` if and only if '11' is present in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the new integer input by the user, `s` is the new string input by the user, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the variables retain their described values. If `cnt1` is not greater than 2 or is odd, the variables also retain their described values. In all cases, the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` retain their values as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
