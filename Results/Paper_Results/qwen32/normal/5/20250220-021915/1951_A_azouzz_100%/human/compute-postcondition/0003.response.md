The code snippet `s = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `s`. The values of the other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the value of the user's input.**
