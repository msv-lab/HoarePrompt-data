Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `t` is 0, `n` is the integer input by the user in the last iteration, `s` is the string input by the user in the last iteration, and `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the last `s`. The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations (`t` times), the variables `start` and `end` remain unchanged as per their initial values. The variable `t` is now 0, indicating that no more iterations will occur. The variables `n` and `s` hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, and `cnt1` reflects the count of '1's in that last string `s`.
