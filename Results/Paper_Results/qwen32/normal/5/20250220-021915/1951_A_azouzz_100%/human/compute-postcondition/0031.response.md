Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement.

Let's break down the initial state:
- `start` and `end` are integers with `start <= end`.
- `t` is an integer greater than 1.
- `n` is an integer input by the user.
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `cnt1` is the count of the character '1' in the string `s`.

The conditions provided for `cnt1` do not affect the execution of the `print('YES')` statement directly. Whether `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, less than or equal to 2, odd, or whether '11' is a substring of `s` do not change the fact that the `print` statement will output 'YES'.

Therefore, the output of the `print('YES')` statement is simply 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
