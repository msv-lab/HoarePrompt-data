The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1`), but none of these variables are used within the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely dependent on the string provided within it.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.
2. The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided within the `print` statement.
3. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`) are referenced in the `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
