The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m` and `k` must be greater than `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `m + 1`.

State: **`s` is `2 * c * m * c * m - c * c * m + 2 * c * a`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` must be greater than `m`, `M` is 10, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo 10, `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the input, `i` is `m + 1`**
