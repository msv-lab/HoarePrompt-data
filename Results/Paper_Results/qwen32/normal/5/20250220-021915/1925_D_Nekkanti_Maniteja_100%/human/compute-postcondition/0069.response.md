Output State: **`s` is `s + c * (m + k + 1) * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `k` must be greater than 0; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo 1000000007; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the `m` iterations; `i` is `m + k`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `s` has been updated by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its previous value. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
