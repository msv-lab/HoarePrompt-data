Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input, `i` is 0**.

The value of `s` has been updated to `c * i * c * m + c * a`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
