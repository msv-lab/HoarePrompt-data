Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should consider the probability of each pair being chosen and the increase in friendship value over time.
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is correct for some probability calculations, but the subsequent logic for calculating the expected value is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Loop for Summing Contributions**:
   - The loop for summing contributions (`for i in range(k)`) is incorrectly implemented. The logic inside this loop does not correctly account for the expected value calculation considering the increase in friendship values over the k excursions.
   - The program incorrectly multiplies `c` multiple times and does not correctly handle the increase in friendship values for each pair.

3. **Handling of Friendship Values**:
   - The program sums the initial friendship values of all pairs but does not correctly account for the increase in these values over the k excursions.
   - The program does not consider the probability that a specific pair is chosen in each excursion and how that affects the expected value.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Calculate the expected contribution of each pair to the sum over k excursions.
- Use the probability of each pair being chosen and the increase in friendship values to compute the expected value.
- Ensure that the final result is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the complexity of the correct implementation, it's clear that the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
