Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs during k excursions, given:
- `n`: number of children.
- `m`: number of pairs of friends.
- `k`: number of excursions.
- `f_i`: friendship value of the i-th pair of friends.

The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 each time they are chosen, and it starts at `f_i`. For a pair that is not friends, the friendship value is 0 and does not change.

The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem with the following steps:
1. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. It calculates the modular inverse `c` of the total number of possible pairs of children \(C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9+7\).
3. It initializes `s` (sum of expected friendship values) and `a` (sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs).
4. It reads the `m` friend pairs and their friendship values, adding the friendship values to `a`.
5. It then iterates `k` times, updating `s` with the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
6. Finally, it prints `s % M`.

### Issues in the Program

The provided program's logic for calculating the expected sum of friendship values is incorrect. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Formula**:
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The expected increase in friendship value for a pair of friends on the `i`-th excursion is not just `c * i * c * m + c * a`. The correct approach involves summing up the expected contribution of each friend pair over the `k` excursions.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all excursions involves calculating the probability of each pair being chosen and summing up their contributions. The correct formula should account for the fact that the probability of a specific pair being chosen in any given excursion is `c` (the inverse of the total number of pairs).

3. **Summation of Contributions**:
   - The correct approach involves summing up the expected contribution of each friend pair over the `k` excursions. The expected contribution of a pair with initial friendship value `f` is `f + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)` if they are chosen in each subsequent excursion. The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen is `k * c`.

### Correct Approach

The correct approach involves:
- Calculating the expected contribution of each friend pair over the `k` excursions.
- Summing up these contributions to get the total expected sum of friendship values.
- Calculating the final result as a fraction and finding its modular inverse.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs during the excursions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
