The code snippet `a += f` increments the value of `a` by the value of `f`. Therefore, the new value of `a` will be the sum of its previous value and `f`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 5, `k` is an integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `a + f + f + f`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers read from the input, `i` is 5.**
