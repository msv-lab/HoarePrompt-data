The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer value provided by the input. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken on a value that allowed the loop to execute. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than the input value.

State: **`s = (c * a * k + (c * c * m * k * (k - 1) // 2)) % M`, `i` is incremented by 1**
