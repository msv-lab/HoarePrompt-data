The value of `s` is reset to 0. All other variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `M` is \(10^9 + 7\), `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), `a` is the sum of all f values from the input, `i` is \(m + k\).
