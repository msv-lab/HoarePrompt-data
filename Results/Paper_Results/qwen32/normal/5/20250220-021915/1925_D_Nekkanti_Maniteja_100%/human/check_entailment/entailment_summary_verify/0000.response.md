Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Breakdown

The goal is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction `p/q` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers, and we need to output `p * q^(-1) % (10^9 + 7)`.

### Code Analysis

Here is the provided code for reference:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)  # Modular inverse of the total number of pairs
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

### Issues Identified in the Code

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The code calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - The code then iterates `k` times and updates `s` with `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - This logic does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation. The expected value should be calculated based on the probability of selecting a friend pair and the expected increase in their friendship value over `k` excursions.

2. **Incorrect Iteration and Summation**:
   - The summation logic in the loop `for i in range(k)` is flawed. The code does not correctly account for the probabilities and expected friendship value increases.

3. **Ignoring the Initial Friendship Values**:
   - While the code correctly sums the initial friendship values `a`, it does not correctly account for the expected increases in these values over the `k` excursions.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The code outputs `0` for the first test case, which is coincidental and does not reflect the correct logic.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:

1. Calculate the probability of selecting a friend pair: `p_friend = m / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
2. Calculate the expected increase in friendship value for each friend pair over `k` excursions.
3. Sum the initial friendship values and add the expected increases.
4. Calculate the final expected value and convert it to the required modular form.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the code, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
