You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the reasoning behind the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to compute the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to n for multiple test cases. The program needs to handle up to 10^4 test cases, with each test case containing an integer n up to 2 * 10^5.

### Program Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an array `values` of size `inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1` to store the cumulative sums of the digit sums up to each index.
   - The array is initialized with zeros.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program iterates from 1 to `inf - 1` (i.e., up to 2 * 10^5).
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits and adds this to the cumulative sum stored in `values[i-1]`.
   - The result is stored in `values[i]`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and outputs the precomputed cumulative sum stored in `values[n]`.

### Correctness
- **Precomputation**: The precomputation step correctly calculates the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 2 * 10^5. This step is crucial for efficiently handling multiple test cases.
- **Output**: For each test case, the program simply accesses the precomputed value in `values[n]`, which is correct as it contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `n`.

### Efficiency
- **Time Complexity**: The precomputation step runs in O(m * d), where `m` is the maximum possible value of `n` (2 * 10^5) and `d` is the number of digits in the largest number (6 in this case). This results in a time complexity of O(1.2 * 10^6), which is within the time limit of 0.5 seconds.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(m), where `m` is the maximum possible value of `n` (2 * 10^5 + 1), which is feasible given the constraints.

### Conclusion
The program correctly precomputes the cumulative sums of the digit sums and efficiently handles up to 10^4 test cases within the given time and space constraints.

**Correctness: True**
