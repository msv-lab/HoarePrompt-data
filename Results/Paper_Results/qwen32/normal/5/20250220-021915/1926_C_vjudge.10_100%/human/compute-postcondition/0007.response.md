The loop head in the provided for loop is `for x in str(i):`. This means that the only variables we can adjust are `i` and the state related to iterating over `str(i)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `inf` is 200001
- `values` is a list of 200001 zeros
- `i` is 1
- `sum_value_digits` is `sum_value_digits` + `int(x)`

We need to adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop. Since the loop iterates over each digit in the string representation of `i`, we need to consider what happens after the loop completes its iteration over the current `i`.

After the loop completes for `i = 1`, it will have iterated over the string "1". For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented to the next integer, which is 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `inf`, `values`, `sum_value_digits`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros; `i` is 2; `sum_value_digits` is `sum_value_digits` + `int(x)`**
