The code snippet `value = int(input())` assigns a new integer value to the variable `value`. The initial state specifies that `value` is an input integer, and `t` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. After executing the code, `value` will be updated to whatever integer the user inputs during execution. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `value` is an input integer.**
