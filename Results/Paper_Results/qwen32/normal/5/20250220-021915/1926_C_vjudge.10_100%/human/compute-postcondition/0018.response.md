The provided code snippet is `sum_value_digits += int(x)`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the initial state. Since `x` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value it holds, and thus we cannot compute the exact new value of `sum_value_digits`. 

However, based on the given format and the task requirements, we can still describe the state after the code execution in terms of `x`. 

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0; `i` is 10; `sum_value_digits` is `sum_value_digits` + `int(x)`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`, and all other variables retain their initial values.
