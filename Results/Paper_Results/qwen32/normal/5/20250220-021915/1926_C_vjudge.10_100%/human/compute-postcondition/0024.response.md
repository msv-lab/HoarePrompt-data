Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `sum_value_digits` is set to 0, and all other variables retain their initial values.
