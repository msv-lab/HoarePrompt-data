The code snippet modifies the value of `values[i]` by adding `sum_value_digits` to `values[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 10 and `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0, the value at `values[10]` will be updated.

Since `values[9]` is 0 (as all values are initially 0), `values[10]` will be updated to `sum_value_digits`.

The output state will reflect this change, and all other variables will remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 10; `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `n + 2` plus 2.**
