The provided code snippet only initializes a variable `inf` with a specific value and does not interact with the input values `t` or `n`. Therefore, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `inf` is newly introduced with a value of `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number Vladislav writes; `inf` is 200001.**
