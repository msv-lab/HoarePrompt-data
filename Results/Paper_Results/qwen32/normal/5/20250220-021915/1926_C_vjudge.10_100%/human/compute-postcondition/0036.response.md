To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(values[value])`, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:

1. **t**: This is an input integer with a range of 1 to 10,000. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output of the print statement.

2. **value**: This is an input integer. The exact value of `value` is not provided, but it is used as an index to access an element in the `values` list.

3. **values**: This is a list, but its contents are not explicitly provided in the initial state. We only know that `values[value]` is being accessed, which implies that `values` must contain at least `value + 1` elements.

### Code Analysis:

The code snippet is:
```python
print(values[value])
```

This line of code prints the element at the index `value` in the list `values`.

### Output Determination:

Since the contents of the `values` list and the exact value of `value` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value that will be printed. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given information:

- `values[value]` refers to the element at the index `value` in the `values` list.

Thus, the output will be the element in the `values` list located at the index specified by the variable `value`.

### Final Output:

Output: **values[value] (where values is the list and value is the index used to access the element in the list)**
