Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes an array `values` of size `2 * 10^5 + 1` with all elements set to 0. This array will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for each `i` up to `2 * 10^5`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program iterates from 1 to `2 * 10^5`. For each number `i`:
     - It converts `i` to a string and iterates over each digit in the string.
     - It sums the digits and adds this sum to the cumulative sum stored in `values[i - 1]`, storing the result in `values[i]`.
   - This loop effectively precomputes the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to `2 * 10^5`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints `values[n]`, which is the precomputed cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`.

### Correctness

- **Precomputation**:
  - The precomputation step correctly calculates the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to `2 * 10^5`. This means that for any `n` within the range, `values[n]` will contain the correct sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The precomputation step runs in `O(2 * 10^5 * d)`, where `d` is the average number of digits in the numbers from 1 to `2 * 10^5`. Given that the maximum number is `2 * 10^5`, the maximum number of digits is 6, making the precomputation step efficient enough to run within the time limit.
  - Each test case is processed in constant time `O(1)` since it simply involves looking up a precomputed value.

- **Output**:
  - The program correctly outputs the precomputed cumulative sum of the digit sums for each test case, which matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly and efficiently solves the problem by precomputing the cumulative sum of the digit sums and using this precomputed data to answer each test case.

**Correctness: True**
