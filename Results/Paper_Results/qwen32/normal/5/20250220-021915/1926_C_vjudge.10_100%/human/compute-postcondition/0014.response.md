The provided code snippet sets `sum_value_digits` to 0. This means that the previous value of `sum_value_digits`, which was the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`, is now overwritten with 0. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0; `i` is `n + 2`; `sum_value_digits` is 0.**
