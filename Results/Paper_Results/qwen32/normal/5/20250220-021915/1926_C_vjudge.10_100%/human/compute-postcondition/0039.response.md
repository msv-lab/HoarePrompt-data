To determine what will be printed by the `print(values[value])` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet carefully.

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4).
- `value` is an input integer.

However, there is a variable `values` in the print statement that is not mentioned in the initial state. This suggests that `values` is likely a list or some kind of collection that we need to infer or assume based on typical problem-solving contexts.

Given that `values` is not defined in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of the `values` list and the `value` index. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. `t` is an integer between 2 and 10,000, inclusive. This variable does not directly affect the print statement.
2. `value` is an integer, but without additional context, we assume it is a valid index for the `values` list.
3. `values[value]` refers to the element at index `value` in the `values` list.

Since `values` is not explicitly defined, we can't provide the exact numerical value that will be printed. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **values[value] (where values is a list and value is an index into the list)**
