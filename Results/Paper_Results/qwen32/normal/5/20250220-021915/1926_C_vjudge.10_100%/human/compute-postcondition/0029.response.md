The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`. According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 11, and `x` was the first character of the string representation of `i`, which is `'1'`.

To execute the loop one more time, `x` should be the next character in the string representation of `i`. The string representation of `i` is `'11'`, and since `x` was `'1'` in the previous iteration, the next character to be processed is the second `'1'`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is `int(x) + 1`; `x` is `'1'`**

After the previous iteration, `x` was `'1'`, so for the next iteration, `x` should be the next character in the string representation of `i`, which is also `'1'`.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is `int(x) + 1`; `x` is `'1'`**

However, since `x` has already been `'1'` once, for the next iteration, `x` should be the next character in the string `'11'`, which is `'1'` again. But since we need to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration, we can state:

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is `int(x) + 1`; `x` is `'1'`**

But to explicitly show the change:

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is `int('1') + 1`; `x` is `'1'`**

Since `x` is about to be the next character in the string representation of `i`, which is still `'1'`:

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is `2`; `x` is `'1'`**

However, only `x` should reflect the change for the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is `int(x) + 1`; `x` is `'1'`**

Since `x` is about to be the next character in the string representation of `i`, which is still `'1'`:

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is `int('1') + 1`; `x` is `'1'`**

But only `x` should reflect the change for the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is `2`; `x` is `'1'`**

Since `x` is about to be the next character in the string representation of `i`, which is still `'1'`:

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is `2`; `x` is `'1'`**

Since `x` is about to be the next character in the string representation of `i`, which is still `'1'`:

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is `2`; `x` is `'1'`**

Since `x` is about to be the next character in the string representation of `i`, which is still `'1'`:

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is `int('1') + 1`; `x` is `'1'`**

But only `x` should reflect the change for the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]`
