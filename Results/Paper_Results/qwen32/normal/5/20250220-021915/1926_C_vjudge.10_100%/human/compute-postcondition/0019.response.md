The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which is an element from the string representation of `i`. According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next character in the string representation of `i`.

Given:
- `i` is 10.
- The string representation of `i` is "10".
- At the end of the previous iteration, `x` would have been "1".

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be the next character in the string representation of `i`, which is "0".

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0; `i` is 10; `sum_value_digits` is `sum_value_digits` + `int(x)`; `x` is "0"**
