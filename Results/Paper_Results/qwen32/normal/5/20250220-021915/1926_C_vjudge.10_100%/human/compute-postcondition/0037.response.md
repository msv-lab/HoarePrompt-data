The only variables in the loop head are the underscore `_` and `t`. However, since the underscore `_` is a conventional placeholder for a variable that we don't plan to use, the only variable we can adjust to determine if the loop can execute one more time is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1 (since each iteration of the loop would typically decrement `t` by 1 to eventually terminate the loop). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is an input integer and was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration, we need to adjust `t` to be one more than its current value at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `value` is an input integer.**
