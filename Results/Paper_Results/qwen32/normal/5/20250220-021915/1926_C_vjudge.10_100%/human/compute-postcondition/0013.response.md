The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `inf`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `inf`. Since `inf` is a constant (200001), it does not need to be adjusted. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `inf`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is `n + 2`; `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`.**
