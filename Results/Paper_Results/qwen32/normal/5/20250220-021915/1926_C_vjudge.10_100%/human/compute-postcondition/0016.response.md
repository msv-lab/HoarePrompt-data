The provided code snippet is `sum_value_digits += int(x)`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the initial state, which means we cannot determine the exact value that `sum_value_digits` will be incremented by. Assuming `x` is a string representation of an integer (as `int(x)` suggests), we can only describe the change in terms of `x`.

Given that `sum_value_digits` is initially 0, after the execution of the code, `sum_value_digits` will be equal to `int(x)`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0; `i` is `n + 2`; `sum_value_digits` is `int(x)`**.
