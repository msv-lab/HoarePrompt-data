To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases (input integer).
   - `n`: A single integer for each test case (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5).
   - `inf`: Constant value set to 200001.
   - `values`: A list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0.
   - `i`: Initialized to `n + 2`.
   - `sum_value_digits`: Initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `x` in the string representation of `i`.
   - For each character `x`, it converts `x` to an integer and adds it to `sum_value_digits`.

3. **Loop Iterations:**
   - **First Iteration:**
     - `i` is `n + 2`.
     - `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `i`.
   - **Second Iteration:**
     - `i` is now 10 (as per the given output state after 2 iterations).
     - `sum_value_digits` is updated by adding the digits of 10.
   - **Third Iteration:**
     - `i` is still 10.
     - `sum_value_digits` is updated by adding the digits of 10 again.

### Determining the Final State:

- After the first iteration, `i` is `n + 2`, and `sum_value_digits` is the sum of its digits.
- After the second iteration, `i` becomes 10, and `sum_value_digits` is updated by adding the digits of 10 (1 + 0 = 1).
- After the third iteration, `i` remains 10, and `sum_value_digits` is updated again by adding the digits of 10 (1 + 0 = 1).

Since `i` is set to 10 after the second iteration and remains 10, the loop will continue to add the digits of 10 (which is 1) to `sum_value_digits` indefinitely. However, based on the provided output states, it seems the loop only executes a fixed number of times, likely due to an implicit condition not shown in the provided code snippet.

Given the problem constraints and the provided output states, we can infer that the loop only executes 3 times, and the final state is after these 3 iterations.

### Final Output State:

- `t`: Remains unchanged as the input integer.
- `n`: Remains unchanged as the integer for each test case.
- `inf`: Remains unchanged at 200001.
- `values`: Remains unchanged as a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0.
- `i`: Remains 10 after the second iteration.
- `sum_value_digits`: After 3 iterations, it is the sum of the digits of `n + 2` plus 2 (1 from the second iteration and 1 from the third iteration).

### Calculation of `sum_value_digits`:
- If `i` was `n + 2` initially, and the sum of its digits was `S`, then after 3 iterations, `sum_value_digits` would be `S + 1 + 1 = S + 2`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can't compute `S` directly, but we know the additional contribution from the last two iterations.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0; `i` is 10; `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `n + 2` plus 2.**
