Output State: **The program returns (x + dx, y + dy), where x is equal to a, y is equal to a, dx is equal to b, and dy is equal to b. Given that a and b are both odd integers between 3 and 99, the program returns (2a, 2b).**

In simpler terms, the program returns a tuple where the first element is twice the number of lines in the field, and the second element is twice the number of columns in the field.
