### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by distributing the bets in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculating Product:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.

3. **Calculating `vprod`:**
   - For each multiplier `r` in `vals`, it calculates `prod // r` and stores this in `vprod`. This means each element in `vprod` is the product of all multipliers except the corresponding one.

4. **Calculating `den`:**
   - It calculates `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`. This represents the difference between the total product and the sum of the modified products.

5. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to distribute the bets as required.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as the bets.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

- **Feasibility Check:**
  - The condition `den <= 0` correctly identifies when it's impossible to distribute the bets. If `den <= 0`, it implies that the sum of `vprod` is greater than or equal to `prod`, which means the total bet cannot be strictly less than the payout for any outcome.

- **Correctness of Bets:**
  - If `den > 0`, the bets `vprod` are distributed such that the total bet `sum(vprod)` is strictly less than `k_i * vprod[i]` for each `i`. This is because `k_i * vprod[i] = prod`, and `sum(vprod) = prod - den < prod`.

- **Example Verification:**
  - For the first test case with multipliers `3, 2, 7`, the product `prod` is `42`. The `vprod` list is `[14, 21, 6]`, and `den` is `42 - (14 + 21 + 6) = 1`. The total bet is `41`, which is less than `3*14 = 42`, `2*21 = 42`, and `7*6 = 42`.
  - For the second test case with multipliers `3, 3`, the product `prod` is `9`. The `vprod` list is `[3, 3]`, and `den` is `9 - (3 + 3) = 3`. The total bet is `6`, which is less than `3*3 = 9` for both outcomes.
  - For the third test case with multipliers `5, 5, 5, 5, 5`, the product `prod` is `3125`. The `vprod` list is `[625, 625, 625, 625, 625]`, and `den` is `3125 - (625*5) = 0`. This results in `-1` as expected because it's not possible to distribute the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any outcome.
  
### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets and handles the feasibility check accurately. Based on the provided examples and the logic, the program appears to be correct.
