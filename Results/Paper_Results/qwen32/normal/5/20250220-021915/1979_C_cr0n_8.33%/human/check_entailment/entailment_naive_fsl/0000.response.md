Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, the logic for determining the bets (`vprod`) and the denominator (`den`) is flawed. The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then divides this product by each multiplier to get `vprod`. However, this approach does not ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
3
3 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
2 3 3
```
Explanation:
- If you bet 2 on the first outcome, 3 on the second, and 3 on the third, the total bet is 8.
- If the first outcome wins, you get 3 * 2 = 6 coins (which is not greater than 8).
- If the second outcome wins, you get 2 * 3 = 6 coins (which is not greater than 8).
- If the third outcome wins, you get 2 * 3 = 6 coins (which is not greater than 8).

However, a valid distribution could be 2, 3, 3, as shown above.

The provided program's output for this input would be:
```
4 2 2
```
Explanation:
- The product of the multipliers is 3 * 2 * 2 = 12.
- `vprod` is calculated as [12 // 3, 12 // 2, 12 // 2] = [4, 6, 6].
- The denominator `den` is 12 - (4 + 6 + 6) = -4, which is less than or equal to 0, so it outputs `-1`.

This is incorrect because a valid solution exists.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
