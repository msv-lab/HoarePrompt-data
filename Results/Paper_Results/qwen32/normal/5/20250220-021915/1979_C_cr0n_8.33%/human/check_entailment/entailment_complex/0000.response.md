### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by calculating a set of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any winning outcome. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i` are read.

2. **Product Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `prod = k_1 * k_2 * ... * k_n`.

3. **Partial Product Calculation**:
   - For each multiplier `k_i`, the program calculates the product of all other multipliers (i.e., `prod // k_i`) and stores these in the list `vprod`.

4. **Denominator Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `den = prod - sum(vprod)`. This value represents the difference between the total product and the sum of the partial products.

5. **Condition Check**:
   - If `den` is less than or equal to zero, the program prints `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to distribute the bets as required.
   - Otherwise, the program prints the list `vprod` as the required bets.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The key idea is to use the partial products `vprod` to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any winning outcome.
  - The total bet is `sum(vprod)`, and for any winning outcome `i`, the payout is `k_i * vprod[i]`.
  - Since `vprod[i] = prod // k_i`, the payout for outcome `i` is `k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod`.
  - The condition `den > 0` ensures that `prod > sum(vprod)`, which means the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any winning outcome.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `den <= 0`, the program correctly outputs `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists.
  - The constraints on `k_i` and `n` ensure that the product and partial products remain manageable within the given limits.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the required bets or output `-1` if no valid distribution exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the required bets by using partial products and ensuring the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any winning outcome. The logic handles edge cases appropriately.
Correctness: **True**
