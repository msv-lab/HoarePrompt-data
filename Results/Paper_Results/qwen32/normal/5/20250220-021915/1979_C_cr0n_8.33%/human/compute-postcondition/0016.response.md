Let's break down the given information and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Given Initial State:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **n**: An integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
3. **k**: A list of `n` integers such that \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\) for each \(i\).
4. **N**: An input integer.
5. **vals**: A list of integers derived from the input.
6. **prod**: The product of all elements in `vals`.
7. **vprod**: A list where each element is `prod // vals[i]` for each index `i` in `vals`.
8. **den**: `prod - sum(vprod)`; and `den` is greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
```

### Analysis:
- **vals**: This list contains integers derived from the input. Let's denote these integers as \(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_m\).
- **prod**: This is the product of all elements in `vals`, i.e., \(prod = v_1 \times v_2 \times \ldots \times v_m\).
- **vprod**: This list is derived from `vals` such that each element \(vprod[i]\) is calculated as `prod // vals[i]`. In other words, each element in `vprod` is the product of all elements in `vals` except the \(i\)-th element.
- The `print` statement converts each element in `vprod` to a string and joins them with spaces.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `vals = [2, 3, 4]` for simplicity.

1. **prod**: \(prod = 2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24\).
2. **vprod**:
   - For \(i = 0\): \(vprod[0] = prod // vals[0] = 24 // 2 = 12\).
   - For \(i = 1\): \(vprod[1] = prod // vals[1] = 24 // 3 = 8\).
   - For \(i = 2\): \(vprod[2] = prod // vals[2] = 24 // 4 = 6\).
   - Therefore, `vprod = [12, 8, 6]`.

3. **Output**: The `print` statement will output the elements of `vprod` joined by spaces.

### General Case:
Given the initial state and the calculation above, the `print` statement will output the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.

### Final Output:
Output: **[vprod[0] vprod[1] ... vprod[m-1]] (where each vprod[i] is the product of all elements in vals except vals[i])**
