You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Example

Input

    6
    
    3
    
    3 2 7
    
    2
    
    3 3
    
    5
    
    5 5 5 5 5
    
    6
    
    7 9 3 17 9 13
    
    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
cases = int(input())
for n in range(cases):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
    vprod = [prod // r for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if den <= 0:
        print(-1)
        return
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `vals` from the input, calculates the product of all elements in `vals`, and then computes a new list `vprod` where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` except the corresponding element. It then calculates `den` as the difference between the product and the sum of `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. The function returns nothing (None).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, the logic for determining the bets (`vprod`) and the denominator (`den`) is flawed. The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then divides this product by each multiplier to get `vprod`. However, this approach does not ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
3
3 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
2 3 3
```
Explanation:
- If you bet 2 on the first outcome, 3 on the second, and 3 on the third, the total bet is 8.
- If the first outcome wins, you get 3 * 2 = 6 coins (which is not greater than 8).
- If the second outcome wins, you get 2 * 3 = 6 coins (which is not greater than 8).
- If the third outcome wins, you get 2 * 3 = 6 coins (which is not greater than 8).

However, a valid distribution could be 2, 3, 3, as shown above.

The provided program's output for this input would be:
```
4 2 2
```
Explanation:
- The product of the multipliers is 3 * 2 * 2 = 12.
- `vprod` is calculated as [12 // 3, 12 // 2, 12 // 2] = [4, 6, 6].
- The denominator `den` is 12 - (4 + 6 + 6) = -4, which is less than or equal to 0, so it outputs `-1`.

This is incorrect because a valid solution exists.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
