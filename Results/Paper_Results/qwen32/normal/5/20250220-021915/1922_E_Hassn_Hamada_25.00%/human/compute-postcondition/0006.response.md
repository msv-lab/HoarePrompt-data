The code snippet increments the value of `size` by 1. Initially, `size` is 1, so after the increment, `size` becomes 2. The values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`number` must be at least 3, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case, `size` is 2.**
