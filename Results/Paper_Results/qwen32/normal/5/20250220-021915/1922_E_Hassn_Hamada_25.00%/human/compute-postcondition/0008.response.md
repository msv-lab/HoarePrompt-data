Output State: **`number` must be at least 7, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case, `size` is 3.**

Natural language: The value of `size` has been incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The other variables, `number` and `sequence`, remain unchanged with their initial conditions still valid.
