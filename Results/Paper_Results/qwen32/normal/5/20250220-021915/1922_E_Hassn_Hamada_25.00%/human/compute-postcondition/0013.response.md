The code `sequence.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the `sequence` list. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value that will be appended. We only know that `i` is some integer.

Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`number` is 1000, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case, with an additional integer `i` appended to it, `size` is 9**.
