The code appends the value of `i` to the `sequence` list. Given that `i` is 9, the `sequence` list will now include this additional integer.

Output State: **`number` is 1000, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case, with an additional integer 9 appended to it, `size` is 9, `i` is 9.**
