The function `func_1` takes an integer `number` and a list `sequence`. It modifies the list `sequence` by appending integers and updating existing elements based on calculations involving `number`. The function returns an integer representing the size of the generated sequence. If `number` is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it recursively processes `number` and updates `sequence` accordingly, ultimately returning the sum of `size` and `result`.
