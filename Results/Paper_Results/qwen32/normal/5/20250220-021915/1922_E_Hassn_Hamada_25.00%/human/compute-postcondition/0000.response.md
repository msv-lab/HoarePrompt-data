The provided code snippet does not actually contain any executable Python code that modifies the variables `number` or `sequence`. The comment block describes a function, but the function itself is not defined or called in the snippet. Therefore, the variables `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case.**
