To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables involved in the loop condition: `number` and `size`.

The loop condition is:
```
while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
```
This can be rewritten as:
```
while (2 ** (size + 1)) - 1 <= number:
```

### Analysis:
- `size` is currently 3.
- `(2 ** (size + 1)) - 1` evaluates to `(2 ** (3 + 1)) - 1` which is `15`.
- The loop will execute if `number` is at least `15`.

### Given State:
- `number` must be at least 7.
- `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case.
- `size` is 3.

### Requirement:
To make the loop execute one more time, `number` must be at least `15`.

### Adjustments:
- `number` must be at least `15` to satisfy the condition `(2 ** (size + 1)) - 1 <= number`.
- `size` does not need to be adjusted as the current value of `size` (which is 3) is sufficient to evaluate the condition.

### Final State:
State: **`number` must be at least 15, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case, `size` is 3**.
