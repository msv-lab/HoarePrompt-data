To determine the output of the `print(*a)` statement, we need to understand how the list `a` is constructed based on the given initial state.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it is mentioned for context).
- `n` is an integer value provided as input.
- `x` is a list of integers provided as input.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where:
  - `a[0]` is 500.
  - For all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is calculated as `500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i-1]`.

### Calculation of `a`:
1. The first element of `a` is explicitly set to 500.
2. Each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is calculated as 500 plus the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `x`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 4` and `x = [10, 20, 30]` for illustration.
- `a[0] = 500`
- `a[1] = 500 + x[0] = 500 + 10 = 510`
- `a[2] = 500 + x[0] + x[1] = 500 + 10 + 20 = 530`
- `a[3] = 500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2] = 500 + 10 + 20 + 30 = 560`

Thus, `a` would be `[500, 510, 530, 560]`.

### General Case:
Given the general form of the list `x` and the construction of `a`, the output will be a list where each element is calculated as described above.

### Output:
The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **500, 500 + x[0], 500 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2] (where each element is calculated based on the sum of the first i elements of the list x)**
