The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value such that the loop condition `i in range(1, n)` was satisfied. Since the loop is currently in its `i`th iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The variable `n` does not change during the loop iterations.

Given the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`.

So, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500, `a[1]` is `500 + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, ..., `a[i]` is `500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i-1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` is `500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`, `i` is `i + 1`**
