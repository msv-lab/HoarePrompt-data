You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it constructs and prints an array `a` of length `n` where the first element is 500 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in the input list `x`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly satisfy the conditions of the problem description. The program constructs the array `a` such that `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, but this does not guarantee that `a[i] % a[i - 1] == x[i]` for all `i >= 2`. Let's analyze why this is incorrect and provide a counterexample.

### Analysis of the Code:
The given program initializes `a[0]` to 500 and then computes subsequent elements of `a` by adding the corresponding `x` values to the previous `a` value:
```python
a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
```
This approach does not ensure that `a[i] % a[i - 1] == x[i]` because the modulo operation is not inherently preserved by simply adding the `x` values.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
2
3
1 1
4
2 4 1
```

For the first test case:
- `n = 3`
- `x = [1, 1]`
- Expected output: `a` such that `a[2] % a[1] == 1` and `a[1] % a[0] == 1`

The program will output:
- `a[0] = 500`
- `a[1] = 500 + 1 = 501`
- `a[2] = 501 + 1 = 502`
- Output: `500 501 502`

However, `501 % 500 == 1` (which is correct), but `502 % 501 == 1` (which is also correct), but the program does not guarantee this for all possible inputs.

For the second test case:
- `n = 4`
- `x = [2, 4, 1]`
- Expected output: `a` such that `a[2] % a[1] == 2`, `a[3] % a[2] == 4`, and `a[4] % a[3] == 1`

The program will output:
- `a[0] = 500`
- `a[1] = 500 + 2 = 502`
- `a[2] = 502 + 4 = 506`
- `a[3] = 506 + 1 = 507`
- Output: `500 502 506 507`

However, `502 % 500 == 2` (which is correct), but `506 % 502 == 4` (which is correct), but `507 % 506 == 1` (which is correct), but the program does not guarantee this for all possible inputs.

### Correct Approach:
To ensure that `a[i] % a[i - 1] == x[i]`, we can initialize `a[0]` to any number greater than `x[1]` (to ensure `a[1]` can be constructed correctly) and then set `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i]` if `a[i - 1] > x[i]`, otherwise, set `a[i] = a[i - 1] + k * a[i - 1] + x[i]` for some integer `k` to ensure the modulo condition is met.

However, a simpler and correct approach is to initialize `a[0]` to a sufficiently large number and then set `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i]` because the problem constraints allow `a[i]` to be as large as \(10^9\).

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = max(x) + 1  # Ensure a[0] is greater than any x[i]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)
```

This implementation ensures that the conditions are met for all test cases.
