Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this particular task.
- `n` is the integer value of the input. This specifies the number of elements in the list `a`.
- `x` is a new list of integers. The contents of this list are not specified, so we will denote its elements as \(x[0], x[1], \ldots, x[n-2]\) (since `a` has `n` elements and the first element of `a` is fixed).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where:
  - The first element is 500.
  - Each subsequent element at index `i` (for \(1 \leq i < n\)) is the sum of 500 and all elements in `x` up to index `i-1`.

### Calculation of List `a`:
1. The first element of `a` is always 500.
2. For \(i = 1\), \(a[1] = 500 + x[0]\).
3. For \(i = 2\), \(a[2] = 500 + x[0] + x[1]\).
4. For \(i = 3\), \(a[3] = 500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]\).
5. And so on, until \(i = n-1\), \(a[n-1] = 500 + x[0] + x[1] + \ldots + x[n-2]\).

### Output Analysis:
The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Based on the above analysis, the output will be a series of integers where:
- The first integer is 500.
- Each subsequent integer is the sum of 500 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` up to the previous index.

Since the exact elements of `x` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `a` beyond the first one. However, we can describe the output precisely in terms of the elements of `x`.

Output: **500 500 + x[0] 500 + x[0] + x[1] ... 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]** (where each term after the first is the sum of 500 and the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` up to the previous index)
