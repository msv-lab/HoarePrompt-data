To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. During each iteration, it updates the `i-th` element of the list `a` by adding the `(i-1)-th` element of `x` to the `(i-1)-th` element of `a`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's effect:

- **Initial State**: `a` is initialized with `a[0] = 500` and `a[i] = 0` for all `i > 0`.
- **Iteration 1**: `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 500 + x[0]`
- **Iteration 2**: `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = (500 + x[0]) + x[1] = 500 + x[0] + x[1]`
- **Iteration 3**: `a[3] = a[2] + x[2] = (500 + x[0] + x[1]) + x[2] = 500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`
- **...**
- **Iteration i**: `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] = 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i-1]`
- **Iteration (n-1)**: `a[n-1] = a[n-2] + x[n-2] = 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`

After all iterations, the final state of `a` will be:
- `a[0] = 500`
- `a[i] = 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i-1]` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the input, `x` is a list of integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` is 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i-1] for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, the final list `a` starts with 500, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.
