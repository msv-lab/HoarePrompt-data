The given code snippet appends a character to the string `s` based on the value of `j`. Specifically, it appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j + ord('a')`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `j`, `char_count`, and `s` are part of the initial state. The only variable that is explicitly modified in the code snippet is `s`.

Here's the updated state after the code has been executed:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` remains 1.
- `char_count` remains a list of 26 zeros.
- `s` is updated to include the character corresponding to `j + ord('a')`, which is 'b' (since `j` is 1 and `ord('a')` is 97, `chr(98)` is 'b').

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros, `s` is 'b'**.
