The code snippet provided initializes a variable `s` as an empty string. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `s` is an empty string.**
