The code snippet provided is `s += chr(j + ord('a'))`. This line appends a character to the string `s` based on the value of `j`. Given that `j` is 1, the character appended will be `b` (since `ord('a')` is 97, and `chr(97 + 1)` is 'b').

Here is the updated state of the variables after executing the code:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
- `i` remains 2.
- `j` remains 1.
- `s` now contains the character 'b' (since it was initially an empty string and 'b' was appended).
- `char_count` remains a list of 26 zeros except `char_count[0]` which is `a[2] + 1`.
- The most internal loop or if statement remains broken out of.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is 'b', `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros except `char_count[0]` which is `a[2] + 1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
