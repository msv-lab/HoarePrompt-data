Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 4 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, and `l` is a list. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains the value of `ans` and the new value `x // i`. If `i` <= `k`, then `i` is increased by 2 and the new value of `i` is added to the list `l`. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged. If `x // i` is greater than `k`, then `l` only contains the value of `ans`.**
