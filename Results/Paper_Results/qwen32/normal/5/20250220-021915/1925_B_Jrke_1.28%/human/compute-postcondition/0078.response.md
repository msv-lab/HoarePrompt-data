The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables; it simply moves the control back to the top of the loop for the next iteration.

Given the initial state, none of the variables `ans`, `x`, `n`, `k`, or the number of iterations left are changed by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value among 1 and all valid divisors `i` and `x // i` that are less than or equal to `k`, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`; `x` and `n` are the values obtained from the input; `k` is `x // n`.**
