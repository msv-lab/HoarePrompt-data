Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`. If `k` is 1, then the current value of `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` remains the integer division of `x` by `n` without any further changes; `ans` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 4 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`. If `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), then `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` where `l` is `[1, i, x // i]` if `x // i <= k` else `l` is `[1]`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `ans` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 4 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is `i + 2`. If `x % i == 0`, `l` is a list and `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. Otherwise, there is no change to `l` or `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 4 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is `i + 4`. If `x % i == 0`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` constructed based on the conditions provided. Otherwise, there is no change to `l` or `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
