The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variables `x`, `n`, or `k`, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`.**
