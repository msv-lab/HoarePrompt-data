Postcondition: **`x` is greater than 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`, `ans` is 1, `x % i == 0`, and `l` is `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `l` is `[1, x // i]` and `i` is greater than `k`.**
