The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x. However, the value of `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it remains unchanged. The values of `x` and `n` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8.**
