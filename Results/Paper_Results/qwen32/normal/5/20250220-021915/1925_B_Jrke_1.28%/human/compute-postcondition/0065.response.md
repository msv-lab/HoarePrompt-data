The code snippet `l = [ans]` reassigns the list `l` to contain only one element, which is the value of `ans`. This means the previous contents of `l` are replaced, and `l` now holds only the maximum value from its original contents.

The values of `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the original list `l`, `i` is `i + 2`, `l` is a list containing only `ans`.**
