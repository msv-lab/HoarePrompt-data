The code snippet `l.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `l`. Given that `l` initially contains the value `[1]`, after executing the code, `l` will contain `[1, i]`.

The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and the condition that `x` is divisible by `i` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is also unchanged, but its value is now included in the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 4 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), `l` is a list containing the values [1, i], and `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
