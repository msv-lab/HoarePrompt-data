Let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the provided state to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Given the state right before the loop:
- `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
- `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `size` is `i + 1`.
- `value` is \(2^{(i + 1)} - 2^i\).
- `i` is `i + 1`.

First, let's simplify the loop condition:
\[
(1 << \text{size} + 1) - (1 << \text{i}) \leq \text{number}
\]
Since `size` is `i + 1`, we can substitute `size` with `i + 1`:
\[
(1 << (i + 1) + 1) - (1 << \text{i}) \leq \text{number}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << \text{i}) \leq \text{number}
\]
Which is:
\[
2^{(i + 2)} - 2^i \leq \text{number}
\]

To ensure the loop executes, we need:
\[
2^{(i + 2)} - 2^i \leq \text{number}
\]

Given that `number` is at least 2, we need to ensure that the left-hand side of the inequality is a valid value that can be less than or equal to `number`.

Let's consider the smallest possible value for `i`, which is 0 (since `i` is an integer and we need to check the smallest feasible value):
- If \( i = 0 \):
  \[
  2^{(0 + 2)} - 2^0 = 2^2 - 2^0 = 4 - 1 = 3
  \]
  So, for the loop to execute, `number` must be at least 3.

Since `number` is already given to be at least 2, we need to ensure that `i` is adjusted such that the expression \(2^{(i + 2)} - 2^i\) is less than or equal to `number`. The smallest `i` that satisfies this for `number >= 2` is `i = 0`.

Thus, we need to adjust `i` to 0 and ensure `number` is at least 3. The other variables (`sequence`, `size`, and `value`) do not need to be adjusted as they do not directly affect the loop condition.

Final State:
State: **`number` must be at least 3, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element, `size` is 1, `value` is 2, `i` is 0**
