The code snippet calculates a new value for the variable `value` using bitwise operations. Specifically, it computes `value` as `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Given the initial state, where `size` is 2 and `i` is 0, we can compute the new value directly:

- `1 << size` is `1 << 2`, which equals 4 (binary `100`).
- `1 << i` is `1 << 0`, which equals 1 (binary `001`).
- Therefore, `value = 4 - 1`, which equals 3.

All other variables remain unchanged. The output state is:

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is 2, `i` is 0, `value` is 3**.
