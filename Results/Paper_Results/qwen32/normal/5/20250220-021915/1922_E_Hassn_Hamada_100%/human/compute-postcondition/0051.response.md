Output State: **`size` is 6, `value` is 62, `i` is 1, `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is a tuple (6, 1) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `size`, `value`, `i`, the condition `value is less than or equal to number`, and `size_overlap` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the program execution will exit the most internal loop or if statement.
