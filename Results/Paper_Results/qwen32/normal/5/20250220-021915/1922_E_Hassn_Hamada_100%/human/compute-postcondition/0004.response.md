The provided code snippet initializes the variable `size_overlap` to the tuple `(0, 0)`. This does not affect the values of `number` or `sequence` as they are not involved in the given code. The state of `number` and `sequence` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers representing the array. The length of the sequence should be at most 200 if it satisfies the condition of having exactly 'number' increasing subsequences. If no such sequence exists, sequence should be an empty list or the function should handle the case internally to return -1. Additionally, `number` is not equal to 0; `size_overlap` is (0, 0).**
