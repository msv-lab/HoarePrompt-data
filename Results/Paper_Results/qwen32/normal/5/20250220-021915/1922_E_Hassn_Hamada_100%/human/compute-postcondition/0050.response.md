Output State: **`size` is 6, `value` is 62, `i` is 1, `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is a tuple (6, 1)**.

In this output state, the variables `size`, `value`, `i`, and the condition `value is less than or equal to number` remain unchanged. A new variable `size_overlap` is introduced and assigned a tuple containing the values of `size` and `i`.
