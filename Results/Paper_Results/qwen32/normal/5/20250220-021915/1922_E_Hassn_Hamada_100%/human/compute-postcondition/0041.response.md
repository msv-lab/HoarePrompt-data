To compute the new value of `value` based on the given expression, we need to evaluate `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`:

- `size` is 3, so `(1 << size)` is `1 << 3`, which is `1 * 2^3` or `8`.
- `i` is 1, so `(1 << i)` is `1 << 1`, which is `1 * 2^1` or `2`.

Thus, `value = 8 - 2`, which results in `6`.

The values of `size`, `i`, and `number` remain unchanged as per the initial state. The only change is in the value of `value`.

Output State: **`size` is 3, `value` is 6, `i` is 1, and `number` must be at least 6.**
