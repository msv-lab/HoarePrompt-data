To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand the loop's condition and how it evolves with each iteration.

The loop continues to execute as long as the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` holds true. Given that `i` is 0, the condition simplifies to `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`. This can be further simplified to `2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number`.

From the provided output states:
- After 1 iteration: `number` must be at least 3 (`2^(1+1) - 1 = 3`).
- After 2 iterations: `number` must be at least 7 (`2^(2+1) - 1 = 7`).
- After 3 iterations: `number` must be at least 15 (`2^(3+1) - 1 = 15`).

We can infer that the loop will continue to execute until `2^(size + 1) - 1` exceeds `number`. At that point, the loop will terminate, and the final values of `size` and `value` will be the state of the loop.

The final value of `size` will be the largest integer such that `2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number`. The final value of `value` will be `2^size - 1`.

Let's denote the largest integer `size` that satisfies the condition as `size_final`. Then, `size_final` is the largest integer such that `2^(size_final + 1) - 1 <= number`. The final value of `value` will be `2^size_final - 1`.

Since the problem does not specify a particular value for `number`, we can express the final state in terms of `number`.

To find `size_final`, we can use the logarithm base 2. Specifically, `size_final = floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1`.

The final state of the loop will be:
- `size` will be `floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1`.
- `value` will be `2^size - 1`.

Given the constraints, the final state can be described as:

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1, `value` is 2^(floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1) - 1.**

In simpler terms, the loop continues until `2^(size + 1) - 1` exceeds `number`, and the final values of `size` and `value` are determined by the largest power of 2 minus 1 that is less than or equal to `number`.
