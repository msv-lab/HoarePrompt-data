The given code snippet modifies the variable `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` to it. Given the initial state, `inc` is -1, so `start + inc` is `start - 1`. Therefore, `s` is updated by adding `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` to it.

Here is the updated state:
- `t` remains an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` remains the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.
- `d1` remains a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration.
- `d2` remains a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d2[start]` is `s`.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `lst` remains a list of integers with length greater than 1.
- `start` remains 1.
- `end` remains 0.
- `inc` remains -1.
- `mini` remains unchanged unless `start - 1 > -1`, in which case it is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])` and the previous value of `mini`.
- `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d2[start]` is `s`; `n` is an input integer; `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1; `start` is 1; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `mini` is unchanged unless `start - 1 > -1`, in which case it is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])` and the previous value of `mini`; `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`.**
