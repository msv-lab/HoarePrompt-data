Given the code snippet `s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, the value of `s1` is updated based on the values of `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code snippet.

The initial state specifies that `d2` is a defaultdict with cumulative sum values from `len(lst) - 2` down to `0`. The values of `start` and `end` are indices derived from the input, and they are used to access the `d2` dictionary.

Therefore, `s1` is calculated as the absolute difference between the cumulative sums at indices `end` and `start` in the `d2` dictionary. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from `len(lst) - 2` down to `0` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is the first integer from the new input minus 1; `end` is the second integer from the new input minus 1; `inc` is `-1`; `m` must be greater than 0; `s` is 0; `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`.**
