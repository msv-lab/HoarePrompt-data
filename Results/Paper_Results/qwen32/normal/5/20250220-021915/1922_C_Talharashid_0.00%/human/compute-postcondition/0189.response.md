The code snippet `s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` updates the value of `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` to it. 

Given the initial state, `start` is `len(lst) - 1` and `inc` is `-1`, the expression `lst[start] - lst[start + inc]` evaluates to `lst[len(lst) - 1] - lst[len(lst) - 2]`. Therefore, the absolute difference `abs(lst[len(lst) - 1] - lst[len(lst) - 2])` is added to `s`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is `len(lst) - 1`; `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`; `s1` and `s2` are as previously defined based on `start` and `end`. The condition `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` is false. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**
