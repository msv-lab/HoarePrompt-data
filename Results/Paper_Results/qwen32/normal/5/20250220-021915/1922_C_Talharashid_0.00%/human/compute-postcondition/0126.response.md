Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1` and is now `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from `len(lst) - 1` to `0` with corresponding values of `s` after each iteration, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is the first input integer minus `m`, `end` is the second input integer minus `m`, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` is the total number of iterations that have been executed. If `start` is less than `end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations (as specified by `m`), the loop variable `i` will have reached `t-1`, meaning it has gone through all iterations from `0` to `m-1`. The variables `d1` and `d2` will have been updated based on the values of `s` calculated during each iteration. The variables `start` and `end` will reflect the last set of inputs adjusted by the number of iterations `m`. The variable `s` remains 0 at the end of each iteration, and the final values of `s1` and `s2` will depend on the last `start` and `end` values and the contents of `d1` and `d2`.
