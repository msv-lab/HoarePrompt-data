Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is 0; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `inc` is 1; `m` is the number of iterations; `s` is 0; `mini` is 11111111`. Additionally, `start + 1 < len(lst)` is true, meaning `start` is less than `len(lst) - 1`.**
