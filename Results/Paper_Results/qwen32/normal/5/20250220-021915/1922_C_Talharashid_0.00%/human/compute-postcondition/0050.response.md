Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is `0`, `inc` is -1, `s` is the cumulative sum of absolute differences as calculated in each iteration.**

In natural language: The value of `inc` has been changed to -1. All other variables retain their initial values.
