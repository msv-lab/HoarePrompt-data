Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes the key-value pair `d2[start] = s`; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 3`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is the number of iterations; `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged. If `start - 1 > -1` and `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. If `start - 1` is not greater than -1, no changes are made to the variables. `s` is incremented by 1 if `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`.**

The value of `d2[start]` is updated to `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
