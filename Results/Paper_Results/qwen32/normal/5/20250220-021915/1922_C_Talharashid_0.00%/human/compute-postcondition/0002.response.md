The code snippet initializes a defaultdict named `d1` with a default integer value of 0. This does not affect the values of `t` or the loop variable `i`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `t` and `i`, with `d1` being initialized as specified.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0.**
