The code snippet provided calculates the absolute difference between the cumulative sums stored in `d2` for the indices `start` and `end`. The variable `s2` is assigned this value. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from `len(lst) - 2` down to `0` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is the first integer from the new input minus 1; `end` is the second integer from the new input minus 1; `inc` is `-1`; `m` must be greater than 0; `s` is 0; `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`; `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `s2` is now assigned the value of the absolute difference between the cumulative sums stored in `d2` for the indices `start` and `end`.
