The code snippet provided initializes a variable `mini` with the value `11111111`. This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `mini`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is `len(lst) - 1` (which is at least 1), `end` is `0`, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is `11111111`**
