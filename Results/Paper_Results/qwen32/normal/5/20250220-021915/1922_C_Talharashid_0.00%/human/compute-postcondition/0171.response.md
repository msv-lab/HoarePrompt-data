Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with at least 3 elements; `start` is `start + inc`; `end` is `len(lst) - 1` which is at least 2; `inc` is 1; `m` is the total number of iterations that have been executed; `s1` and `s2` are as previously defined based on `start` and `end`. If `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then the value of `d1[start]` is updated to `s + 1`. Otherwise, the value of `d1[start]` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the value of `start` has been incremented by `inc` (which is 1). All other variables retain their previous values.
