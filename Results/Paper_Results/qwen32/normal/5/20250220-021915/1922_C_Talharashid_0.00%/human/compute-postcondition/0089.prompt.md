Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is `0`, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d2[start]` is `s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is `len(lst) - 2` (which is at least 0), `end` is `0`, `inc` is -1. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. In both cases, `mini` is the minimum of `11111111` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains `11111111`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d2[start]` is `s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111. If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d2[start]` is `s`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1. If `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. If `start - 1 > -1`, then `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
