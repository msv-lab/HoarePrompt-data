Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is the number of iterations; `s` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes the key-value pair `d2[start] = s`; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 2`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is the number of iterations; `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes the key-value pair `d2[start] = s`; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 3`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is the number of iterations; `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged. If `start - 1 > -1` and `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. If `start - 1` is not greater than -1, no changes are made to the variables. `s` is incremented by 1 if `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes the key-value pair `d2[start] = s`; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 4`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is the number of iterations; `mini` is the minimum value between the previous `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise `mini` remains unchanged. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is also the minimum value between the updated `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. If `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
