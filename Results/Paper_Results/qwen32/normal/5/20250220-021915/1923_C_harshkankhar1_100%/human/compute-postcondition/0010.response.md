The code snippet `x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2` updates the value of `x` based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. Given that `i` is `n`, the value of `x` is determined by the `n`-th element of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, the array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, for each query `i`, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` from `b[1]` to `b[i]` and `b[i]` has been updated to `b[i - 1] + x`, `x` is 1 if `a[n] > 1` else 2, `i` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `x` is set to 1 if the `n`-th element of the list `a` is greater than 1, otherwise, it is set to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
