Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, the array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, for each query `i`, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements up to that index from the original `a`, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` from `b[1]` to `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2, `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input, and the program has printed 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, else it has printed 'YES'.**

In simpler terms, the output state remains the same as the initial state, but the program will have printed either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`.
