Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` is set to `i` if `l1[i + p1]` was equal to `a2`, otherwise `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is set to `i` if `l1[i + p1]` was not equal to `a2`, otherwise `idx2` is -1; `p1` is set to 1 if `l1[i + p1]` was equal to `a2`, otherwise `p1` is 0; `p2` is set to 1 if `l1[i + p1]` was not equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0. If `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, no changes are made to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
