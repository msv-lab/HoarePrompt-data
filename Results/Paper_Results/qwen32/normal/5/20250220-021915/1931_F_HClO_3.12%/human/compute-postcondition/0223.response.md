The code snippet `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Given the initial state, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`. After executing the code, `val` will definitely contain at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`.

Let's break down the changes:
- If `val` was initially empty, it will now contain one tuple `(a3, l3)`.
- If `val` was initially containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, it will now contain two tuples: the original one and the newly appended one `(a3, l3)`.

However, the problem states that `val` is an empty list if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`. Since the code appends another tuple to `val`, we can infer that `val` was initially containing one tuple `(a3, l3)` and will now contain two tuples.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are unchanged except `m` must be at least 3, `a1` and `l1` are unchanged except `l1` now contains `a1` at the end if `idx1 > idx2`, `a2` and `l2` are unchanged except `l2` now includes `a2` at the end if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` and `idx2` are -1, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, `val` is a list containing two tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `l` is either `l1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2` or `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, depending on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` and the condition `idx1 < idx2`**.
