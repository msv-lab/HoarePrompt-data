The `print('no')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'no'`. This output is independent of the values of `val`, `l`, `a3`, and `l3` as described in the initial state. The condition provided in the initial state pertains to the relationship between the list `l` and the tuple `(a3, l3)` within the list `val`. However, this condition does not affect the execution or output of the `print('no')` statement.

Output: **no**
