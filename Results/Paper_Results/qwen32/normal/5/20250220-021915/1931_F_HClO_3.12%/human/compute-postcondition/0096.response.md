The code snippet provided is `val.append((a3, l3))`. This line of code appends a tuple containing the integer `a3` and the list `l3` to the list `val`.

Given the initial state, `val` is initially an empty list. After executing the line of code, `val` will contain one tuple: `(a3, l3)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists from the input lines; `l11` and `l22` are lists created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2` respectively; `idx1` and `idx2` are set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0; `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`. Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If `m` is equal to 2, the state remains as described above. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify the variables. `a3` is an integer, and `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l` is a list with `a1` inserted at `idx2`. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l2` has `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` and `l` is now equal to `l2`.**
