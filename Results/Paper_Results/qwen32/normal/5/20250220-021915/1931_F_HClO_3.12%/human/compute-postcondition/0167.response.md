The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 2, and `n` must still be at least 2.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the integer provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`, `i` is 2**
