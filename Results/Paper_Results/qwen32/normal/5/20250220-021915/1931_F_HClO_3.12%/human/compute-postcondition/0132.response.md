The code snippet creates a new list `l11` that contains all the elements from `l1` except for the elements that are equal to `a2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a1` is the first integer from the input line; `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`.**
