The `break` statement will terminate the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` will remain unchanged. The loop or if statement will be exited, but no further changes will occur to the variables listed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`; `idx1` is `i`; `idx2` is `i`; `p1` is set to 1 if `l1[i + p1]` was equal to `a2`, otherwise `p1` is 0; `p2` is set to 1 if `l1[i + p1]` was not equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
