The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. However, the loop depends on the value of `m` to determine how many times it will execute. Specifically, the loop will execute `m - 2` times. 

Given that the loop has just completed an iteration, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the loop will execute one more time if `m - 2` is still greater than 0. This means that `m` should be such that `m - 2` is still at least 1, i.e., `m` should be at least 3. Since the problem statement already specifies that `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, we don't need to change `m`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same with respect to the loop head variable.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
