Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, with `m` decreased by 1 if `idx1 > idx2`; `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists from the input lines, with `l1` modified by inserting `a1` at `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`; `l11` and `l22` are lists created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2` respectively; `idx1` is the original `idx1` value plus 1 if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise it is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `idx2` is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0; `val` is an empty list if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise it is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `m` is equal to 2, the state remains as described above. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify the variables. `a3` is an integer, and `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `idx1 > idx2`, `l` is a list with `a1` inserted at `idx2`. If `idx1 <= idx2`, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l` is a list with `a1` inserted at `idx2`. If `idx1 <= idx2`, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l2` has `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` and `l` is now equal to `l2`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, with `m` must be at least 3; `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists from the input lines, with `l1` modified by inserting `a1` at `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`; `l11` and `l22` are lists created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2` respectively; `idx1` is the original `idx1` value plus 1 if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise it is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `idx2` is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0; `val` is either `[(a3, l3)]` if `idx1 > idx2` or `[(original_a3, original_l3), (a3, l3)]` if `idx1 <= idx2`; `a3` is an integer, and `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, with `m` must be at least 3; `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists from the input lines, with `l1` modified by inserting `a1` at `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`; `l11` and `l22` are lists created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2` respectively; `idx1` is the original `idx1` value plus 1 if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise it is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `idx2` is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0; `val` is either `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3)]` if `idx1 > idx2` or `[(original_a3, original_l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]` if `idx1 <= idx2`; `a3` is an integer obtained from the input; `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, with `m` must be at least 4; `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists from the input lines, with `l1` modified by inserting `a1` at `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`; `l11` and `l22` are lists created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2` respectively; `idx1` is the original `idx1` value plus 1 if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise it is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `idx2` is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0; `val` is either `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]` if `idx1 <= idx2` or `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]` if `idx1 > idx2` (note the additional tuple appended); `a3` is an integer obtained from the input; `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the input.`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
