The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value `a2` at the index `idx1` in the list `l2`. This will shift all elements in `l2` that are at or after the index `idx1` one position to the right.

Given that `idx1` is less than `idx2`, inserting `a2` at `idx1` will change the positions of elements in `l2` starting from `idx1`. The value of `idx2` will increase by 1 because of the insertion, but the relative positions of `idx1` and `idx2` will still maintain `idx1 < idx2` unless `idx2` was initially `idx1 + 1`, in which case `idx2` will now be equal to `idx1 + 1` after the insertion.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists from the input lines; `l11` and `l22` are lists created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2` respectively; `idx1` and `idx2` are set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0; `val` is an empty list; `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, shifting elements to the right; `idx2` is increased by 1 if `idx2` was originally greater than `idx1`.**
