The code snippet `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes an input line, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, assigns the first integer to `a3`, and the rest to `l3` as a list. This changes the values of `a3` and `l3` based on the input, but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` and `l1` are unchanged except `l1` now contains `a1` at the end if `idx1 > idx2`, `a2` and `l2` are unchanged except `l2` now includes `a2` at the end if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` and `idx2` are -1, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, `val` is a list containing two tuples `(a3, l3)` and `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `l` is either `l1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2` or `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, depending on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` and the condition `idx1 < idx2`**

In simpler terms, `a3` is now the first integer from the input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. All other variables remain unchanged.
