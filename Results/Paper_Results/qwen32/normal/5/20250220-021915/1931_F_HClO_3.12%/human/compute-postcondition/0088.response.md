The given Python code snippet reads an input line, splits it into integers, assigns the first integer to `a3`, and the remaining integers to the list `l3`. The initial state indicates that several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val`) have been set up with specific conditions and values, but none of these are directly affected by the new input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists from the input lines; `l11` and `l22` are lists created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2` respectively; `idx1` and `idx2` are set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0; `val` is an empty list. Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If `m` is equal to 2, the state remains as described above. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify the variables. `a3` is an integer, and `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
