Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer, and if `m` is not 1, `m` is unchanged; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` is set to `i` if `l1[i + p1]` was equal to `a2`, otherwise `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is set to `i` if `l1[i + p1]` was not equal to `a2`, otherwise `idx2` is -1; `p1` is set to 1 if `l1[i + p1]` was equal to `a2`, otherwise `p1` is 0; `p2` is set to 1 if `l1[i + p1]` was not equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0. If `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, no changes are made to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then the loop or if statement continues without breaking out. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If none of the above conditions are met, no changes are made to `i` or the loop continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then no changes are made to `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, or `idx2`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, with `idx1` and `idx2` set to `i`. Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the values of `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` are unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, or `idx2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
