Output State: **`t` is adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; an additional input is read but not assigned to any variable.**

Explanation: The `input()` function reads an additional input from the user, but since it is not assigned to any variable, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The only change is that an extra input is consumed.
