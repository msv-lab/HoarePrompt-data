The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a1` and the rest to the list `l1`. The initial state of `t`, `n`, and `m` is not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is 1; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a1` is the first integer from the input line; `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line.**
