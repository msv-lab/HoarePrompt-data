Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`; `i` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
