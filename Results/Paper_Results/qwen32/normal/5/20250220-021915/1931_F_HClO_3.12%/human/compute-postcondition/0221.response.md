The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `m`. Since the loop iterates `m - 2` times, the loop will execute only if `m - 2` is greater than or equal to 1, which means `m` must be at least 3.

Given the current state, `m` is set to 1 if `idx1 <= idx2`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `m` to be at least 3.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are unchanged except `m` must be at least 3, `a1` and `l1` are unchanged except `l1` now contains `a1` at the end if `idx1 > idx2`, `a2` and `l2` are unchanged except `l2` now includes `a2` at the end if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` and `idx2` are -1, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, `val` is an empty list if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, and `m` is set to at least 3 if `idx1 <= idx2`. The list `l` is either `l1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2` or `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, depending on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` and the condition `idx1 < idx2`.**
