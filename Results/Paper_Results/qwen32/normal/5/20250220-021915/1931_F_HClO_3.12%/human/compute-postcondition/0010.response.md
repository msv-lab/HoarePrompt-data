The code snippet creates a new list `l11` by filtering out all occurrences of `a2` from the list `l1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, and `l2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer. If `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. Otherwise, there is no change to `m`. `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line. `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line. `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`.**
