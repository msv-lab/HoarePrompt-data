The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. The value of `i` is 3, as given in the initial state. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `m` is the integer provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`, `i` is 3, `idx1` is 3. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
