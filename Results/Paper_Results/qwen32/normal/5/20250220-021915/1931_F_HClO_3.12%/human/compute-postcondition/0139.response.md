The `input()` function call in the provided code snippet takes an input from the user, but the returned value is not assigned to any variable. Therefore, none of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3**.
