The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must be at least 4 to ensure `i` is less than `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `m` is the integer provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`, `i` is 3**
