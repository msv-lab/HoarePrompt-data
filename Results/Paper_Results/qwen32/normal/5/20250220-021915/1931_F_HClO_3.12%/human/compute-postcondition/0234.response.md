The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `val`, `a3`, `l3`, or `l`. It only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`. The list `l` contains elements such that `l3` is not equal to the list obtained by removing all occurrences of `a3` from `l`.**
