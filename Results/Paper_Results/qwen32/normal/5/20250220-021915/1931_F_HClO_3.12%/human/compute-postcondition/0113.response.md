The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply exits the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, with `m` must be at least 3; `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists from the input lines, with `l1` modified by inserting `a1` at `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`; `l11` and `l22` are lists created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2` respectively; `idx1` is the original `idx1` value plus 1 if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise it is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `idx2` is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0; `val` is a list containing at least one tuple; `a3` is an integer obtained from the input; `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the input and `l3` is not equal to the list obtained by removing `a3` from `l`.**
