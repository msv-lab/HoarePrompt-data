The given code inserts `a1` into `l1` at the index `idx2`. This means that the list `l1` will have one more element, and the elements at and after `idx2` will be shifted one position to the right.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n`, `a1`, `l1` with `a1` inserted at `idx2`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` are unchanged. `val` is an empty list. If `m` is 2, then `m` remains 2. `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. The index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**

In simple terms: The list `l1` now includes `a1` at the position `idx2`, shifting all subsequent elements one position to the right. All other variables remain unchanged.
