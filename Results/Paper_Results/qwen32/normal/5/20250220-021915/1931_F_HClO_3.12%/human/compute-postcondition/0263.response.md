Output State: **`t` is adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 5; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`; `m - 5` new lines of input are read but not assigned to any variable.`**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values.
