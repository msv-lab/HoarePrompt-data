Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the integer provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0`. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
