The code snippet provided initializes two variables, `idx1` and `idx2`, both to the value `-1`. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The loop conditions and the logic related to `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer, and if `m` is not 1, `m` is unchanged; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop continues to the next iteration without altering `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, or `l22`. Otherwise, there is no else part, and the loop continues based on the next iteration's input. `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1`.**
