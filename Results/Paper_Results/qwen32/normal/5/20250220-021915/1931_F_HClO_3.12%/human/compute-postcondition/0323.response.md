The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` at the position `idx2` in the list `l1`. This will change the length of `l1` by adding one element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration.
- `n` is at least 4 (since the loop executed 3 times).
- `m` remains at least 5.
- `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged from their initial values.
- `i` is `n - 2` (since the loop completed `n - 1` iterations).
- `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met.
- `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them.
- `val` is an empty list.
- `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.

After the execution of `l1.insert(idx2, a1)`, the list `l1` will have an additional element `a1` at the position `idx2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 4; `m` remains at least 5; `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged; `i` is `n - 2`; `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met; `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is greater than `idx2`; `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2`.**
