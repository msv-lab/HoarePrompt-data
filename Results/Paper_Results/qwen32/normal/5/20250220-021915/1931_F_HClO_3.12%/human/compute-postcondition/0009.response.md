The code snippet reads a new line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a2` and the remaining integers to `l2`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `a1` and `l1` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer. If `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. Otherwise, there is no change to `m`. `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line. `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.**
