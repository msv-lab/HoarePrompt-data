The code snippet provided updates the value of `b[i + 2]` by subtracting `b[i]` from it. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are not modified by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is updated to `b[i + 2] - b[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `b[i + 2]` is reduced by the value of `b[i]`, while the values of `t`, `a`, and `b[i + 1]` remain unchanged.
