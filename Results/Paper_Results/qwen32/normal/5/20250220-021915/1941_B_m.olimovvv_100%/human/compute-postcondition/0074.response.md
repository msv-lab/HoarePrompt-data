The code snippet `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. The conditions and other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is at least `i + 3`
- `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has already been incremented by 1 at some point before this code snippet)
- If `b[i] < 0`, the loop or if statement would break, but the code snippet provided does not include this break condition, so we assume it hasn't broken yet.

After executing the code snippet:
- `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - b[i] * 2`
- All other conditions and variables remain the same.

Output State: **`a` is at least `i + 3`; `i` is `i + 1`; `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - b[i] * 2`.**
