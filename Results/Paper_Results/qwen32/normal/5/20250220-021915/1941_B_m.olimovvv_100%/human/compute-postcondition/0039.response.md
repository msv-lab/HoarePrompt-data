Output State: **`a` is at least 4, `b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]` and `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
