Output State: **`a` is at least `i + 3`, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the values of the variables remain as specified in the initial state, except that `i` is incremented by 1. The execution also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
