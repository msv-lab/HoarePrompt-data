The provided initial state describes a set of variables and operations, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, or `i`. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state sets up some variables and operations, but these are not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
2. The `print('NO')` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `a`, `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, or `i`.
3. The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'` exactly as it is written.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
