Output State: **`a` is at least 4, `b` is a list of integers where `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is 0, `b[2]` is `b[2]`, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
