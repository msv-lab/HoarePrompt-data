The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`. 

Since the underscore `_` does not affect the loop's continuation, the only state that needs adjustment is the input value that determines the number of iterations. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to increase the input value by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the input value must have been decremented by 1 after the loop body executed. Therefore, to have the loop execute one more time, we need to ensure the input value is one more than it currently is.

State: **If `b[-2] == 0` and `b[-1] == 0`, then 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'. The input value for the number of iterations must be incremented by 1.**
