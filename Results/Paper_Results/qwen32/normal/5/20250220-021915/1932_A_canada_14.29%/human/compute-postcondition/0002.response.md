The code snippet converts an input string into a list of characters and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t` and `len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string.**
