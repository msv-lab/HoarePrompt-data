The provided code snippet `thorn == 0` is a comparison and does not actually change any variable values. It evaluates to either `True` or `False`, but since there is no assignment or other operation, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `i` is the next character in the list `s`**.
