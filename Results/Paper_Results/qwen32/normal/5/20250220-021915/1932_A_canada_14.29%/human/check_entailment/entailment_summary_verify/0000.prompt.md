You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
During your journey through computer universes, you stumbled upon a very
interesting world. It is a path with n consecutive cells, each of which can
either be empty, contain thorns, or a coin. In one move, you can move one or
two cells along the path, provided that the destination cell does not contain
thorns (and belongs to the path). If you move to the cell with a coin, you
pick it up.

Here, green arrows correspond to legal moves, and the red arrow corresponds to
an illegal move.

You want to collect as many coins as possible. Find the maximum number of
coins you can collect in the discovered world if you start in the leftmost
cell of the path.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the
number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the length of the path.

The second line of each test case contains a string of n characters, the
description of the path. The character '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes
a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. It is guaranteed that
the first cell is empty.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer, the maximum number of coins you
can collect.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10
    
    .@@*@.**@@
    
    5
    
    .@@@@
    
    15
    
    .@@..@***..@@@*

Output

    3
    4
    3

The picture for the first example is in the problem statement.

And here is the picture for the third example:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/1695fc45669a1bf1d6e1b3d4901cdd3cda38273c.png)

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        len = int(input())
        s = list(input())
        ret = 0
        thorn = 0
        for i in s:
            if i == '@':
                thorn = 0
                ret += 1
            elif i == '*':
                thorn += 1
                if thorn == 2:
                    break
            else:
                thorn == 0
        print(ret)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of characters '.', '@', and '*'. For each test case, it counts the number of '@' characters encountered before the appearance of two consecutive '*' characters and prints this count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem description. Specifically, the code does not account for the fact that you can move one or two cells at a time, and it incorrectly breaks out of the loop when encountering two consecutive thorns.

Here is an example that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
6
.@.@.@
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

This example seems to work, but consider another case:

**Input:**
```
1
7
.@..@.@
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

In the second example, the code will incorrectly stop counting coins after the first thorn because it encounters two thorns in sequence (one empty cell, then two thorns). The correct approach should involve dynamic programming or a similar method to consider the maximum coins that can be collected by moving one or two cells at a time, avoiding thorns.

The code logic is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of skipping over thorns to collect coins further down the path. It also incorrectly uses `thorn == 0` instead of `thorn = 0` in the `else` block, which is a syntax error.

Here is a corrected version of the code for reference:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if s[i - 1] == '*':
                dp[i] = -float('inf')  # Mark cells with thorns as unreachable
            else:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + (s[i - 1] == '@'))
                if i > 1:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 2] + (s[i - 1] == '@'))
        print(dp[n])

func()
```

This corrected code uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum number of coins that can be collected up to each cell, considering moves of one or two cells at a time and avoiding thorns.
