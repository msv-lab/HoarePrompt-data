Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn == 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2; if the current character `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1; otherwise, `ret` is 0. If `i` is equal to '*', then `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` was 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not equal to '*', then `thorn` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the next character in `s`. If the next character `i` is '@', then `ret` is set to 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1, and if `thorn` was 2, it is now 3. If `i` is not '@', `ret` is set to 0. If `i` is not '*', `thorn` remains unchanged (either 0, 1, or 2).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is increased by 1. If `i` is not '@', `thorn` is updated based on the next character in `s`. Specifically, if `i` is '*', `thorn` can be 1, 2, or 3, and if `thorn` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `thorn` remains either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the next character in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
