Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the previous `i`, `thorn` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `len`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `thorn` is incremented by 1. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
