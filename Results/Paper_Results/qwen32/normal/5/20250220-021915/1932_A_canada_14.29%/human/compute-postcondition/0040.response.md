The code snippet `len = int(input())` updates the value of `len` to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `ret`, and `thorn`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ret` is the total number of '@' characters encountered in `s` before `thorn` reaches 2; `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2**.
