The code snippet increments the variable `ret` by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 0, `i` is the next character in the list `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 0, `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**
