The code snippet provided initializes a variable `thorn` to 0. No other variables are affected or modified by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `len`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the previous `i`, `thorn` is 0**.
