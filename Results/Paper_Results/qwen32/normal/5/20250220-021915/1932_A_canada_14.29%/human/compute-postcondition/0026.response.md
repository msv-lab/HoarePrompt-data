Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; if the next character `i` is '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1. If `thorn` was 2 before incrementing, it is now 3, and if the next character `i` is '@', `ret` is set to 1; otherwise, `ret` is set to 0. If `thorn` was not 2, it remains 2. If the next character `i` is not '*', `thorn` remains unchanged (either 0, 1, or 2). If the next character `i` is '@', `ret` is set to 1; otherwise, `ret` is set to 0.**
