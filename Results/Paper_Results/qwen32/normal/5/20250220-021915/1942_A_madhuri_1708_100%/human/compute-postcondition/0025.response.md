Output State: **the loop has processed all `t` test cases, and the program has printed the appropriate output for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.**

Natural language explanation: After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the program has processed each test case provided in the input. For each test case, it has checked the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, it has printed `k` repeated `k` times if `n` equals `k`, or `-1` if `n` does not equal `k`. If `k` is less than 2, it has printed the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` have been updated accordingly during each iteration, but the overall state reflects that all test cases have been handled and the corresponding outputs have been printed.
