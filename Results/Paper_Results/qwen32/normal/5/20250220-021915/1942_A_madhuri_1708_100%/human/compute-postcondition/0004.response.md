To determine the output of the given code snippet, let's break down the provided initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. There are at least `t` lines in the input where the first line is `t` and the subsequent `t` lines are the inputs for each test case.
3. `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting and converting the string `s` for each test case.
4. The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to 2.
5. `n` is equal to `k`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(*[k for j in range(k)])
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The list comprehension `[k for j in range(k)]` generates a list containing the value `k`, repeated `k` times.
2. The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the list, so each element of the list is printed as a separate argument to `print`, separated by spaces.

### Detailed Output Description:
- For each test case, `k` is a specific integer (greater than or equal to 2).
- The list comprehension `[k for j in range(k)]` will produce a list with `k` elements, all of which are `k`.
- The `print(*[k for j in range(k)])` statement will print these `k` elements, separated by spaces.

### Example:
If `k` is 3, the list comprehension `[k for j in range(k)]` will generate `[3, 3, 3]`. The `print` statement will then output `3 3 3`.

### General Output:
Given that `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, the output will be a sequence of `k` numbers, each of which is `k`, separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **k k k ... k (where k is repeated k times)**
