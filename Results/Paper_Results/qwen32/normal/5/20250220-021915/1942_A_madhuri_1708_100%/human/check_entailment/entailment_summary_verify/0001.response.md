Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to ensure the correctness of the solution. We need to verify if the program correctly handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem constraints.

### Problem Recap

We are tasked with constructing an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted. The cyclic shifts of an array involve rotating the array, and a sorted array has elements in non-decreasing order.

### Program Recap

Here is the provided program for reference:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])
```

### Function Summary Recap

- If `k >= 2`:
  - If `n == k`, it prints an array with `k` repeated `k` times.
  - If `n != k`, it prints `-1`.
- If `k < 2`:
  - It prints an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Analysis of the Program

Let's break down the program logic and verify it against the problem requirements:

1. **Case 1: `k >= 2`**
   - **Sub-case 1.1: `n == k`**
     - The program outputs an array where all elements are equal to `k`.
     - Example: For `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the output is `[3, 3, 3]`.
     - All cyclic shifts of `[3, 3, 3]` are `[3, 3, 3]`, which is sorted.
     - This satisfies the condition that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - **Sub-case 1.2: `n != k`**
     - The program outputs `-1`.
     - This is correct because if `n > k`, it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts with distinct elements. If `n < k`, it is also impossible because `k` cannot be greater than the number of cyclic shifts.
     - The program correctly identifies these impossible cases and outputs `-1`.

2. **Case 2: `k < 2`**
   - The program outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - Only the first cyclic shift (the array itself) is sorted.
   - This satisfies the condition that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted when `k = 1`.

### Verification Against Provided Test Cases

Let's verify the program against the provided test cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `n = 2`, `k = 2`
  - Output: `1 1`
  - All cyclic shifts of `[1, 1]` are `[1, 1]`, which is sorted.
  - This satisfies the condition that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `n = 3`, `k = 1`
  - Output: `1 2 3`
  - Only the first cyclic shift `[1, 2, 3]` is sorted.
  - This satisfies the condition that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `n = 3`, `k = 2`
  - Output: `-1`
  - It is impossible to have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts out of 3 for distinct elements.
  - The program correctly identifies this impossible case and outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all possible cases as per the problem description and outputs the correct results for each scenario. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
