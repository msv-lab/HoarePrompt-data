The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'-1'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `s`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the given `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is an integer that represents the number of test cases.
2. The variable `s` is a string that is read from the input after reading `t`.
3. The string `s` is then split and converted to integers `n` and `k`, which are not used in the provided code snippet.

Since the `print` statement is `print('-1')`, it will print the string `'-1'` regardless of the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, or `k`.

Output: **-1**
