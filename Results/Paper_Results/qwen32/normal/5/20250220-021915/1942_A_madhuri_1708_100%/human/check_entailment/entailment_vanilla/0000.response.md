Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks to construct an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted.

- **Cyclic Shift**: A cyclic shift of an array `a` means rotating the array. For example, the cyclic shifts of `[1, 2, 3]` are `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 1, 2]`.
- **Sorted Array**: An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
- **Constraints**: 
  - `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for each `i`.
  - `1 <= k <= n <= 1000`.
  - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 1000.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:

1. **Reading Input**: It reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Handling Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: If `k >= 2`:
     - If `n == k`, it outputs an array with `k` identical elements (all equal to `k`).
     - If `n != k`, it outputs `-1`.
   - **Case 2**: If `k < 2`:
     - It outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which is a sorted array.

### Correctness Evaluation

Let's evaluate the correctness of the program for different cases:

1. **Case 1: `k >= 2`**
   - **Sub-case 1.1: `n == k`**
     - The program outputs an array with `k` identical elements. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 3`, it outputs `[3, 3, 3]`.
     - All cyclic shifts of `[3, 3, 3]` are `[3, 3, 3]`, which is sorted.
     - This satisfies the condition that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - **Sub-case 1.2: `n != k`**
     - The program outputs `-1`.
     - If `n > k`, it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts because having `n` elements with `k` sorted shifts would require a specific arrangement that the program does not handle.
     - If `n < k`, it is also impossible because `k` cannot be greater than the number of cyclic shifts.
     - The program correctly identifies these impossible cases and outputs `-1`.

2. **Case 2: `k < 2`**
   - The program outputs a sorted array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - Only the first cyclic shift (the array itself) is sorted.
   - This satisfies the condition that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted when `k = 1`.

### Conclusion

The program handles all possible cases as per the problem description and outputs the correct results for each scenario. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
