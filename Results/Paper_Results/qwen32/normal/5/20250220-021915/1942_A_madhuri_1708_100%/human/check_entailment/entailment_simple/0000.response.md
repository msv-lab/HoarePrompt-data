### Reasoning:
Let's break down the logic of the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

1. **Scenario where `k >= 2`:**
   - **If `n == k`:** The program outputs an array where all elements are equal to `k`. This array will indeed have `n` (which is equal to `k`) sorted cyclic shifts, because all cyclic shifts of an array with identical elements are identical and sorted.
   - **If `n > k`:** The program outputs `-1`. This is because if `n > k`, it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. If we had an array with `k` equal elements and the rest different, we wouldn't be able to control the number of sorted cyclic shifts precisely to `k` without violating the constraints. Therefore, the only way to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k >= 2` is when `n == k`.

2. **Scenario where `k == 1`:**
   - The program outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself. All other cyclic shifts will not be sorted because the smallest element is at the start, and cyclically shifting it will place the smallest element in a position other than the start, making the array unsorted.

3. **Scenario where `k == 0`:**
   - The problem description does not specify a scenario where `k == 0`, and the program does not handle this case. However, since `k` is guaranteed to be at least 1, this scenario is not relevant.

### Analysis of Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1 (`n = 2, k = 2`):**
  - Expected Output: An array with two identical elements, e.g., `[1, 1]`.
  - Program Output: `[2, 2]` (since `k == n`).
  - This output is correct.

- **Test Case 2 (`n = 3, k = 1`):**
  - Expected Output: An array with elements in increasing order, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - Program Output: `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - This output is correct.

- **Test Case 3 (`n = 3, k = 2`):**
  - Expected Output: `-1` (since it's impossible to have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts out of 3).
  - Program Output: `-1`.
  - This output is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all scenarios as described in the problem statement. It correctly outputs an array with `n` identical elements when `k == n` and `k >= 2`. It correctly outputs an array with elements in increasing order when `k == 1`. It also correctly outputs `-1` when `n > k` and `k >= 2`.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
