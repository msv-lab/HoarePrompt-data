You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
        
    #State: the loop has processed all `t` test cases, and the program has printed the appropriate output for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, given two integers `n` and `k`, it prints a sequence of numbers based on specific conditions: if `k` is 1, it prints numbers from 1 to `n`; if `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` equals `k`, it prints `k` repeated `k` times; otherwise, it prints `-1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Case when `k == 1`:**
   - The program prints the array `[1, 2, ..., n]` which is always sorted. However, this array has only one sorted cyclic shift (the array itself), not exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. For `k == 1` and `n > 1`, the program should print an array that has exactly one sorted cyclic shift. The current implementation does not guarantee this.

2. **Case when `k == n`:**
   - The program correctly prints an array where all elements are the same (e.g., `[k, k, ..., k]`). This array has exactly `n` sorted cyclic shifts, which is correct.

3. **Case when `2 <= k < n`:**
   - The program prints `-1` for all cases where `k` is not equal to `1` or `n`. However, there are valid arrays that can have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts for `2 <= k < n`. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]`, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2]`.

### Counterexample:
For the input `3 2`, the program outputs `-1`, but a valid output could be `1 2 1` or `2 1 2`, both of which have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts.

### Conclusion:
The program does not cover all valid cases for `2 <= k < n` and incorrectly handles the case when `k == 1` for `n > 1`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
