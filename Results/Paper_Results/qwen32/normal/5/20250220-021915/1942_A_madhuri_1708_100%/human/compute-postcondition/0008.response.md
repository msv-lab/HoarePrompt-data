Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and there are at least `t` lines in the input where the first line is `t` and the subsequent `t` lines are the inputs for each test case; `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting and converting the string `s`. Additionally, `k` is less than 2.**
