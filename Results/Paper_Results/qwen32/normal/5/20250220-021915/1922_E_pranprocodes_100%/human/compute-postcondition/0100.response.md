The code snippet `min += 1` increments the value of `min` by 1. Given the initial state, `min` is either `-99999999` if `x` is even or `-100000000` if `x` is odd. After the increment, `min` will be `-99999998` if `x` is even, or `-99999999` if `x` is odd.

No other variables are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [100000000, -99999999] if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -100000000], `t` is 1, `i` is 3**
