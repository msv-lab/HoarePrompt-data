The given `print` statement is `print(*ans)`. The `*` operator in the `print` function is used to unpack the list `ans` and print each of its elements separated by a space.

From the initial state, we know that `ans` is a list containing the elements `[99999999, -100000000, 100000000]`.

Therefore, the `print(*ans)` statement will print each element of the list `ans` on the same line, separated by spaces.

Output: **99999999 -100000000 100000000**
