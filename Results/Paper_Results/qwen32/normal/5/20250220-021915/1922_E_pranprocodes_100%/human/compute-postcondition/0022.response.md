The code increments the value of `min` by 1. Therefore, if `x` is even, `min` was -100000000 and is now -99999999. If `x` is odd, `min` was -99999999 and is now -99999998. The values of `x`, `max`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer input value that is greater than 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, `max` is 100000000 if `x` is odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is even, `min` is -99999998 if `x` is odd, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000 and `min` if `x` is even, `ans` is a list containing the value -100000000 and `min` if `x` is odd, and `t` is 1.**
