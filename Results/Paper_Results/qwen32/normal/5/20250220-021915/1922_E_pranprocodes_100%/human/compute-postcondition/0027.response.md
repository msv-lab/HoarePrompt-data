The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Therefore, the list `ans` will now contain three elements: the original two elements and the newly appended `max` value. The initial values of `x`, `max`, `min`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even, and 100000000 if `x` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and `x` was originally even, -99999999 if `x` was odd or `x` was originally odd, `ans` is a list containing the values 100000000, 99999999, and `max`, `t` is 2**.
