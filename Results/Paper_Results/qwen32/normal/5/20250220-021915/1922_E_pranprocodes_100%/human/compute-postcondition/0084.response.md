The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is the input integer. To ensure the loop executes the first time, `x` must not be equal to 1.

State: **`x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [], `t` is 0, `i` is 3**
