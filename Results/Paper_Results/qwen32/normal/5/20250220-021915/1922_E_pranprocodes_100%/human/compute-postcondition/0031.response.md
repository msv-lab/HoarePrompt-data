Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even, and 100000000 if `x` was odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` was even and `x` was originally even, -99999998 if `x` was odd or `x` was originally odd, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, `min`] if `x` was even, or [100000000, `min`, `min`] if `x` was odd, `t` is 2.**

Natural language: The value of `min` has been incremented by 1. The values of `x`, `max`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.
