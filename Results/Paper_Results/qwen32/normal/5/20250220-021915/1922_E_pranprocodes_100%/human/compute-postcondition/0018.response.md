The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Given the initial conditions, `max` is either `99999999` if `x` is odd or `99999999` if `x` is even (since the initial state specifies `max` as `99999999` if `x` is odd and `99999999` is a typo and should be `99999999` for odd and `99999999` for even, but it's `99999999` for both in the provided conditions, which seems to be a mistake). The list `ans` initially contains either `-100000000` if `x` is odd or `100000000` if `x` is even. After appending `max`, the list `ans` will contain two elements.

Output State: **`x` is an integer input value that is greater than 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000 and 99999999 if `x` is even, `ans` is a list containing the value -100000000 and 99999999 if `x` is odd, and `t` is 1.**
