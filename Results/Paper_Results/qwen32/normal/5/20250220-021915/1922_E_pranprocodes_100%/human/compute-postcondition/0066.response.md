The code snippet provided is `ans.append(max)`. This line of code appends the built-in Python function `max` to the list `ans`. The value of `x` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ans` now contains the `max` function, and `x` retains its original value.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1; `ans` contains the `max` function**.
