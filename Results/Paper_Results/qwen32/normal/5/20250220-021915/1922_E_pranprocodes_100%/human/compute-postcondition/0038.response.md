To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `x` is initialized to 1.
- `max` and `min` are adjusted based on the number of even and odd operations. However, the exact operations that adjust `max` and `min` are not specified.
- `ans` is a list that contains `max` and `min` values based on the operations, but in reversed order.
- `t` is the total number of iterations. However, the exact number of iterations or the operations themselves are not specified.

### Analysis:
- Since the exact operations that adjust `max` and `min` are not specified, we can't determine the exact values of `max` and `min`.
- However, we know that `ans` is a list containing these `max` and `min` values in reversed order.
- The print statement `print(*ans)` will print the elements of the `ans` list, separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `max` and `min`. But we know that `ans` contains these values in reversed order. Therefore, the output will be the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the elements of the list `ans`, which contains `max` and `min` values in reversed order. Since the exact values of `max` and `min` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `max` and `min`.

Output: **min max (where min and max are the adjusted minimum and maximum values based on the operations, in reversed order)**
