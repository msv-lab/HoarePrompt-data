For the given task, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `_` (an unused variable) and `test_cases`. The loop will execute based on the value of `test_cases`. Since `_` is not used in the loop head and does not affect the execution of the loop, we only need to ensure that `test_cases` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute.

Given that the problem states `1 <= test_cases <= 10^4`, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is within this range for the loop to execute at least once.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `test_cases` <= 10^4**
