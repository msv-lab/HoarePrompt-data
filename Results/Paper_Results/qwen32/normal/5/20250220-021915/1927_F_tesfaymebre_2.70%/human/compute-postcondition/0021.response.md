Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path taken in the DFS traversal and now includes `curr` as its last element, the color of the current vertex (`colors[curr]`) is 1, `graph[curr]` must have at least one neighbor, `nei` is `next_nei`, where `next_nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in `graph[curr]` that meets the conditions (`colors[next_nei] != 2` and `next_nei != parent`), `res` is the result returned by the `dfs` function with `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent vertex, and the updated `path`, `set_res` is a set created from the elements of `res`.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that a new variable `set_res` has been created, which is a set of the elements in `res`. All other variables retain their initial state and values.
