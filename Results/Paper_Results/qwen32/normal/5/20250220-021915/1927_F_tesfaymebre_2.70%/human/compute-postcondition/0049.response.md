Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges, with the first tuple removed; `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)` for the next tuple `(w, u, v)` in the list; `parent_v` is the result of `dsu.find(v)` for the same tuple `(w, u, v)`.**

In natural language: The list `edges` remains unchanged. The variable `parent_u` keeps its previous value, which is the result of `dsu.find(u)` for the next tuple `(w, u, v)` in the list. The variable `parent_v` is now assigned the value of `dsu.find(v)` for the same tuple `(w, u, v)`.
