Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()`, where 3 <= n <= m <= min((n*(n - 1))/2, 2 * 10^5); `graph` is a defaultdict of lists with each node having a list of adjacent nodes; `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges; `m` iterations have completed; `i` is `m-1`; `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration; all edges specified by the `func_3()` calls have been added to `graph` and `edges`; `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class initialized with `n + 1` elements; `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`; `node_u` is -1; `node_v` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)
        if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
            _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
            node_u = u
            node_v = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges; `parent_u` is the root parent of node `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method; `parent_v` is the root parent of node `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, then if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, and `node_u` and `node_v` are updated to `u` and `v` respectively. Otherwise, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` remain unchanged. If `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`, `parent_u` becomes the root parent of both `u` and `v` (assuming `u`'s set is larger or equal in rank/size), and `parent_v` is updated to point to `parent_u` (or vice versa, depending on the implementation details of the union operation).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges; `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the root parents of nodes `u` and `v` respectively, as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` methods. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, then the sets containing nodes `u` and `v` are merged, and the root parent of either `u` or `v` is updated to the root parent of the other node. If `parent_u` does not equal `parent_v`, and if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, then `_min_edge` is assigned the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `node_u` is set to `u`, and `node_v` is set to `v`. Otherwise, these variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges, with the first tuple removed; `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the results of `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` respectively for the next tuple `(w, u, v)` in the list. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, no union operation is performed, and `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the union of the sets containing `u` and `v` is performed in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to reflect the new root of the merged set, and if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, `_min_edge` is assigned the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `node_u` is set to `u`, and `node_v` is set to `v`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
