You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given code step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of vertices) and `m` (number of edges).
   - It then reads `m` edges, each consisting of two vertices `u` and `v` and a weight `w`.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list stored in a `defaultdict` named `graph`.
   - The edges are also stored in a list named `edges` with each edge represented as a tuple `(w, u, v)`.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - A DSU (also known as Union-Find) data structure is used to keep track of connected components.
   - The DSU has a method `find` to find the root of a node and a method `union` to union two sets.
   - Each set in the DSU keeps track of the minimum edge weight that connects any two nodes in that set.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and tries to add them to the DSU.
   - If adding an edge forms a cycle (i.e., both endpoints of the edge are already in the same set), it checks if this is the lightest edge seen so far that forms a cycle.
   - It updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in forming this cycle.

6. **Cycle Reconstruction**:
   - After identifying the lightest edge that forms a cycle, the program uses a Depth-First Search (DFS) to reconstruct the cycle starting from one of the endpoints of this edge.
   - The DFS is used to traverse the graph and find the cycle.

7. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program outputs the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then outputs the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Correctness Evaluation

- **Cycle Detection**: The program correctly identifies the lightest edge that forms a cycle by leveraging the DSU data structure.
- **Cycle Reconstruction**: The DFS is used to correctly reconstruct the cycle starting from the identified edge.
- **Output**: The program outputs the correct weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the vertices of the cycle.

### Conclusion

The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently finds a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge and outputs the required information.

**Correctness: True**
