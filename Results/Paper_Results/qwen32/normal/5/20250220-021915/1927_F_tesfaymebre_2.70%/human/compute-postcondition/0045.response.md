The code `dsu.union(u, v, w)` will perform a union operation on the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure, merging the sets containing nodes `u` and `v`. After this operation, the root parent of one of the nodes will be updated to the root parent of the other node, effectively connecting the two sets.

Given the initial state and the operation performed, the updated state will be:
- The sets containing nodes `u` and `v` are now merged.
- The root parent of one of the nodes (`parent_u` or `parent_v`) will be updated to the root parent of the other node.

Since the specific values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` after the union operation depend on the implementation details of the `dsu.union` method (which might involve rank or size optimizations), we can only specify that one of them will be updated to reflect the new parent relationship.

Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges; the sets containing nodes `u` and `v` are now merged; the root parent of either `u` or `v` is updated to the root parent of the other node.**
