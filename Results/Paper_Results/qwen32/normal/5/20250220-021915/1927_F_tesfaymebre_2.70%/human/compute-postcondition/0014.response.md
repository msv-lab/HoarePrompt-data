Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path taken in the DFS traversal and now includes `curr` as its last element, the color of the current vertex (`colors[curr]`) is 1, `graph[curr]` must have at least one neighbor, `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in `graph[curr]` that meets the conditions (`colors[nei] != 2` and `nei != parent`), `res` is the result returned by the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`**

In simpler terms: The output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the addition of the variable `res`, which holds the result of the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`.
