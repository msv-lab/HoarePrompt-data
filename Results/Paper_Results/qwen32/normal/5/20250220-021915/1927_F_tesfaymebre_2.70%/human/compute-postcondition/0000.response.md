Output State: **`test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()`, where 1 <= `test_cases` <= 10^4.**

Explanation: The value of `test_cases` is updated to the value returned by the function `func_1()`. The precondition that `test_cases` was an integer representing the number of test cases, with a range from 1 to 10^4, remains valid, but now it holds the specific value returned by `func_1()`.
