The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. However, the loop still depends on the `test_cases` variable to determine how many times it will iterate. To execute one more time, `test_cases` must be decremented by 1 since the loop will run as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` was such that 0 < `test_cases` <= 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0 after decrementing it by 1.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `test_cases` <= 10^4**
