Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges, with the first tuple removed; `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)` for the next tuple `(w, u, v)` in the list; `parent_v` is yet to be determined.**

In simpler terms, after executing the code, `parent_u` now holds the result of the `dsu.find(u)` operation for the next tuple `(w, u, v)` in the `edges` list, while `parent_v` remains undetermined. The `edges` list and its properties remain unchanged.
