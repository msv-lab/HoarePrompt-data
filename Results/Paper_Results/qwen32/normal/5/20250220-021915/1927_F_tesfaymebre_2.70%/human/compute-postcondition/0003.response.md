In the given for loop, the loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use inside the loop. The loop will iterate `test_cases` times.

At the end of the previous iteration, `test_cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `test_cases` <= 10^4. Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, we only need to consider how `test_cases` affects the loop's continuation.

The loop will continue to execute as long as the number of iterations performed is less than `test_cases`. Each iteration of the loop implicitly decreases the remaining number of iterations by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the loop variable `_` does not need to be adjusted (since it is not used), but conceptually, the number of remaining iterations is reduced by 1.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `test_cases` should be decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 0 < `test_cases` <= 10^4**
