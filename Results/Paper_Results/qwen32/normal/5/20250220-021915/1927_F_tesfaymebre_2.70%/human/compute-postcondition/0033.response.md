Postcondition: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges; `parent_u` is the root parent of node `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method; `parent_v` is the root parent of node `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method. The current value of `parent_u` is equal to the current value of `parent_v`. If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, then `_min_edge` is assigned the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `node_u` is assigned the value of `u`, and `node_v` is assigned the value of `v`. Otherwise, the values of `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` remain unchanged.**
