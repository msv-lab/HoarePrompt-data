You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph respectively, where 3 <= n <= m <= min((n*(n - 1))/2, 2 * 10^5).
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()`, where 3 <= n <= m <= min((n*(n - 1))/2, 2 * 10^5); `graph` is a defaultdict of lists with each node having a list of adjacent nodes; `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects; `m` iterations have completed; `i` is `m-1`; `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration; all edges specified by the `func_3()` calls have been added to `graph` and `edges`.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: All edges have been processed, and the graph is fully connected if possible. The DSU structure reflects the connected components of the graph. The variables `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` hold the information about the edge with the minimum weight in the last merged component.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: _min_edge (where _min_edge is the edge with the minimum weight in the last merged component), len(res) (where len(res) is the number of nodes in the graph)
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: node1 node2 node3 ... nodeN (where node1, node2, ..., nodeN are the nodes in the graph visited during the DFS traversal)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_6` accepts parameters `n` and `m`, which are integers representing the number of vertices and edges in a graph respectively, with constraints 3 <= n <= m <= min((n*(n - 1))/2, 2 * 10^5). The function returns a value (or performs an action) based on these inputs, but the specific return value or action is not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
