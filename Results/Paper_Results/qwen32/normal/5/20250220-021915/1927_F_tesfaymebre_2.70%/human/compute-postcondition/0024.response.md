Postcondition: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path taken in the DFS traversal and now includes `curr` as its last element, the color of the current vertex (`colors[curr]`) is 1, `graph[curr]` must have at least one neighbor, and `nei` is `next_nei`, where `next_nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in `graph[curr]` that meets the conditions (`colors[next_nei] != 2` and `next_nei != parent`). If `colors[nei] != 2` and `nei != parent`, the `dfs` function is called with `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent vertex, and the updated `path`. The result `res` from the `dfs` function is converted to a set `set_res`. If `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `set_res`, the program returns `res`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.**
