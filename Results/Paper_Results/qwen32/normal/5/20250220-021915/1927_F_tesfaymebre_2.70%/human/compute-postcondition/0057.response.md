Output State: **All edges have been processed, and the graph is fully connected if possible. The DSU structure reflects the connected components of the graph. The variables `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` hold the information about the edge with the minimum weight in the last merged component.**

**Natural Language Explanation:**

After all iterations of the loop have completed, every edge in the `edges` list has been processed. The Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure (`dsu`) now accurately represents the connected components of the graph. If the graph is fully connected, all nodes will belong to the same component. The variables `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` store the details of the edge with the smallest weight that was part of the last union operation that merged two components. If no such edge was found during the last union, these variables retain their previous values. The `edges` list will be empty, and the loop will have terminated.
