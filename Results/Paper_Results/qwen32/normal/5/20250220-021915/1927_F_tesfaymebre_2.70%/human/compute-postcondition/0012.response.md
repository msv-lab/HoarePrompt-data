Postcondition: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path taken in the DFS traversal and now includes `curr` as its last element, and the color of the current vertex (`colors[curr]`) is 1. `graph[curr]` must have at least one neighbor. If `nei` is a neighbor of `curr` such that the color of `nei` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, then `res` is assigned the result of the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, and `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. The condition `res and node_v in set_res` is false, meaning either `res` is empty or `node_v` is not in `set_res`. If `nei` does not meet the condition (`colors[nei] != 2` and `nei != parent`), no changes are made to `res` or `set_res`.**
