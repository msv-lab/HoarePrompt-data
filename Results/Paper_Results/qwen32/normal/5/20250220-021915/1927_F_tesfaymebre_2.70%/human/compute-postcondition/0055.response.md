Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges, with the first tuple removed; `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)` for the next tuple `(w, u, v)` in the list; `parent_v` is the result of `dsu.find(v)` for the same tuple `(w, u, v)`; the union of the sets containing `u` and `v` has been performed in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure.**

In simpler terms, the union operation has been performed on the sets containing nodes `u` and `v` in the DSU structure, while the other variables (`edges`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v`) remain unchanged.
