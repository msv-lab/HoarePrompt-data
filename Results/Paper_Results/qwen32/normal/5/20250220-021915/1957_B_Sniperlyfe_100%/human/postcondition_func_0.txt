The function takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element of `nums` is calculated as \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k\). The subsequent elements are the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k` until `k` is reduced to 0. The rest of the elements in the list are filled with 0.
