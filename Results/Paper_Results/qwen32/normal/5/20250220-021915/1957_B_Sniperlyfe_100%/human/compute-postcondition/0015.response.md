Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n > 1\), `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `k > 0`, then `nums[i]` is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` and `k` is decreased by `nums[i]`. If `k <= 0`, `nums[i]` and `k` remain unchanged.**
