The value of `n` is assigned the value of the integer input. The values of `t`, `num_tests`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is an input integer minus 1; `n` is the input integer; and there is a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
