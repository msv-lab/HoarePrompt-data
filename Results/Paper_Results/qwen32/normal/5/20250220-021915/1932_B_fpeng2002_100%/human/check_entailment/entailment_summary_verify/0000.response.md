Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it to the problem description and the provided function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign must occur sequentially, starting from the year immediately after the previous sign's occurrence.
- Each sign occurs periodically every `a_i` years.

### Program Analysis:
- The program initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the starting point for the first sign.
- For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by:
  - Dividing `start_year` by the periodicity `nums[x]` and adding 1 to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly after `start_year`.
  - Multiplying the result by `nums[x]` to get the exact year the sign will occur.
- After processing all signs, the final value of `start_year` is printed, representing the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

### Function Summary Recap:
- The summary states that the function calculates and prints the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of integers provided as input.

### Evaluation:
- The program does not calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the list of integers. Instead, it calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the sequential nature of the signs.
- The logic in the program correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs by ensuring each subsequent sign starts its countdown from the year immediately after the previous sign's occurrence.
- The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program, confirming that the logic is accurate.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description.
- The function summary is inaccurate in this context because the program does not calculate the LCM of the list of integers. Instead, it calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the sequential nature of the signs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
