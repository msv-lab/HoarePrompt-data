The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user input to the variable `n`. The values of `start_year` and `num_tests` remain unchanged. `start_year` is still the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers in the `nums` list, and `num_tests` is still one less than its previous value and must still be greater than 0.

Output State: **`start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers in the `nums` list, `num_tests` is one less than its previous value and must still be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**
