The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The values of `t`, `num_tests`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is now represented by the new list `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is an input integer minus 1; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6.**
