To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `num_tests > 0` is satisfied. The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. 

Given that `num_tests` is an input integer, we need to ensure that it is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since the problem statement specifies that `num_tests` is an integer, we need to make sure it is explicitly set to a value greater than 0.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `num_tests` is an input integer and `num_tests` must be greater than 0**
