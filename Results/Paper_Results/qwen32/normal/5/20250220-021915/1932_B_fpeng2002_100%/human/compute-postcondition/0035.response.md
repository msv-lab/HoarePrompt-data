The code modifies the value of `start_year` based on the current value of `start_year` and the value at the new index `x` in the list `nums`. The value of `x` is incremented before this operation, so `start_year` is now `nums[x]` from the previous state, and `x` has been incremented by 1. The new value of `start_year` is calculated as `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

Given that `start_year` is initially `nums[x]` and `x` is incremented, the new `start_year` can be understood as follows:
- `start_year // nums[x]` computes the integer division of the old `start_year` by `nums[x]`.
- Adding 1 to this result and then multiplying by `nums[x]` effectively rounds `start_year` up to the next multiple of `nums[x]`.

Output State: **`start_year` is the next multiple of `nums[x]` greater than or equal to the previous `start_year`, `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is `x + 1`.**
