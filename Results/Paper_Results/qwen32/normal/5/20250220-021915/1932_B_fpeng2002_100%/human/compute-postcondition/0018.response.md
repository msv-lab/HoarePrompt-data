The code snippet sets `start_year` to 0. This changes the value of `start_year` from the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers in the `nums` list to 0. The values of `num_tests`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start_year` is 0, `num_tests` is one less than its previous value and must still be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.**
