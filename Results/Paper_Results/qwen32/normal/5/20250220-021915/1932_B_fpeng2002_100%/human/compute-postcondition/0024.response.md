The code snippet modifies the value of `start_year` by recalculating it based on its current value and the value of `nums[x]`. The values of `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start_year` is `((start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x])`, `num_tests` is one less than its previous value and must still be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is `x`.**

In simpler terms, `start_year` is recalculated to be the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`. The other variables remain unchanged.
