The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range function's parameters, which are `0` and `len(nums)`. Therefore, we can only adjust `x` for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is `0`. Since `x` is the loop variable and it gets incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be `1`.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted. The range function's parameters (`0` and `len(nums)`) remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is an input integer minus 1; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 and must have at least one element; `start_year` is `nums[0]`; `x` is 1**
