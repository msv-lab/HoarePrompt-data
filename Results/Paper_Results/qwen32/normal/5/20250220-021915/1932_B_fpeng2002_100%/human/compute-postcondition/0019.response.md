To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`. This means that the only variables we can adjust are `x` and `nums`.

Given the current state:
- `start_year` is 0.
- `num_tests` is one less than its previous value and must still be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.

For the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least one element because `range(0, len(nums))` requires `len(nums)` to be greater than 0.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- `nums` must be a list with at least one integer.
- `x` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts; it will be initialized by the `range` function.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
State: **`start_year` is 0, `num_tests` is one less than its previous value and must still be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 integer**.
