Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is an input integer minus 1; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 and must have at least one element; `start_year` is `nums[0]`; `x` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `start_year` is updated to `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Since `start_year` was initially 0, this simplifies to `(0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`, which is `nums[0]`. The value of `x` remains 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
