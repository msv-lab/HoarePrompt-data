The code snippet assigns the value of `a[0]` to `last_year`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `last_year` is now the first element of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2*n + 4 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by the original `n`, then decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the string representation of `last_year` before the code snippet, and the second being the string representation of `last_year` after the code snippet; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]; `last_year` is the value of `a[0]`.**
