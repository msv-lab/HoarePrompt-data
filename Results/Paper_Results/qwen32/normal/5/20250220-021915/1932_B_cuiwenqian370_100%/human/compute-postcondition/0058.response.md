The code snippet provided writes the contents of the `results` list to the standard output, with each element of the list on a new line, followed by an additional newline character.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `data`, `index`, `T`, `results`, `a`, and `last_year` remain unchanged by this code snippet as it only affects the output and does not modify any of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1 from the last test case; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is the position right after the last test case's data in `data`; `T` is 0; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` for each test case; `a` is a list of integers from the last test case; `last_year` is the final calculated value for the last test case. The results list has been printed to standard output with each element on a new line, followed by an additional newline character.**
