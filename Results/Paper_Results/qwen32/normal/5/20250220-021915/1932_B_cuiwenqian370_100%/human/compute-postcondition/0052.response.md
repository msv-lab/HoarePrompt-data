The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`, starting from `i = 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2 (assuming `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration).

The state of `n` does not change; it remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2*n + 4 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by the original `n`, then decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the string representation of `last_year` before the code snippet, and the second being the string representation of `last_year` after the code snippet; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]; `last_year` is the value of `next_year`; `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`; `i` is 2**
