Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse occurs, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur in sequence. Specifically, if the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the (i+1)-th sign must occur in a year `y` such that `y > x` and `y` is a multiple of the period of the (i+1)-th sign.

### Code Analysis
The provided code reads multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.
3. It initializes `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
4. For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year (`next_year`) in which the sign will occur using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
5. It updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues this process for all signs.
6. It stores the result for each test case and prints all results at the end.

### Formula Analysis
The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` can be simplified to `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`. Here's why:
- `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i]` computes the smallest integer `k` such that `k * a[i] >= last_year + a[i]`.
- Multiplying `k` by `a[i]` gives the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + a[i]`, which is equivalent to the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.

### Verification with Example
Let's verify the code with the provided example:

**First Test Case:**
- Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- Calculation:
  - `last_year = 3`
  - `next_year = (3 + 2) // 2 * 2 = 4` (second sign)
  - `next_year = (4 + 4) // 4 * 4 = 8` (third sign)
  - `next_year = (8 + 5) // 5 * 5 = 10` (fourth sign)
  - `next_year = (10 + 9) // 9 * 9 = 18` (fifth sign)
  - `next_year = (18 + 18) // 18 * 18 = 36` (sixth sign)
- Output: `36`

This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion
The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the sequential occurrence of signs and calculates the correct year for the n-th sign to occur. The formula used ensures that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one and at the next multiple of its periodicity.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
