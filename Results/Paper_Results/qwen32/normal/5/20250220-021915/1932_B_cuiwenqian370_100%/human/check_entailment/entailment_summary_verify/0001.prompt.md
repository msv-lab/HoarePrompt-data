You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        last_year = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        results.append(str(last_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a final value based on the provided integers and outputs the result for each test case, one per line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through this list to extract the number of test cases `T` and, for each test case, the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates over the remaining signs (from the second to the `n`-th sign).
   - For each sign `i`, it calculates the year `next_year` in which this sign will occur. This is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - After calculating `next_year`, it updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues to the next sign.
   
3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it stores the results in a list and prints them, each on a new line.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is strictly greater than the year the previous sign occurred. This ensures that the signs occur sequentially as required. The output for each test case is correctly computed and printed.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
