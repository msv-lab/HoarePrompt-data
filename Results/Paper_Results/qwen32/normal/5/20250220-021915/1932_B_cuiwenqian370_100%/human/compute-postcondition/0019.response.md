The code updates the value of `next_year` based on the given formula. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `next_year` is calculated as `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, where `i` is 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 2 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `a` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is the integer value of `data[index + i - 2]` for 1 <= i <= n; `last_year` is `((a[0] + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1] + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1]`; `next_year` is `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])`; `i` is 2**.
