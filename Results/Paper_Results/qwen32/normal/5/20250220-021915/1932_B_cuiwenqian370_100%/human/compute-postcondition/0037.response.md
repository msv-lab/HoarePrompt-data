Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2*n + 3`; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `last_year`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is `(last_year + a[3]) // a[3] * a[3]`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[3]) // a[3] * a[3]`; `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `last_year` has been updated to be equal to `next_year`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
