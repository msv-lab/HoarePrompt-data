The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 2 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `a` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is the integer value of `data[index + i - 2]` for 1 <= i <= n; `last_year` is `((a[0] + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1] + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1]`; `next_year` is `((a[0] + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1] + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1]`; `i` is 2**
