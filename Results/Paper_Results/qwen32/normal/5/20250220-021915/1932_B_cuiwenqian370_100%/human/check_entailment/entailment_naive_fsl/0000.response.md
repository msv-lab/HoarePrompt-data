Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The code reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.
3. It initializes the `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
4. For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year (`next_year`) in which the sign will occur based on the `last_year` and the current sign's periodicity `a[i]`. The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the `last_year` and at the next multiple of `a[i]`.
5. It updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues this process for all signs.
6. Finally, it stores the result for each test case and prints all results at the end.

The code correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs as described in the problem statement. It also handles the edge cases such as:
- When all signs have the same periodicity.
- When the number of signs is 1.
- When the periodicities are large numbers.

Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases as per the problem description.
