Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the variable `results` has been initialized as an empty list, while all other variables retain their initial values.
