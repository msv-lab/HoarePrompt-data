The code snippet `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` updates the list `a` by mapping the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n` to integers.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is 2 + n + 1.
- `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by 1.
- `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `last_year`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is the integer value of `data[index + i - 3]` for 1 <= i <= n.
- `last_year` is the value obtained after the loop completes all iterations, calculated as `last_year = ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]` after the last iteration.

After executing the code snippet, the list `a` is updated to contain the integer values from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2 + n + 1; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `last_year`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `last_year` is the value obtained after the loop completes all iterations, calculated as `last_year = ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]` after the last iteration.**
