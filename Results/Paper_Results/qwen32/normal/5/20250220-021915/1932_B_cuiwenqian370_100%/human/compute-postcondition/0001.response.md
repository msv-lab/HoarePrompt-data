The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. This affects the variable `data`, which is not mentioned in the initial state but is introduced by the code. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not directly modified by this line of code, but they are implied to be part of the input that gets split into `data`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.**
