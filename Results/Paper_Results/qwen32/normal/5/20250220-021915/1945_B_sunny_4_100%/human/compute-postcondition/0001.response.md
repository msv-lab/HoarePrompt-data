Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `m` ≤ 10^18, `A` is calculated as `int(m/a) + 1`, and `B` is calculated as `int(m/b) + 1`. The sum `A + B` is printed for each test case.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to an integer input by the user, while the values of `a`, `b`, `m`, `A`, and `B` remain as described in the initial state. The sum `A + B` is to be printed for each test case, but this action has not yet been executed in the provided code snippet.
