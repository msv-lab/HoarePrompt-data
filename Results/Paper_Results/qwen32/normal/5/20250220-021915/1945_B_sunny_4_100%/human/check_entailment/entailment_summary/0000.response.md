Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time based on the problem description. The logic in the program is flawed as it simply adds `2` to the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period, which does not account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods.

The correct approach involves determining the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period (`m + 1` minutes) and then considering the overlap of their visibility periods. The overlap can be determined using the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the periodicity of overlapping fireworks. The correct formula involves calculating the number of fireworks launched by each installation and the number of overlapping fireworks, then combining these counts properly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        A = (m // a) + 1  # Number of fireworks from the first installation
        B = (m // b) + 1  # Number of fireworks from the second installation
        AB = (m // lcm_ab) + 1  # Number of overlapping fireworks
        ans = A + B - AB  # Correct formula considering overlap
        print(ans)

func()
```

However, the given program uses `m // a + m // b + 2`, which is incorrect and does not account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods.

Correctness: **False**
