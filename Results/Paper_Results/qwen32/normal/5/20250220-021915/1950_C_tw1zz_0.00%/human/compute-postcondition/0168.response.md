Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is ''; `h1` is '09'; `m1` is the minute part of the input time as a string.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1440 inclusive, `h` remains the hour part of the input time as a string, `m` remains the minute part of the input time as a string, `m1` remains the minute part of the input time, `time` remains an empty string, `h1` is now set to '09', and `m1` remains the minute part of the input time as a string.
