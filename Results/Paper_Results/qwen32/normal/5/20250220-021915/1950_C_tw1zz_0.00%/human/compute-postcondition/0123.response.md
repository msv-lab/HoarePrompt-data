To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions provided for the variables `h1`, `m`, and `time`. The `print` statement outputs these variables in a specific format.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variable `h1`:**
   - `h1` is determined based on the value of `h`:
     - If `h` is '01' to '12', `h1` is the same as `h`.
     - If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is `h` minus 12.
     - If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12'.
     - If `h` is not one of the specified values, `h1` remains an empty string.

2. **Variable `m`:**
   - `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time. It is given directly and does not depend on any conditions.

3. **Variable `time`:**
   - `time` is determined based on the value of `h`:
     - If `h` is '01' to '11', `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '12', `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is '13' to '23', `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is '00', `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is not one of the specified values, `time` remains an empty string.

Given that the `print` statement is `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`, the output will be a concatenation of `h1`, a colon, `m`, a space, and `time`.

Let's consider a few examples to illustrate:

- If `h` is '09' and `m` is '30':
  - `h1` will be '09' (since '09' is between '01' and '12').
  - `time` will be 'AM' (since '09' is between '01' and '11').
  - Output: **09:30 AM**

- If `h` is '14' and `m` is '45':
  - `h1` will be '2' (since '14' is between '13' and '23', and 14 - 12 = 2).
  - `time` will be 'PM' (since '14' is between '13' and '23').
  - Output: **2:45 PM**

- If `h` is '23' and `m` is '59':
  - `h1` will be '11' (since '23' is between '13' and '23', and 23 - 12 = 11).
  - `time` will be 'PM' (since '23' is between '13' and '23').
  - Output: **11:59 PM**

- If `h` is '00' and `m` is '00':
  - `h1` will be '12' (since '00' is a special case).
  - `time` will be 'PM' (since '00' is a special case).
  - Output: **12:00 PM**

Since the exact values of `h` and `m` are not provided, we can't determine the exact output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the formatted time in the specified format.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is determined based on the value of h, m is the minute part of the input time, and time is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of h)**
