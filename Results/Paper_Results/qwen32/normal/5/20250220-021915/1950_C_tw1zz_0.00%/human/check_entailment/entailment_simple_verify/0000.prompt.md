You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the input is a string `s` in the format "hh:mm". The loop converts the 24-hour format time to a 12-hour format time with an AM/PM suffix. The variable `h` holds the hour part of the input time as a string, and `m` holds the minute part. The variable `h1` is set to the converted hour in 12-hour format, and `time` is set to either 'AM' or 'PM'. The loop prints the converted time in the format "h1:m time" for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the conversion of 24-hour format to 12-hour format for several edge cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly assigns "PM" to the time "00:00" and "00:59". According to the problem description, "00:00" should be converted to "12:00 AM" and "00:59" should be converted to "12:59 AM". 

Here is an example of the failure:

- Input: `00:00`
- Expected Output: `12:00 AM`
- Actual Output: `12:00 PM`

- Input: `00:59`
- Expected Output: `12:59 AM`
- Actual Output: `12:59 PM`

Additionally, the program does not handle leading zeros correctly for hours 1 to 9 in the PM range. For example, "13:00" should be converted to "01:00 PM", but the program will output "1:00 PM" without the leading zero.

To correct these issues, the program should handle the conversion more efficiently and correctly, for example using modulo operations and conditional checks to determine the correct hour and period (AM/PM).
