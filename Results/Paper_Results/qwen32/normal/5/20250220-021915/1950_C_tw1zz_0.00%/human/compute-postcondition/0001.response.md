The code takes an input string in the format "HH:MM", splits it at the colon, and assigns the hour part to `h` and the minute part to `m`. Both `h` and `m` are then converted to strings. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time; `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time.**
