Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '01' or any hour from '02' to '11', otherwise 'PM'; `h1` is '01' if `h` is '01', '02' if `h` is '02', ..., '11' if `h` is '11', '12' if `h` is '12', '01' if `h` is '13', ..., '11' if `h` is '23', and '00' remains unchanged.**
