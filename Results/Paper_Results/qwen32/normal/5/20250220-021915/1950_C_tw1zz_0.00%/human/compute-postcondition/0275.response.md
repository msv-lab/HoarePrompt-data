Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time. If `h` is '02', then `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '02'. Otherwise, if `h` is '03', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '03'. If `h` is '04', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '04'. If `h` is '05', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '05'. If `h` is '06', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '06'. If `h` is '07', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '07'. If `h` is '08', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '08'. If `h` is '09', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '09'. If `h` is '10', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '10'. If `h` is '11', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '11'. If `h` is '12', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '12'. If `h` is '13', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '01'. If `h` is '14', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '02'. If `h` is '15', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '03'. If `h` is '16', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '04'. If `h` is '17', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '05'. If `h` is '18', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '06'. If `h` is '19', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '07'. If `h` is '20', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '08'. If `h` is '21', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '09'. If `h` is '22', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '10'. If `h` is '23', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '11'. If `h` is '00', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '12'. For all other values of `h`, `time` remains '' and `h1` remains an empty string.**
