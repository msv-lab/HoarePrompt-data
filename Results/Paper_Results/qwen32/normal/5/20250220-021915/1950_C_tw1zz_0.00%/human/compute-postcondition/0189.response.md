Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is set to 'AM' if `h` is '11' or '12', otherwise 'PM'. If `h` is '11', `h1` is '11'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12'. If `h` is '13', `h1` is '01'. If `h` is any other value and `h` is not '11' or '12', `h1` is adjusted to the corresponding 12-hour format (e.g., '14' becomes '02', '15' becomes '03', ..., '23' becomes '11', and '00' remains unchanged).**
