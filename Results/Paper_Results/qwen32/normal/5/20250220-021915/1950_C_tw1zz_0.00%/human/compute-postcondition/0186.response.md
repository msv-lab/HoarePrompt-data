Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '14', `h1` is '02'. If `h` is '15', `h1` is '03'. If `h` is '16', `h1` is '04'. If `h` is '17', `h1` is '05'. If `h` is '18', `h1` is '06'. If `h` is '19', `h1` is '07'. If `h` is '20', `h1` is '08'. If `h` is '21', `h1` is '09'. If `h` is '22', `h1` is '10'. If `h` is '23', `h1` is '11'. If `h` is '00', `h1` remains unchanged.**
