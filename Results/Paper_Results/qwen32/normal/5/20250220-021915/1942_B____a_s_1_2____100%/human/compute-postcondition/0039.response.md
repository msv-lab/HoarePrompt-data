The given code snippet updates the list `p` at index `i` with the value of `mex - a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `p` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `-1`.
- `mex` is `n`.

After executing the code `p[i] = mex - a[i]`:
- The value of `p[i]` is updated to `n - a[i]`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`; `mex` is `n`.**
