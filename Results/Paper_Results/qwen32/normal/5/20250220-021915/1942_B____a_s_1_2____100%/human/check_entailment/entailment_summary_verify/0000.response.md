### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the original assessment to determine if the code is correct or not.

#### Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

#### Function Summary:
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and outputs a list `p` of `n` integers based on the input list `a`. The list `p` is constructed such that for each element `i` from `n-1` to `0`, `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is initially `n` and is updated to the minimum value in `p` after each assignment. The function outputs `t` lines, each representing the list `p` for the corresponding input values of `n` and `a`.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment is that the code is incorrect. The main issue highlighted is that the calculation and updating of the `mex` value are incorrect. The code incorrectly assumes that the `mex` value can be determined by taking the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`. This is not correct because the `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the constructed part of `p` up to that point.

#### Analysis:
To verify the correctness of the code, we need to check if the logic for computing the `mex` and constructing the permutation `p` is correct.

1. **Initialization of `mex`**:
   - The `mex` is initialized to `n`. This is a reasonable starting point because the `mex` of an empty array is `0`, and `n` is larger than any possible value in `p`.

2. **Loop from `n-1` to `0`**:
   - The loop iterates from the last element to the first element of `a`.
   - For each `i`, `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`.
   - The `mex` is then updated to the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

3. **Updating `mex`**:
   - The key issue with the provided code is that updating `mex` to the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]` does not ensure that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the constructed part of `p` up to that point. The `mex` should be recalculated by finding the smallest non-negative integer not in the set of used numbers.

#### Correct Approach:
The correct approach, as suggested in the original assessment, involves maintaining a set of used numbers and recalculating the `mex` at each step.

Here is the corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        for i in range(n):
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used.add(p[i])
            mex = 0  # Reset mex to find the next smallest unused number
        print(*p)

func()
```

In this corrected version, the `mex` is recalculated by finding the smallest non-negative integer not in the set of used numbers at each step, ensuring that the permutation `p` is constructed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the array `a` due to the incorrect updating of the `mex` value.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
