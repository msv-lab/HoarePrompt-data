To determine the output of the given `print(*p)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This appears to be a constraint or a loop counter, but it's not directly used in the given snippet.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `p` is a list where each element \( p[i] \) is calculated as \( n - a[i] \) for each index \( i \).
   - `mex` is the minimum value in the list `p`. However, `mex` is not used in the print statement.

2. **Operations:**
   - For each element in the list `a`, a corresponding element in the list `p` is calculated as \( n - a[i] \).
   - The `print(*p)` statement will unpack and print all the elements of the list `p`.

**Explanation:**
- The list `p` is constructed by subtracting each element of the list `a` from the integer `n`.
- The `print(*p)` statement will print each element of the list `p` separated by spaces.

**Output Description:**
- The output will be a sequence of integers, where each integer is the result of \( n - a[i] \) for each \( i \) in the range of the list `a`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of these variables:

Output: **n - a[0] n - a[1] n - a[2] ... n - a[len(a) - 1] (where each term is the result of n minus the corresponding element in the list a)**
