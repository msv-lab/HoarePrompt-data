The code snippet `mex = min(mex, p[i])` updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `p[i]`. Given the initial state, `mex` is initially the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`, and `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.

After executing the code, the new value of `mex` will be the smaller value between its current value and `p[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`, `i` is `n - 2`.**
