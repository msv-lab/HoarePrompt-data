The code snippet provided is `mex = min(mex, p[i])`. This line updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `p[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that n >= 1
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are -1
- `mex` is `n`

The variable `mex` will be updated to the minimum of its current value (`n`) and `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is defined as `mex - a[i]` initially, and `mex` is `n`, `p[i]` is `n - a[i]`. Therefore, the new `mex` will be `min(n, n - a[i])`.

Since `a[i]` is an integer from the list `a`, and `n` is a positive integer, the value of `mex` after executing the line will be `n` if `a[i]` is 0, or `n - a[i]` if `a[i]` is a positive integer.

However, without the specific value of `a[i]`, we can only express the output state in terms of `n` and `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are -1; `mex` is `min(n, n - a[i])`.**
