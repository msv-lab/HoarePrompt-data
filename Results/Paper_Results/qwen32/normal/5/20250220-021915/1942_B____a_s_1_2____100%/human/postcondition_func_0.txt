The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and outputs a list `p` of `n` integers based on the input list `a`. The list `p` is constructed such that for each element `i` from `n-1` to `0`, `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is initially `n` and is updated to the minimum value in `p` after each assignment. The function outputs `t` lines, each representing the list `p` for the corresponding input values of `n` and `a`.
