The code snippet assigns the value `mex - a[i]` to `p[i]`. Given that `mex` is `n` and `a` is a list of integers, `p[i]` will be updated to `n - a[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `mex` remain unchanged, while `p[i]` is updated as specified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]`, `mex` is `n`**.
