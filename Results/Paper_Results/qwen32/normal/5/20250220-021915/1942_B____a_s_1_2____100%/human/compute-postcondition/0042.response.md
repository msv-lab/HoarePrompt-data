The code snippet provided modifies the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `a` remains a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `p` was initially a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`. Now, `p[i]` is updated to `mex - a[i]`.
- `mex` remains the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`.
- `i` remains `n - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`, `i` is `n - 2`.**
