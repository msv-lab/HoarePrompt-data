The code snippet `p[i] = mex - a[i]` updates the value of `p[i]` based on the current values of `mex` and `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `p[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`, `i` is `n - 3`.**
