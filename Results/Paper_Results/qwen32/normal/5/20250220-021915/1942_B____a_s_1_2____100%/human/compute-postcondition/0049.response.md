Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times. For each execution, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The list `p` is computed such that `p[i] = mex - a[i]` for each `i` from `n-1` to `0`, where `mex` starts at `n` and is updated to be the minimum value in `p` after each assignment. After all `t` iterations, the final output consists of `t` lines, each line representing the list `p` computed for the corresponding input values of `n` and `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has run for all `t` iterations, we have `t` different lists `p`, each corresponding to a different input of `n` and `a`. For each list `p`, the value of `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` starting from the end of the list and moving to the beginning, with `mex` being updated to the minimum value encountered in the list `p` during this process. The final output is the concatenation of these `t` lists, each printed on a new line.
