The code snippet `p = [-1] * n` reassigns the list `p` to a new list containing `n` elements, all of which are `-1`. This means the previous values of `p` are overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `-1`; `mex` is the minimum value of `mex - a[i]` for all i from 0 to n-1; the loop variable `_` is incremented by 1.**
