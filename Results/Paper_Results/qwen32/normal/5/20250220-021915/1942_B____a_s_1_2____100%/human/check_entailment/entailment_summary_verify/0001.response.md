Let's carefully evaluate the provided program and its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for each element `a_i` in the given array `a`, the following condition holds:
\[ a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]
where `MEX` of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to construct the permutation `p` by iterating from the end of the array `a` to the beginning. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `p` is initialized as an array of `-1` of length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`. This is a reasonable starting point because `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer not in the constructed part of `p`.

2. **Iterating Backwards**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = n-1` to `i = 0`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.

### Correctness Verification:
- **MEX Calculation**: The `mex` variable is supposed to represent the smallest non-negative integer not in the constructed part of `p` at each step. However, the update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` does not correctly ensure that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `p`.
- **MEX Update**: The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` can incorrectly set `mex` to a value that is already in `p`. This can lead to invalid permutations where `mex` is not the smallest non-negative integer not in `p`.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
     - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - Output: `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` which matches the expected output.

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
     - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - Output: `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` which matches the expected output.

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `p = [2, 0, 1]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`
   - Output: `p = [2, 0, 1]` which matches the expected output.

### Challenge to the Original Assessment:
While the code produces the correct output for the provided examples, the logic for updating `mex` is flawed. The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` can incorrectly set `mex` to a value that is already in `p`, leading to invalid permutations in other cases.

### Conclusion:
The code does not guarantee the correct construction of `p` for all valid inputs due to the incorrect update logic for `mex`. Therefore, the code is not correct in all cases.

Final: **False**
