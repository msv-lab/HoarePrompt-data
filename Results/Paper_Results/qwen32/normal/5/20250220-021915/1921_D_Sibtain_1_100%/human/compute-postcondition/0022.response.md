Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with a length of at least 1; `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order; `ans` is 0. If `t2` (which is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`) is greater than `t1` (which is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`), then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.**
