Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order, `ans` is 0, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`.**

In this output state, the value of `t1` is calculated as the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the list `c` sorted in descending order. All other variables retain their initial values.
