You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

For each test case, it calculates and prints a value representing the minimum sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of the two lists when paired optimally.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the list `a`, and the list `c`.

2. **Early Exit for Uniform Arrays**: The program checks if both `a` and `c` contain the same single element. If so, it outputs `0` because the maximum difference `D` is `0` when all elements are the same.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order. This is a key step because the strategy to maximize the difference is to pair the smallest element in `a` with the largest element in `c` and vice versa.

4. **Single Element Case**: If `n` (the length of `a`) is `1`, the program calculates the maximum difference by considering the absolute difference between `a[0]` and the maximum and minimum elements in `c`. This is correct because with a single element, the best strategy is to pick the farthest possible value from `c`.

5. **General Case**: For the general case, the program iterates over the elements of `a` and `c` to compute the maximum possible difference `D`. The logic used here is to always take the maximum possible difference at each step by comparing the current smallest element in `a` with the current largest element in `c` and vice versa. It uses two pointers `i` and `j` to track the smallest and largest elements in `a` and `c` respectively and adds the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to the answer `ans`.

6. **Output**: After computing the maximum difference `D` for each test case, the program prints the result.

### Correctness

The logic implemented in the program is correct. Sorting `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order ensures that we are always maximizing the difference at each step. The use of two pointers to track the smallest and largest elements in `a` and `c` respectively is a valid strategy to achieve the maximum difference `D`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
