The provided code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `c`. The previous value of `c` (which was a list of integers sorted in descending order) is replaced by the new list read from the input. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `c` is a list of integers read from input; `i` is the number of times `t1` was the maximum or equal to `t2` during the iterations; `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` during the iterations; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair considered; `k` is equal to `len(a)`**
