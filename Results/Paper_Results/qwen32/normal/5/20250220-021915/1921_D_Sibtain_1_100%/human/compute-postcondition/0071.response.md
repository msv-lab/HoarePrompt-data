Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2` > `t1`, then `j` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `j` is either 1 or 2 based on the initial comparison between `t1` and `t2` and `i` is incremented by 1. `t2` is updated to `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `t2` has been recalculated based on the current values of `j`, `a`, and `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.
