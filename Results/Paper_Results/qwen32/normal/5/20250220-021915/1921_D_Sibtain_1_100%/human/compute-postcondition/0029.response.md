Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with a length of at least 1, `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is `k + 1`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2 > t1`, then `j` is `j + 1`. Otherwise, `i` is `i + 1`.***
