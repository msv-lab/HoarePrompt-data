Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input; `c` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order; `i` is the number of times `t1` was the maximum or equal to `t2` during the iterations; `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` during the iterations; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair considered; `k` is equal to `len(a)`. If `len(a) == 1` and all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same and the single element in `a` is equal to the single element in `c`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, no specific change is made to the variables.**
