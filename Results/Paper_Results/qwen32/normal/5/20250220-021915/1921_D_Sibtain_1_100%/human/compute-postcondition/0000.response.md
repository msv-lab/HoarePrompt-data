The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is a common placeholder for a loop variable when the loop variable is not used in the loop body. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`.

Given this, the only state we need to adjust is `t` to ensure that the loop can execute. The values of `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are not directly relevant to whether the loop will execute or not; they are details that would be handled inside the loop body, which is omitted in this case.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
