The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is either 0 or 1. After the increment, `i` will be either 1 or 2. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 1 or 2.**
