Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2.** 

In this state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
