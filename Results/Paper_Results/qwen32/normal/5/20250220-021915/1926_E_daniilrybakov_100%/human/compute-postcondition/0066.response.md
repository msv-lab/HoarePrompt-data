Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is the result of integer division of the original `n` by 2; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is 0; `m` is 1; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\). If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts. Since there is no else part, the only change in behavior is when the if condition is met, which results in breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
