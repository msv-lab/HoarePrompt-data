Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is an integer; `s` is \((\text{previous } n + 1) + ((\text{previous } n + 1) // 2)\); `m` is 4; `x` is \((\text{previous } n + 1) // 2\)**

In natural language: The value of `s` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
