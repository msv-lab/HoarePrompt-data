Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is a non-zero integer and `n` must be at least 1 after the current iteration's halving; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\); `m` is 2; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**

Natural Language: After executing `n //= 2`, the value of `n` is halved and rounded down to the nearest integer. The values of `t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, except that `n` is now at least 1, and `s` and `x` are recalculated based on the new value of `n`.
