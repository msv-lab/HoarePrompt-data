The code provided is `x = (n + 1) // 2`. This line reassigns the value of `x` to be the integer division of `(n + 1)` by 2. However, since `x` was already initialized with the value `(n + 1) // 2` in the initial state, this operation does not change the value of `x`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State with respect to the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` must be at least 1 (implying `n` was at least 2 before the halving); `k` is an integer; `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\); `m` is 2; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**.
