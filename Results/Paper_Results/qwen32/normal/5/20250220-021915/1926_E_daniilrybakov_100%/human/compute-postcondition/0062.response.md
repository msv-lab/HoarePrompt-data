The value of `x` is assigned the result of the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged. The precondition for `t` and `n` still holds.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` must be a non-zero integer; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is 0; `m` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
