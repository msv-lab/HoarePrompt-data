The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is 1; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`.
