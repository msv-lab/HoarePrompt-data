The value of `n` is incremented by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `n` is 3 or 4, where `n` is 4 if `y` <= `x` and `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `n` is 3; `c` is a list that contains `y` and `x` and `x` appended to it if `y` <= `x` and `a[i]` is greater than 10, or just the first element of `a` and `y` appended to it if `a[i]` is not greater than 10 or if `y` > `x`; If `i` > 0 and `a[i]` > 10, then `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]` if `n` is greater than 0.**
