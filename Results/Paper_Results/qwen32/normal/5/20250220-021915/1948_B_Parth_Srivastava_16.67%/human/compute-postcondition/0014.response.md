The code snippet `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `c`. Given that `c` initially contains `y`, after the execution, `c` will have two elements: `y` and `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is `int(a[i] / 10)`; `c` is a list containing `y` and `x`; `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0; `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`; `y` is less than or equal to `x`.**
