The code snippet `b.append(0)` appends the integer `0` to the list `b`. The variables `c` and `d` are not affected by this operation. The initial state specifies that `c` is unchanged, `d` is the sorted version of `c`, and `c` is not equal to `d`. After appending `0` to `b`, the only change is in the list `b`.

Output State: **`c` is unchanged, `d` is the sorted version of `c`, and `c` is not equal to `d`; `b` has an additional element `0` appended to it.**
