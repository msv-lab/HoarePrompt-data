The code snippet `a = input()` changes the variable `a` from being a list of integers to a string that is the raw input provided by the user. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a string equal to the input provided by the user; `k` is an input integer.**
