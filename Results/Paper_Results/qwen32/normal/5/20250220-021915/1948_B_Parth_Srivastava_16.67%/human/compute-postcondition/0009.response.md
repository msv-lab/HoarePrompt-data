The code snippet `x = int(a[i] % 10)` calculates the last digit of the integer `a[i]` and assigns it to `x`. Given that `a[i]` is greater than 10, the value of `x` will be the last digit of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is 0; `c` is an empty list; `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0.**
