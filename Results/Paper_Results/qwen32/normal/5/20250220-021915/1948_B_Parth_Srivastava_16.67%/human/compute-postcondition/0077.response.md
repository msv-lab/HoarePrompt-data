Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `i` is `i + 2`; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is int(a[i] / 10). If `y` <= `x` and `a[i]` is greater than 10, `c` includes `y` and `x` as its last two elements, and `n` is 3, 4, 5, or 6. Otherwise, `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element, and `n` is 2, 3, 4, or 5.**
