The code snippet converts the string `a` into a list of integers by splitting the string and mapping each split element to an integer. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `k` is an input integer.**
