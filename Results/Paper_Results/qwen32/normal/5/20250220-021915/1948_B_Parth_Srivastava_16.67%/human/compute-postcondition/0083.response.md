The code snippet `d = sorted(c)` sorts the elements of the list `c` and assigns the sorted list to the variable `d`. The value of `c` is not changed by this operation. The output state will reflect that `d` is now the sorted version of `c`, while `c` retains its original value.

Output State: **`c` is unchanged, `d` is the sorted version of `c`**.
