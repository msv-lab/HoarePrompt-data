The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are overwritten by the new values read from the input. The values of `t`, `ans`, and `qi` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input; `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`; `qi` is `t-1`**.
