Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description. The logic used in the program does not accurately determine the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. 

The program calculates `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2` for each test case, which is incorrect. This formula does not account for the overlap in visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find a point in time when the maximum number of fireworks from both installations are visible simultaneously. This involves considering the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the periodicity at which fireworks from both installations overlap and then counting the number of fireworks visible during this period.

The correct approach would be to find the number of fireworks launched by each installation within a period of LCM(a, b) and then count the overlaps considering the visibility period `m`.

Thus, the provided program does not follow the correct logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
