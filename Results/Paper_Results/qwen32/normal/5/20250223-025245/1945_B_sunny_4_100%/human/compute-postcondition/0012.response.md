Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input; `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`; `qi` is `t-1`**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is recalculated as `m // a + m // b + 2` based on the given formula. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `qi`) remain unchanged.
