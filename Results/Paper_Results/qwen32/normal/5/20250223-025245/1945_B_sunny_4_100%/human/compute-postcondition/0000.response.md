The given code reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, calculates `A` as `int(m/a) + 1` and `B` as `int(m/b) + 1`, and then prints the sum `A + B`. 

Since the code does not modify the initial value of `t` and only processes each test case independently, the value of `t` remains unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are read anew for each test case and are not retained after the calculation for that test case is complete. The variables `A` and `B` are calculated for each test case and are not retained after the print statement.

The output state does not retain the values of `a`, `b`, `m`, `A`, or `B` after the loop completes because these variables are local to each iteration of the loop. The only value that remains unchanged is `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
