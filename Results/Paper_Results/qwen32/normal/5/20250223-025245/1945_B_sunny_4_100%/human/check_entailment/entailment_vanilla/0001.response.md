Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Each installation launches fireworks at regular intervals (every `a` and `b` minutes), and each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the overlaps between the intervals of visibility of fireworks from both installations.

### Correct Approach
1. **Count Fireworks from Each Installation:**
   - For the first installation, the number of fireworks that can be seen within the first `m + 1` minutes is `floor(m/a) + 1`.
   - For the second installation, the number of fireworks that can be seen within the first `m + 1` minutes is `floor(m/b) + 1`.

2. **Consider Overlaps:**
   - We need to account for the overlaps between the intervals of visibility of fireworks from both installations. This is more complex and involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine when fireworks from both installations coincide.

3. **Calculate Overlaps:**
   - The number of overlapping fireworks within the first `m + 1` minutes is `floor(m/lcm(a, b)) + 1`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is the sum of fireworks from both installations minus the overlaps counted twice.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program does not correctly account for overlaps between fireworks from the two installations. It simply adds the counts from both installations and adds 2, which is incorrect.

### Correct Program
Here is a corrected version of the program that accounts for overlaps:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        A = m // a + 1
        B = m // b + 1
        AB = m // lcm_ab + 1
        ans = A + B - AB
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect because it does not account for the overlaps between fireworks from the two installations.

**Correctness: False**
