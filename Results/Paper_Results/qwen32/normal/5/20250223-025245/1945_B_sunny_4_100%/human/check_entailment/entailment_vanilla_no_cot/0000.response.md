Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic used in the program is incorrect. Specifically, the program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation up to time `m` and then adds 2, which does not account for the overlaps and the correct intervals during which fireworks are visible.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the number of fireworks launched by each installation up to a certain time and then consider the overlaps. The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of overlapping fireworks and then calculating the number of fireworks visible within the interval `[0, m]`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        A = m // a + 1
        B = m // b + 1
        AB = m // lcm_ab + 1
        ans = A + B - AB
        print(ans)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- `A` is the number of fireworks launched by the first installation up to time `m`.
- `B` is the number of fireworks launched by the second installation up to time `m`.
- `AB` is the number of fireworks launched by both installations at the same time (i.e., at multiples of the LCM of `a` and `b`) up to time `m`.
- The formula `A + B - AB` accounts for the overlaps, ensuring that fireworks launched at the same time are not counted twice.
