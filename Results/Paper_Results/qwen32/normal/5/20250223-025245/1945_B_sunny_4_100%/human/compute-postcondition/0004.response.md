The code calculates the value of `ans` using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are given in the initial state, and `t` remains unchanged as it is not used in the calculation of `ans`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are used to compute `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input; `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`.**
