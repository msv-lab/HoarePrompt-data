To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the value of the variable `ans` based on the given initial state.

Here is the breakdown of the variables and the calculation of `ans`:

1. **Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `a`: An integer (value not specified)
   - `b`: An integer (value not specified)
   - `m`: An integer (value not specified)
   - `ans`: Calculated as `m // a + m // b + 2`
   - `qi`: Calculated as `t - 1` (though `qi` is not used in the print statement)

2. **Calculation of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is computed based on the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`
   - `m // a` represents the integer division of `m` by `a`
   - `m // b` represents the integer division of `m` by `b`
   - The result of these divisions is summed up and 2 is added to the result

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the value of `ans` in terms of the given variables.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as m // a + m // b + 2)**
