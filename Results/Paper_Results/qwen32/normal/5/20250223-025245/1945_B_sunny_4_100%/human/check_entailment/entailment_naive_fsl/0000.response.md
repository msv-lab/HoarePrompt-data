Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in the way it handles overlapping visibility periods of fireworks from both installations.

Let's analyze the code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        ans = m // a + m // b + 2
        print(ans)
```

The program calculates the number of fireworks visible from the first installation as `m // a + 1` and from the second installation as `m // b + 1`. However, it incorrectly adds `2` to the result, which does not account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the overlap of visibility periods. Specifically, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine when fireworks from both installations coincide in their visibility periods.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        ans = (m // a) + (m // b) - (m // lcm)
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In the corrected version:
- `m // a` calculates the number of fireworks visible from the first installation.
- `m // b` calculates the number of fireworks visible from the second installation.
- `m // lcm` calculates the number of fireworks that are counted twice because their visibility periods overlap.
- The correct answer is then `(m // a) + (m // b) - (m // lcm)`.

The original program does not account for the overlap, leading to incorrect results in many cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
