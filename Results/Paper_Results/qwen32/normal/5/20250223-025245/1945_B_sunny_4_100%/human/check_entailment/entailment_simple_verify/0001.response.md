### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not account for overlaps between the intervals of visibility of fireworks from the two installations, which is a crucial aspect of solving the problem. The program simply adds the counts from both installations and adds 2, which is indeed incorrect.

The correct approach involves:
1. **Counting Fireworks from Each Installation:**
   - For the first installation, the number of fireworks that can be seen within the first `m + 1` minutes is `floor(m/a) + 1`.
   - For the second installation, the number of fireworks that can be seen within the first `m + 1` minutes is `floor(m/b) + 1`.

2. **Considering Overlaps:**
   - Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine when fireworks from both installations coincide.
   - The number of overlapping fireworks within the first `m + 1` minutes is `floor(m/lcm(a, b)) + 1`.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is the sum of fireworks from both installations minus the overlaps counted twice.

The provided program's logic (`ans = m // a + m // b + 2`) does not follow this correct approach. It incorrectly adds 2 without considering overlaps, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it fails to account for the overlaps between the intervals of visibility of fireworks from the two installations.

**Final: False**
