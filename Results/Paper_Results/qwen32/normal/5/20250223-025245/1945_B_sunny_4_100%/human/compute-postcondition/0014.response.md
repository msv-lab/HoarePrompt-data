Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input; `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2` for each of the `t` iterations; `qi` is `t-1`**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the state is such that `t` remains an integer within the range of 1 to 10,000. For each of the `t` iterations, integers `a`, `b`, and `m` are read from the input, and the value of `ans` is calculated as `m // a + m // b + 2`. The loop variable `qi` will have taken on all integer values from 0 to `t-1` during the iterations.
