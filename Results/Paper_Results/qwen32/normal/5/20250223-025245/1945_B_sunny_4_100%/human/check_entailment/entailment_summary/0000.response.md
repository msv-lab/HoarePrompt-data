Reasoning:

The provided program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. However, this formula is incorrect based on the problem description. 

The logic should be to determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the range of visibility (m + 1 minutes) and then account for any overlapping fireworks. The number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the first `m + 1` minutes is `m // a + 1`, and similarly for the second installation, it is `m // b + 1`. 

However, the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` incorrectly adds 2 to the sum, which does not account for the exact overlap of fireworks correctly. The correct formula would be `m // a + m // b + 1` if we consider the overlap at the start and end correctly, but even this is not sufficient as it doesn't account for the exact overlap intervals.

The correct approach would involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then using it to calculate the number of overlapping fireworks. The provided program does not implement this logic and hence is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
