Postcondition: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is 10, `i` is 1, `value` is 1022, and the current value of `value` is less than or equal to `number`.**
