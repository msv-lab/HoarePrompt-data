### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the program and its annotated version to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
- The array length must be at most 200.
- If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should output `-1`.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the integer `X`.
- It then calls `func_1(n - 1, result)`, where `n` is the input `X`, and `result` is an initially empty list.
- The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the sequence based on the input number.
- After generating the sequence, the program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

#### Function `func_1` Explanation:
- The function `func_1` takes a number and a list to populate with the sequence.
- It starts by checking if the number is zero. If so, it returns `(0, 0)`.
- It then iterates over possible sizes of subsequences, calculating the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed.
- It tries to find the largest subsequence size that fits within the remaining number of subsequences.
- It appends the calculated values to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotations suggest that `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence that corresponds to the number of increasing subsequences.
- However, the annotations and the code do not clearly show how the function ensures that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
- The function's logic involves bit manipulation and recursion but does not provide a clear mapping from the number of subsequences to the array elements.
- The function does not handle the case where it's impossible to construct such an array, which should result in `-1`.

#### Challenges and Issues:
- The function `func_1` does not directly generate a sequence that guarantees exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
- The logic of the function is not straightforward and does not provide a clear mapping from the number of subsequences to the array elements.
- The function also does not handle the case where it's impossible to construct such an array, which should result in `-1`.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_1` does not ensure that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences, and it does not handle cases where it's impossible to construct such an array.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **False**
