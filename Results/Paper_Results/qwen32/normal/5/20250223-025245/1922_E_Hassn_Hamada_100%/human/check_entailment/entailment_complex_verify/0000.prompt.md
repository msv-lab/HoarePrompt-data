You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Function `func_1` is not correctly defined or used**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the sequence, but it returns a tuple `(0, 0)` in the base case, which is not used correctly.
   - The function modifies the `sequence` list in place and returns `None`, but the return values `(0, 0)` are not utilized anywhere in the code.

2. **Incorrect handling of the base case**:
   - When `number == 0`, the function returns `(0, 0)`, but this return value is not used or handled correctly in the calling code. The base case should directly append the necessary elements to the sequence or handle the termination condition properly.

3. **Incorrect logic for generating the sequence**:
   - The logic inside the loop for calculating `size` and `value` seems incorrect and does not guarantee that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The loop condition and the way `size` and `value` are calculated do not align with the problem requirements.

4. **Incorrect handling of the input `X`**:
   - The input `X` is directly used as `n - 1` in the `func_1` call, which is not consistent with the problem requirements.
   - The function `func_1` is expected to generate a sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
For the input `X = 2`, the program might generate an incorrect sequence. The correct output for `X = 2` should be an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences, such as `[0]` or `[0 1]`. However, the provided program might generate an incorrect sequence that does not meet this requirement.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the logic and handling of the sequence generation, the program does not correctly generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
