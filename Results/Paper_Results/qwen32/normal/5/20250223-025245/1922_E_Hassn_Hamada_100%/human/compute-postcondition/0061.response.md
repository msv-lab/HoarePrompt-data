To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given information:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `size` is the first element of `size_overlap`.
   - `overlap` is the second element of `size_overlap`.
   - The condition `(1 << size) - (1 << overlap) <= number` is still valid.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```python
   for i in range(size - overlap):
       sequence.append(i + overlap)
   ```

3. **Output States After Iterations**:
   - **After 1 iteration**: `sequence` has one additional element `i + overlap`.
   - **After 2 iterations**: `sequence` has two additional elements: `i + overlap` and `(i + 2) + overlap`.
   - **After 3 iterations**: `sequence` has three additional elements: `i + overlap`, `(i + 2) + overlap`, and `(i + 4) + overlap`.

From the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can see a pattern forming. The loop iterates `size - overlap` times, appending `i + overlap` to the `sequence` list in each iteration, where `i` increments by 2 in each step.

To generalize the final state:

- The loop iterates `(size - overlap)` times.
- In each iteration, `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2.
- The elements appended to `sequence` will be `overlap`, `overlap + 2`, `overlap + 4`, ..., `overlap + 2 * (size - overlap - 1)`.

The final `sequence` will be a list of `size - overlap` elements starting from `overlap` and increasing by 2 in each step.

**Output State**: **`sequence` is a list containing elements `[overlap, overlap + 2, overlap + 4, ..., overlap + 2 * (size - overlap - 1)]`.**

In natural language, the final output state is that the `sequence` list will have `size - overlap` elements, starting from `overlap` and increasing by 2 with each subsequent element.
