Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and then prints the difference between these counts. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty, which is the main task of the problem.

The correct solution should involve finding the optimal way to split the array such that the total penalty is minimized. This requires a more sophisticated algorithm, possibly dynamic programming or a greedy approach, to determine the best splits based on the given rules.
