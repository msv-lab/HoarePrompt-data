To determine the output of the `print(P - M)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **P**: This is the count of '+' characters in the string `e`.
2. **M**: This is the count of non-'+' characters in the string `e`.
3. **i**: This variable is incremented by the length of `new_e`, but it is not used in the `print(P - M)` statement, so it is irrelevant for this specific print statement.
4. **s**: This is an input integer, but it is also not used in the `print(P - M)` statement, so it is irrelevant for this specific print statement.

The expression `P - M` calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non-'+' characters in the string `e`.

Given the initial state, we can describe the output as follows:

- **P** is the number of '+' characters in the string `e`.
- **M** is the number of characters in the string `e` that are not '+'.

Therefore, `P - M` will give us the difference between the count of '+' characters and the count of non-'+' characters in the string `e`.

Since the exact string `e` is not provided, we cannot compute a numerical value for `P - M`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the string `e`.

Output: **P - M (where P is the count of '+' characters in the string `e` and M is the count of non-'+' characters in the string `e`)**
