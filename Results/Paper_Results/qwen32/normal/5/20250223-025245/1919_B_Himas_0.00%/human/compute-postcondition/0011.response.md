The only variable in the loop head is `q`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `e`. If `e` has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is either '+' or not '+'. If `q` equals '+', `P` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `M` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `e` must have at least one more element.

Since we are only concerned with the state of `q` at the start of the next iteration, and `q` will take the value of the next element in `e`, we do not need to specify the exact value of `q` other than it being the next element in `e`.

State: **`q` is the next element in `e`**
