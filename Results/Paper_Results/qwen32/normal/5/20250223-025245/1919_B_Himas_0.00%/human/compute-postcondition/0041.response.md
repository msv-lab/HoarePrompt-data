Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `P` is the count of '+' in the string `e`.
2. `M` is the count of non-'+' characters in the string `e`.
3. `i` is incremented by the length of `e`, but `i` is not used in the print statement.
4. `s` remains the input integer, but `s` is not used in the print statement.
5. `e` remains the input string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(P - M)
```

### Analysis:
- `P` is the number of '+' characters in the string `e`.
- `M` is the number of characters in the string `e` that are not '+'.
- The expression `P - M` calculates the difference between the count of '+' characters and the count of non-'+' characters in the string `e`.

### Output:
The code will print the result of `P - M`, which is the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non-'+' characters in the input string `e`.

### Final Output:
Output: **P - M (where P is the count of '+' in the string `e` and M is the count of non-'+' characters in the string `e`)**
