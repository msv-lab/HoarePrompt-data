The code snippet provided is `M += 1`, which increments the value of `M` by 1. The initial state mentions that `M` is incremented by 1 if `q` is not equal to '+'. Since the code snippet directly increments `M` by 1, it aligns with the condition where `q` is not '+'. 

The variables `e`, `s`, and `q` remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`e` is a string with at least one character, `s` is an input integer, `q` is the next character in `e`, `M` is incremented by 1.**
