Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task requires calculating the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array derived from the string into subarrays and then calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.

However, the provided program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints the difference between these counts. This does not account for any splitting of the array or the calculation of penalties based on subarrays.

The correct approach involves a more complex algorithm, potentially using dynamic programming, to determine the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. The provided program, therefore, does not implement the required solution.

Correctness: **False**
