The value of `s` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `P`, `M`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the number of non-'+' characters in `e`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `s` is an input integer.

Output State: **`P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the number of non-'+' characters in `e`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is an input integer**.
