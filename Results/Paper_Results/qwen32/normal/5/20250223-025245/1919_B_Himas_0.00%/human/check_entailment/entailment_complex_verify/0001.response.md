### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program again to ensure the correctness assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` to minimize the total penalty.
- The penalty for a subarray `c` is `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.
- The optimal strategy involves balancing the counts of `+` and `-` to minimize the absolute sum of each subarray.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` (which is unused) and the string `s` itself.
   
2. **Counting `+` and `-`**:
   - The program counts the number of `+`s and `-`s in the string `s`.
   
3. **Calculating the Penalty**:
   - The program prints the difference `P - M` between the counts of `+` and `-`.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the program's behavior: it counts the `+` and `-` characters and prints their difference.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program **does not** implement the correct strategy for minimizing the penalty.
- Minimizing the penalty requires splitting the array into subarrays with sums as close to zero as possible.
- Simply printing the difference `P - M` does not achieve this goal.

#### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the correct strategy for minimizing the penalty as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
