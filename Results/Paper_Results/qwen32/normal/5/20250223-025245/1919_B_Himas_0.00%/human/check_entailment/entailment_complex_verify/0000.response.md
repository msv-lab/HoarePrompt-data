### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the logic required to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program simply calculates the difference between the count of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints this difference, which is unrelated to the penalty calculation described.

The penalty calculation involves splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The provided program does not perform any splitting or penalty calculation based on the described rules.

To further illustrate the inaccuracy:
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `1\n4\n++--`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - Explanation: The optimal split is `([+],[+],[-],[-])` or `([+],[+,-,-])` or `([+,-],[-,-])` or `([+,-,-],[+])`, and in all these cases, the penalty is 0.
  - Program Output: `0`
  - While the output is correct, it is due to the specific input and not because the program correctly calculates the minimum penalty.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `1\n4\n+-+-++`
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Explanation: The optimal split is `([+,-],[+,-],[+],[+])` which gives penalties of 2, 2, 1, and 1 respectively, summing to 4. However, the optimal split is actually `([+,-],[+,-,+,-])` which gives penalties of 2 and 4, summing to 2.
  - Program Output: `2`
  - This example might also produce the correct output, but it does not follow the correct logic to minimize the penalty for all possible inputs.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `1\n6\n+-+-+-++`
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Explanation: The optimal split is `([+,-],[+,-],[+,-],[+])` which gives penalties of 2, 2, 2, and 1 respectively, summing to 7. However, the optimal split is actually `([+,-],[+,-],[+,-,+,-])` which gives penalties of 2 and 4, summing to 2.
  - Program Output: `2`
  - Again, the output is correct due to the specific input, but the program does not implement the correct logic.

In all these examples, the program happens to produce the correct output for specific inputs, but it does not generalize to all possible cases as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
