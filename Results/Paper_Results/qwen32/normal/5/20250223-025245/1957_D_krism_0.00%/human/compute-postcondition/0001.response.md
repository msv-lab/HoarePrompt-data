Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer input. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
