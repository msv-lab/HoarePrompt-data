The code `prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])` appends a new element to the list `prefix`, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `v` and the last element of `prefix`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9
- `prefix` is a list containing a single element, `0`

After the code is executed, the `prefix` list will have an additional element. The new element is `v ^ 0`, which is simply `v` because XOR with 0 does not change the value of `v`. Therefore, the `prefix` list will now have two elements: `[0, v]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9; `prefix` is a list containing the elements `[0, v]`.**
