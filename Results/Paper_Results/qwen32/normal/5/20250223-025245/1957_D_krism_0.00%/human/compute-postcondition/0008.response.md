The only variable in the loop head is `v`, which is being iterated over `arr`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next value of `v` from the list `arr`.

Given that `v` is the next element in `arr` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `v` will be the subsequent element in the list `arr`. Since the loop iterates over each element in `arr`, the next value of `v` will be the element immediately following the current `v` in `arr`.

The states of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `prefix` do not change in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Let's denote the current index of `v` in `arr` as `index_v`. At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was `arr[index_v]`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `v` will be `arr[index_v + 1]`.

Since we don't have the exact index of `v` in `arr`, we can denote the next `v` as `arr[index_v + 1]` where `index_v` is the current index of `v` in `arr`.

However, since we are only concerned with the state at the start of the next iteration and not the exact index, we can simply state that `v` is the next element in `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9; `prefix` is a list containing the elements `[0, v, 0]`; `v` is the next element in `arr`**
