The code snippet initializes a list called `prefix` with a single element, which is `0`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9; `prefix` is a list containing a single element, `0`.**
