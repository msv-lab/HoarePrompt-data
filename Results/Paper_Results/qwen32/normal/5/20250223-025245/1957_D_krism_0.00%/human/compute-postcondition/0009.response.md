The code appends the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` to the `prefix` list. Given the initial state, `prefix` is `[0, v, 0]` and `v` is the next element in `arr`. Therefore, `prefix[-1]` is `0`. The expression `v ^ prefix[-1]` simplifies to `v ^ 0`, which is `v` because any number XORed with 0 remains unchanged.

Thus, the new element appended to `prefix` is `v`. The updated `prefix` list becomes `[0, v, 0, v]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9; `prefix` is a list containing the elements `[0, v, 0, v]`; `v` is the next element in `arr`**.
