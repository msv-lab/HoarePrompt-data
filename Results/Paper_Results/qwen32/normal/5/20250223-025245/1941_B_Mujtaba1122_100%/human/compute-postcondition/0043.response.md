The code snippet `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value of the element at index `i` in the list by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i - 1`.

Given:
- Initial State: The list is `[0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, ...]`
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 3 (This condition does not affect the immediate operation on the list but remains a precondition)

The element at index `i` (which is 2) is 2, and the element at index `i - 1` (which is 1) is 1. Therefore, the operation `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` translates to `list[2] -= 2 * list[1]`, which is `2 -= 2 * 1` or `2 -= 2`, resulting in `list[2]` becoming 0.

The output state is that the list is now `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`, and the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The list is `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3.**
