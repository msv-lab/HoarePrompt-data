To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior and how it modifies the list.

### Loop Analysis

The loop modifies the list based on the conditions and operations specified:

1. **Condition:** `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0`
2. **Operations:**
   - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
   - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`

### Initial and Iterated States

Given:
- **Initial State:** The list is of non-negative integers, and `n` (length of the list) is at least 3.
- **First Iteration Output:** The list becomes `[1, 2, 0, ...]`.
- **Second Iteration Output:** 
  - If `i - 1` is 0, the list becomes `[0, 2, y - x - 4, ...]`.
  - If `i - 1` is 1, the list becomes `[x, 0, y - x - 4, ...]`.
  - If `i - 1` is 2, the list becomes `[x, 2, 0, ...]`, and so on.
- **Third Iteration Output:** The list becomes `[0, 2, y - x - 4 > 0, ..., list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1], ..., list[i + 1] - list[i - 1], ...]`.

### Understanding the Modifications

From the given outputs, we can infer the following:
- The loop reduces the values at `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` based on the value at `list[i - 1]`.
- The loop continues until the conditions (`list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, `list[i + 1] > 0`) are no longer satisfied.

### Final Output State

The loop will continue reducing the list elements until `list[i - 1]` becomes 0 or `list[i]` becomes 1 or `list[i + 1]` becomes 0. Given the pattern of reduction, the loop will eventually lead to a state where the elements at `list[i - 1]` and `list[i]` are reduced to 0 or 1, and the subsequent elements are adjusted accordingly.

Given the pattern observed in the first three iterations, the final state of the list will be such that:
- `list[i - 1]` will be 0.
- `list[i]` will be 0 or 1.
- `list[i + 1]` will be adjusted based on the initial values and the reductions.

### Conclusion

The loop will continue until the conditions fail, leading to a state where the elements are reduced to non-positive or 1 at the specific indices. Given the provided outputs, the final state will be:

Output State: **[0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0]**

This means that all elements in the list will eventually be reduced to 0 due to the continuous application of the loop's operations.
