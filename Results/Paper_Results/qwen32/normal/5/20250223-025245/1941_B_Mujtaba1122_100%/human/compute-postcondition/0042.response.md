The code modifies the list at the index `i + 1` by subtracting the value at index `i - 1` from it. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so the value at index `i + 1` (which is 3) is updated by subtracting the value at index `i - 1` (which is 1).

The original value at index 3 is 1, and the value at index 1 is 1. Therefore, the new value at index 3 will be `1 - 1 = 0`.

The list initially is `[0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, ...]`. After the operation, the list becomes `[0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, ...]`.

The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The list is `[0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, ...]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3.**
