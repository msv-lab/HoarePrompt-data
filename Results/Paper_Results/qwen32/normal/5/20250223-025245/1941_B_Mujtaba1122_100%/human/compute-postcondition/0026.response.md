The code modifies the value at index `i - 1` of the list by subtracting `1 * list[i - 1]` from it. Given that `i` is 1, the operation affects the element at index 0 of the list. The initial value at index 0 is 1, so the operation results in `1 - 1 * 1`, which is 0.

Output State: **The list is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...] and `i` is 1.**
