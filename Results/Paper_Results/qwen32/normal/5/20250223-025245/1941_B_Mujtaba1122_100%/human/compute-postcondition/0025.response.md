The value of `list[i]` is updated by subtracting `2 * list[i - 1]` from it. Given the initial state, `list[i]` is `2` and `list[i - 1]` is `1`. Therefore, `list[i]` becomes `2 - 2 * 1`, which is `0`. The other elements of the list and the value of `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The list is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...] and `i` is 1.**
