### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its behavior using the annotations and the problem description.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
- We need to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using a specific operation.
- The operation can be performed any number of times and on any index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`).
- The operation modifies the array elements at positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` as follows:
  - `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
  - `a_i = a_i - 2`
  - `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function `func_1(list, n)`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if it finds any element that is not zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2(list, n)`**:
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the array from index `1` to `n-2` (since `i` must be between `2` and `n-1`).
   - For each `i`, it enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - Inside the loop, it performs the operation described in the problem incorrectly:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - The correct operation should be:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1`
     - `list[i] -= 2`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1`
   - After the loop, it checks if `list[i-1]` is not zero and prints 'no' if it is not.
   - Finally, it checks if all elements are zero using `func_1` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Operation**:
   - The operation inside the `while` loop is incorrect. It should decrement each element by the fixed values (1, 2, 1) instead of multiplying by `list[i - 1]`.
2. **Logic Error**:
   - The check `if list[i - 1] != 0` is misplaced and incorrect. It should not be used to determine the possibility of making the array zero.
   - The program prints 'no' and returns immediately if `list[i-1]` is not zero, which is not the correct approach to determine the possibility of making the entire array zero.

#### Annotations:
The annotations provided do not match the expected behavior of the program. Specifically:
- The annotations state that the operation inside the `while` loop should be `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`, which is incorrect.
- The annotations also suggest that the list should be initialized with all elements as 0, which is not the case after the operations are performed.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made zero using the described operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
