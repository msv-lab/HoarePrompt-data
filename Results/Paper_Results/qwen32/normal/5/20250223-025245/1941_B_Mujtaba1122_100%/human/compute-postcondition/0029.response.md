Given the initial state, the list is `[1, 2, 0, 0, 0, ...]` and `i` is `1`. The code snippet `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` will execute as follows:

- The value at index `i` (which is `1`) is `2`.
- The value at index `i - 1` (which is `0`) is `1`.
- The expression `2 * list[i - 1]` evaluates to `2 * 1`, which is `2`.
- Subtracting this result from `list[i]` means `2 - 2`, which equals `0`.

Thus, the value at index `1` in the list changes from `2` to `0`.

Output State: **The list is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...] and `i` is 1.**
