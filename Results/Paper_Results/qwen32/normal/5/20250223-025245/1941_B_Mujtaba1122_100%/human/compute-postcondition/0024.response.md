The code modifies the element at index `i + 1` in the list by subtracting `1 * list[i - 1]` from it. Given that `i` is 1, the element at index `i + 1` (which is index 2) is updated by subtracting `list[i - 1]` (which is `list[0]` or 1) from it.

- Before the operation, the list is `[1, 2, 1, 0, 0, ...]`.
- The value at index 2 is `1`.
- After the operation, the value at index 2 becomes `1 - 1 * list[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`.

Therefore, the updated list is `[1, 2, 0, 0, 0, ...]`.

Output State: **The list is [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, ...] and `i` is 1.**
