The code snippet provided is `n, k = func_1()`. This means that the function `func_1()` is called, and it returns two values which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`.

Given the initial state, `n` and `k` were already defined. After executing the function call, `n` and `k` will take on the values returned by `func_1()`. The other variables (`arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`) are not affected by this function call.

Since the exact return values of `func_1()` are not specified, we can only state that `n` and `k` will be updated to whatever values `func_1()` returns. The other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of length `n`, `pos` is an integer representing the index of the element `k` in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set used to store the mid values during the binary search process.**
