Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set containing `n // 2`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `mid` is `n // 2`. Additionally, `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`.**
