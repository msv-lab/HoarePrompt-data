The code calculates the midpoint between `low` and `high` and assigns it to the variable `mid`. Given the initial state, `low` is 0 and `high` is `n`. Therefore, `mid` is calculated as `(0 + n) // 2`, which simplifies to `n // 2`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `low`, `high`, `st`, and `pos` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `mid`. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set, and `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1; `mid` is `n // 2`.**
