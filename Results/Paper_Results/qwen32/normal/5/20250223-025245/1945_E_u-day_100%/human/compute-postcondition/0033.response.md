The provided code snippet sets `high` to the value of `mid`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `n // 2` and `mid`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` and `high` are adjusted such that `high` is at least `low + 2`, `high` is now equal to `mid`.**
