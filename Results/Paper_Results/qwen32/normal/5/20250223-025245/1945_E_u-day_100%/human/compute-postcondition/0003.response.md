The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones according to the code. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, since the `range(n)` function will generate a sequence from 0 to `n-1`. The other variables (`k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, `st`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given this, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The value of `i` before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted as it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop header.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `pos` is -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set used to store the mid values during the binary search process**
