The code snippet `arr = func_2()` updates the value of `arr` by assigning it the return value of `func_2()`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, `st`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is an integer representing the index of the element `k` in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set used to store the mid values during the binary search process.**
