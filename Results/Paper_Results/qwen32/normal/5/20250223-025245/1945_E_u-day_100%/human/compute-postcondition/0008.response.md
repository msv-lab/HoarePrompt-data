The code snippet `pos = i` sets the variable `pos` to the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is 1, `pos` will now be 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set used to store the mid values during the binary search process, `pos` is 1, `i` is 1**
