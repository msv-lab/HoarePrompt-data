Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- `high` is `low + 1`.
- `st` is a set containing all the `mid` values calculated during the iterations.
- `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `low + 1`**:
   - `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - Adding 1 to `low` simply shifts the index by one position to the right in the list `arr`.
   - Therefore, `low + 1` will be the index immediately following the element at index `low`.

2. **Value of `pos + 1`**:
   - `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
   - If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` is -1, and `pos + 1` will be 0.
   - If `k` is found in `arr`, `pos` is the index of `k`, and `pos + 1` will be the index immediately following the element `k` in the list `arr`.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the `print` statement will output the values of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. Since the exact values of `low` and `pos` depend on the specific contents of `arr` and the value of `k`, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **low + 1, pos + 1 (where low is the index of the largest element in arr that is less than or equal to k, and pos is the index of k in arr if k is found; otherwise, pos remains -1)**
