The code snippet `st.add(mid)` adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. Since the initial state specifies that `st` is a set containing `n // 2`, after executing the code, `st` will contain both `n // 2` and `mid`. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `n // 2` and `mid`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` and `high` are adjusted such that `low + 1 < high`**.
