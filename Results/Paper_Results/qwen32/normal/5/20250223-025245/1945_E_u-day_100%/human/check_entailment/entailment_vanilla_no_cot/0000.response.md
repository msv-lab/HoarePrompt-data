Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly address the problem requirements. The main issue is that it only performs one swap or none, as specified by the `print(1)` and `print(0)` statements. According to the problem, up to two swaps are allowed, and the program should ensure that after performing the swaps, the binary search will correctly find the target value `x` by placing it at the correct position `p_l`.

The current implementation only checks if the target `x` is already at the correct position after the binary search loop and performs a single swap if necessary. However, it does not consider all possible scenarios where two swaps might be required to correctly position `x` in the array to satisfy the binary search condition.

Here's an example where the current program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 2
3 4 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
2
1 3
2 4
```

In this case, the target `2` is at the last position, and after the binary search loop, the program would incorrectly output `1 1 4` (which is not a valid swap since it doesn't change the array to a state where binary search would find `2` correctly). Instead, the program should perform two swaps to move `2` to the correct position.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
