The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set used to store the mid values during the binary search process. If `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, `pos` is set to 1. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1, and `i` is 2**
