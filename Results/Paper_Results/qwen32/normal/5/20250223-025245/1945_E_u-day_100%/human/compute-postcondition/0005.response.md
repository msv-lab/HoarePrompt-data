The code snippet provided is:
```
pos = i
```
This line of code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `pos`. Therefore, the value of `pos` changes from -1 to the value of `i`.

Given that `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, and all other variables retain their initial states except for `pos`, the updated state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `pos` is `i`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set used to store the mid values during the binary search process, and `arr[i]` is equal to `k`.**

In simple terms, `pos` now holds the value of `i`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
