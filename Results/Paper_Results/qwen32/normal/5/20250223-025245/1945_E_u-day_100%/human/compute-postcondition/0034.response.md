The code snippet `low = mid` updates the value of `low` to be equal to `mid`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be at least 4 and that `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively still holds. The set `st` will still contain `n // 2` and `mid`, and `pos` will still be set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found, or -1 if not. The only change is that `low` is now equal to `mid`. The condition that `high` is at least `low + 2` still needs to be satisfied, but since `low` has been updated, this condition may need to be re-evaluated in the broader context of the program.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `n // 2` and `mid`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is `mid`, `high` is at least `low + 2`.**
