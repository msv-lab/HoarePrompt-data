The code snippet provided initializes a variable `size` to 1. This does not affect the values of `number` or `sequence`. The function is still expected to return `number`.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= `number` <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers from 1 to `number`, `size` is 1, and the function returns `number`.**
