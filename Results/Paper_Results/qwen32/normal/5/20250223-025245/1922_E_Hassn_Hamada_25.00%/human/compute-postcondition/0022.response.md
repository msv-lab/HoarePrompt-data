The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `size`. If `i` is less than `size`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `3` (assuming the previous value of `i` was `2` and it was incremented by `1`), `size` must be greater than `0`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by `1`, and `size` should remain the same.

Given that `i` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration, it would be `3` at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to continue, `size` must be greater than `3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`number` remains unchanged, `sequence` includes all integers from `0` to `size - 1` with the element at index `-result - i - 1` incremented by `result`, `size` must be greater than `3`, `result` is assigned the value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, `i` is `3`**
