The code appends the incremented value of `i` to the `sequence` list. `number`, `size`, and the previous state of `i` remain unchanged. After the operation, `i` is incremented by 1, and `sequence` now includes the last `i` from the previous iteration and the newly incremented `i`.

Output State: **`number` remains unchanged, `sequence` includes the last `i` from the previous iteration and the newly incremented `i`, `size` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**.
