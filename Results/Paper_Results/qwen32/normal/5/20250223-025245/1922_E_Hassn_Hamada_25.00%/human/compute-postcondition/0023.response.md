Output State: **`number` remains unchanged, `sequence` includes all integers from `0` to `size - 1` with the element at index `-result - i - 1` incremented by `result` twice, `size` must be greater than `3`, `result` is assigned the value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, `i` is `3`**

Explanation: The element at index `-result - i - 1` in the `sequence` list is incremented by `result` again, so the net effect is that this element is incremented by `result` twice. All other variables remain unchanged.
