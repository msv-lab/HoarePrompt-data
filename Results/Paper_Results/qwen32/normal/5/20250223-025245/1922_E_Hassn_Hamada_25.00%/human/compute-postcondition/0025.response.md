The code snippet increments the element at the index `-result - i - 1` in the `sequence` list by `result`. Given the initial state, `i` is `4`. Therefore, the index that will be modified is `-result - 4 - 1`, which simplifies to `-result - 5`.

Since the element at this index was already incremented by `result` twice, it will now be incremented by `result` a third time. Thus, the element at index `-result - 5` in `sequence` will have an additional `result` added to it.

Output State: **`number` remains unchanged, `sequence` includes all integers from `0` to `size - 1` with the element at index `-result - i - 1` incremented by `result` three times, `size` must be greater than `4`, `result` is assigned the value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, `i` is `4`.**
