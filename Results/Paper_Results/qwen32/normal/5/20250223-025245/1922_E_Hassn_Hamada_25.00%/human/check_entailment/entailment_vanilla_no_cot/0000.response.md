Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly generate an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic in `func_1` seems to be attempting to construct a sequence based on a binary representation of the number, but it does not ensure that the resulting array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The problem requires a more deliberate construction of the array to meet the exact count of increasing subsequences specified by `X`.

Here's a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence that corresponds to the number of increasing subsequences, but the transformation logic does not ensure the correct number of subsequences.
2. The assert statements and the way the sequence is constructed do not guarantee that the final array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
3. The example outputs provided in the problem statement do not match the logic implemented in the given program.

A correct solution would involve constructing an array in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`. This often involves using combinatorial properties and careful construction of the array elements to achieve the desired count of subsequences.
