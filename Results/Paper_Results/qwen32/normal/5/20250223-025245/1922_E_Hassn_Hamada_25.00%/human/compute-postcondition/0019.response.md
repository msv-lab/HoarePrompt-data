Output State: **`number` remains unchanged, `sequence` includes all integers from `0` to `size - 1`, `size` remains unchanged, `result` is assigned the value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**

In natural language: The value of `number` stays the same, `sequence` retains all integers from `0` to `size - 1`, and `size` does not change. A new variable `result` is introduced and assigned the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`.
