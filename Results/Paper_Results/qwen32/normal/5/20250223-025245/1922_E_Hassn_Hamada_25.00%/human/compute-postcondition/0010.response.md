Output State: **`size` is increased by 3 and `number` must be at least `2^(size + 1) - 1`.**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `size` is increased by 2 and `number` must be at least `2^(size + 2) - 1`. After executing `size += 1`, the value of `size` is increased by an additional 1, making the total increase in `size` equal to 3. Consequently, the condition for `number` changes to `number` must be at least `2^(size + 1) - 1`.
