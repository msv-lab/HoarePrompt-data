#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers representing the array. However, in the context of the problem description, sequence is not an input but an output to be constructed by the function. The function should generate such a sequence based on the given number of increasing subsequences.

    #- `size` is the largest integer such that \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1 \leq \text{number}\).

    #In natural language, the final output state is that `number` and `sequence` remain the same as they were initially, and `size` is the largest integer for which \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1\) is less than or equal to `number`.

    return size + result
    #The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a sequence of numbers based on the input integer `number` and appends the generated sequence to the `sequence` list. It returns the size of the generated sequence. If `number` is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it constructs the sequence by recursively breaking down the problem and modifying the `sequence` list in place.
