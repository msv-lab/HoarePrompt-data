Postcondition: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers from 1 to `number`, and the function returns `number`. The current value of `number` is 0, which contradicts the precondition, indicating an unexpected state.**

However, since the if condition `(number == 0)` cannot be true given the precondition `2 <= number <= 10^18`, the postcondition in the context of the given precondition is logically impossible. If we were to strictly follow the task and include the if condition in the postcondition, it would look like this:

Postcondition: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers from 1 to `number`, and the function returns `number`. The current value of `number` is 0, which is not possible given the precondition.**
