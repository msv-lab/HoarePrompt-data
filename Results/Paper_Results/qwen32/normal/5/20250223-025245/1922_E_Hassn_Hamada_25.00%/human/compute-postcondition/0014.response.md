The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `size`. If `i` is less than `size`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last value it took in the previous iteration, and `size` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `size`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`. Since `size` remains unchanged, we do not need to adjust it.

State: **`number` remains unchanged, `sequence` now includes `i_prev` at the end, `size` remains unchanged and is the largest integer such that \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1 \leq \text{number}\) and `size` is greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Since we do not have the specific value of `i_prev`, we can represent the state as:

State: **`number` remains unchanged, `sequence` now includes the last `i` from the previous iteration at the end, `size` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**.
