Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. Let's break down why:

1. **Variable Misinterpretation**: The code reads `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, where `c` should actually be `b` according to the problem description. The price of two yogurts on promotion is `b`, not `c`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation and Condition**: The code calculates `d` as `c / 2` (which should be `b / 2` if the variable names were correct). However, this does not help in determining the minimum cost. Instead, the correct approach should involve calculating the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price.

3. **Incorrect Comparison**: The condition `a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The comparison should be between the cost of buying yogurts in pairs (`(n // 2) * b`) and the cost of buying them individually (`n * a`), considering the remainder when `n` is divided by 2.

The correct approach should be:
- Calculate the number of pairs (`n // 2`) and the cost for these pairs (`(n // 2) * b`).
- Calculate the cost for the remaining yogurt(s) (`(n % 2) * a`).
- The total cost is the sum of the above two costs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of pairs and the cost for these pairs
        pairs = n // 2
        cost_pairs = pairs * b
        
        # Calculate the cost for the remaining yogurt(s)
        remaining = n % 2
        cost_remaining = remaining * a
        
        # Total cost
        total_cost = cost_pairs + cost_remaining
        
        print(total_cost)

#State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it has performed `n` iterations, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` in each iteration, calculating the total cost based on the number of pairs and remaining yogurts, and printing the result.
```

Correctness: **False**
