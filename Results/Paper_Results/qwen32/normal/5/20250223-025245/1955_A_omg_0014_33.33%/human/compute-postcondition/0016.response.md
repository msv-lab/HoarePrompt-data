The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `d`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. The output state will reflect the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 and `n` must be greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers read from the input, `d` is `c / 2`. If `a * b < a * d`, then `a * b` is less than `a * d`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2.**
