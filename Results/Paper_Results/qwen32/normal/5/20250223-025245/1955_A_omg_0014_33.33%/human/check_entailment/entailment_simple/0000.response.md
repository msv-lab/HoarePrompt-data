Reasoning:  
The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads `n` as the number of test cases, but then it incorrectly reads `a`, `b`, and `c` in each iteration of the loop instead of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `c` is not defined in the problem statement, and it seems like a mistake where `b` (the price for two yogurts) is intended.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic inside the loop is flawed. The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is not necessary for solving the problem. Instead, the program should calculate the cost of buying yogurts in pairs using the promotion price `b` and the remaining yogurts at the regular price `a`.

3. **Condition Check**: The condition `if a * b < a * d` does not make sense in the context of the problem. The correct condition should compare the cost of buying yogurts in pairs versus buying them individually.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of pairs and remaining yogurts
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        
        # Calculate the minimum cost
        cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        
        print(cost)

#State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it has read three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, calculated the number of pairs and remaining yogurts, and printed the minimum cost based on these calculations.
```

Given the issues in the original program, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
