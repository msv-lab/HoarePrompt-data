The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, if `i` was 0 at the start of the previous iteration, it would be 1 at the end of that iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers read from the input, `d` is `c / 2`. If `a * b < a * d`, then `a * b` is less than `a * d`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**.
