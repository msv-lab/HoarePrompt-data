Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves determining the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts, considering two pricing options:
1. Buying one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buying two yogurts for `b` burles.

The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

### Key Points:
- If `b < 2 * a`, it's cheaper to buy two yogurts at the promotion price.
- If `b >= 2 * a`, it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually.

### Strategy:
1. Calculate the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `n * a`.
2. Calculate the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible:
   - Number of pairs: `n // 2`
   - Cost for pairs: `(n // 2) * b`
   - Cost for any remaining yogurt (if `n` is odd): `(n % 2) * a`
   - Total cost for pairs and possibly one extra yogurt: `(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`
3. Compare the two costs and choose the minimum.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues:
1. **Variable Misuse**: The variable `c` in the input should represent the cost of two yogurts (`b` in the problem description). However, the program mistakenly uses `c` and `b` interchangeably.
2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program incorrectly calculates the cost for buying two yogurts as `a * d` (which should be `b`), and then compares it with `a * b`, which doesn't make sense.
3. **Incorrect Logic**: The program does not correctly implement the strategy described above.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Cost if buying individually
        cost_individual = n * a
        # Cost if buying in pairs (and possibly one extra yogurt)
        cost_pairs = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        # Minimum cost
        print(min(cost_individual, cost_pairs))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the misuse of variables and incorrect logic for calculating the minimum cost.

Correctness: **False**
