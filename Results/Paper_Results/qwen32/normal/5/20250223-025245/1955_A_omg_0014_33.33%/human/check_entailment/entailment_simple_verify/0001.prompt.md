You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are three integers n, a, and b where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it has performed `n` iterations, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` in each iteration, calculating `d` as `c / 2`, and printing either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` based on the condition `a * b < a * d`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained after the loop finishes processing each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves determining the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts, considering two pricing options:
1. Buying one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buying two yogurts for `b` burles.

The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

### Key Points:
- If `b < 2 * a`, it's cheaper to buy two yogurts at the promotion price.
- If `b >= 2 * a`, it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually.

### Strategy:
1. Calculate the cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `n * a`.
2. Calculate the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible:
   - Number of pairs: `n // 2`
   - Cost for pairs: `(n // 2) * b`
   - Cost for any remaining yogurt (if `n` is odd): `(n % 2) * a`
   - Total cost for pairs and possibly one extra yogurt: `(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`
3. Compare the two costs and choose the minimum.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues:
1. **Variable Misuse**: The variable `c` in the input should represent the cost of two yogurts (`b` in the problem description). However, the program mistakenly uses `c` and `b` interchangeably.
2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program incorrectly calculates the cost for buying two yogurts as `a * d` (which should be `b`), and then compares it with `a * b`, which doesn't make sense.
3. **Incorrect Logic**: The program does not correctly implement the strategy described above.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Cost if buying individually
        cost_individual = n * a
        # Cost if buying in pairs (and possibly one extra yogurt)
        cost_pairs = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        # Minimum cost
        print(min(cost_individual, cost_pairs))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the misuse of variables and incorrect logic for calculating the minimum cost.

Correctness: **False**
