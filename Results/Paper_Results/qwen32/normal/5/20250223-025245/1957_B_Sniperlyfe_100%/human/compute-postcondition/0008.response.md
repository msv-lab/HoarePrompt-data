The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. If `k` > 0, then `nums[1]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, otherwise `nums[1]` remains 0, and the rest of the elements in `nums` are 0, `i` is 2**
