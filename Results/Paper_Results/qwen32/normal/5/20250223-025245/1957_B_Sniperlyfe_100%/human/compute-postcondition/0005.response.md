Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and `nums[1]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, and the rest are 0.**

Natural Language: The value of `nums[1]` is updated to be the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the current value of `k`. All other variables retain their initial values.
