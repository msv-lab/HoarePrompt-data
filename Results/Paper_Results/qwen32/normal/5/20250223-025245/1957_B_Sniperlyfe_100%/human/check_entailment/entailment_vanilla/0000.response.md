Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
   - The sum of the sequence equals `k` (i.e., \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = k\)).
   - The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence (`a_1 | a_2 | ... | a_n`) is maximized.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of a main loop that reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using the function `func_1(n, k)`. Let's break down `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums = [0] * n`: Initializes an array of zeros with length `n`.
   - `nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`: Sets the first element to the largest number with the same number of bits as `k`. For example, if `k = 5` (binary `101`), `nums[0]` becomes `3` (binary `11`).

2. **Adjustment**:
   - `k -= nums[0]`: Adjusts `k` by subtracting the value assigned to `nums[0]`.
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n):` iterates over the remaining elements of the sequence:
     - `if k > 0`: Checks if there is still value left to assign.
     - `nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)`: Assigns the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` or the remaining `k` to `nums[i]`.
     - `k -= nums[i]`: Adjusts `k` by subtracting the value assigned to `nums[i]`.

3. **Final Adjustment**:
   - `nums[0] += k`: Adds any remaining `k` to the first element.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Sum Condition**: The program ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k` because it starts by assigning part of `k` to `nums[0]` and then distributes the rest among the remaining elements.
- **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation**: The strategy of setting `nums[0]` to the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` and then distributing the rest does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR. For example, if `k = 5` and `n = 2`, the program might output `3 2` (binary `11` and `10`), but `1 4` (binary `01` and `100`) would yield a bitwise OR of `101` with three 1s, which is better.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not always produce a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

**Correctness: False**
