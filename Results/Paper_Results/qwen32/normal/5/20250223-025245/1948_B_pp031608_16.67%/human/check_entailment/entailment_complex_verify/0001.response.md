### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program that prevent it from solving the problem as described:

1. **Single Pass Through the Array**: The program only makes a single pass through the array to check and perform split operations. This is insufficient because a split operation might introduce new elements that need to be checked and potentially split themselves. The program should use a loop that continues until no more split operations are needed or the array is sorted.

2. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program only splits an element if it is greater than 10 and greater than the next element. This logic is too restrictive. The program should consider the entire array and perform splits wherever necessary to achieve a sorted order.

3. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly checks if the array is sorted. However, the main issue lies in the logic that determines when and where to perform the split operations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting elements. The original assessment correctly identifies these problems and concludes that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
