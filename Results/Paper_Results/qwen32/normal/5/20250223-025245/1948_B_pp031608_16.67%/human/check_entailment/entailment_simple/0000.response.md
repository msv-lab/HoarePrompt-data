### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the array to check if it's sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if it is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array at the appropriate position.
   - After processing the array, it checks again if the array is sorted using `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the given list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Loop Structure**: The loop structure is flawed. The program only checks and modifies the array once per test case, but it should continue to check and modify the array until it's sorted or no further modifications are possible.
- **Incorrect Condition for Splitting**: The program checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if it is greater than or equal to 10. However, it should check if any element is greater than or equal to 10 and split it, not just the previous element.
- **Modification of List During Iteration**: The program modifies the list during iteration, which can lead to incorrect behavior because the loop index `p` does not account for the changes in the list length.

### Correct Approach:
- The program should repeatedly check the array and split any element that is greater than or equal to 10 until the array is sorted or no further modifications are possible.
- The loop should iterate over the array multiple times until the array is sorted.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
