Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from given sticks. However, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

The logic in the function `func_1` is as follows:
- It creates a frequency dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
- It then calculates the sum of `v // 3` for each value `v` in `freq.values()`, which represents the number of polygons that could be formed if each polygon required exactly 3 sticks of the same length.

However, the problem statement does not specify that each polygon must have exactly 3 sides (i.e., be a triangle). A regular polygon can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, the logic should account for the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sides.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
1. Count the frequency of each stick length.
2. For each unique stick length, determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of that stick by the smallest possible number of sides for a polygon (which is 3) and taking the integer part of the division.
3. Sum these values to get the total number of polygons that can be formed.

The provided function incorrectly assumes that all polygons must have exactly 3 sides, which is not the case according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
