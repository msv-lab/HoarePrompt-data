The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` in the list represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the stick lengths. The function calculates the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each stick length by 3 across all test cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers representing multiple test cases of stick lengths and return the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each stick length by 3.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, a list of integers where the first element is the number of test cases, followed by the number of stick lengths and the stick lengths themselves. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each stick length by 3.**
