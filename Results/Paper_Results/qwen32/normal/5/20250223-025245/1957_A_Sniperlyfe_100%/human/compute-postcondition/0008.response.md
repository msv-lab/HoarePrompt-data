Output State: **The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.**

This means that for each unique integer in the list `arr` (from the second element to the `t+1`-th element), the program calculates how many times that integer can be divided by 3 without a remainder, and then sums all these results.
