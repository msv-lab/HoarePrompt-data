Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c` respectively. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The code sorts the array `N` which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The optimal strategy should consider the counts of each number rather than their order.

2. **Counting and MEX Calculation**: The code attempts to calculate the MEX by iterating through the sorted array and keeping track of the current MEX (`cur`). However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple numbers have the same count, and it does not account for the alternating turns of Alice and Bob.

3. **Handling Multiple Occurrences**: The code does not correctly handle cases where multiple numbers have the same count. For example, if there are multiple numbers that appear exactly once, the code does not correctly determine the second smallest such number, which could be the correct MEX.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when all numbers are the same or when the array contains only one element.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness of the code:

**Input:**
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
2
0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1
0
1
```

**Actual Output from the Provided Program:**
```
2
1
0
1
```

While the provided program happens to produce the correct output for the given examples, it does not handle all possible cases correctly. For instance, the case where the array contains only one element or where all elements are the same is not handled correctly by the logic in the code.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a frequency counter and simulating the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
