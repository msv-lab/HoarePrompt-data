Postcondition: **`N` is [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]; `cur` is `cnt[1]` if the length of `cnt` is at least 2, otherwise `cur` is 3 if the sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`, otherwise `cur` remains 2; `M` is {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}; `cnt` is a list of integers; `S` is the input integer; `T` remains unchanged.**
