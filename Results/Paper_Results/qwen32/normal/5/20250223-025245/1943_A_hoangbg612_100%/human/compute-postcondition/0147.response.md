The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `k` is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, we assume `k` is a variable that holds a specific value, which is `M[k]` where `M` is a dictionary with keys 0, 1, and 2, and each key has a value of 1. However, since `k` is not specified in the snippet, we can only describe the state in terms of `k`.

Output State: **`N` is [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]; `cur` is 3 if the sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`, otherwise `cur` remains 2; `M` is {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}; `cnt` is [k]; `S` is the input integer; `T` remains unchanged; `M[k]` is 1 for the current key `k`.**

In simpler terms, the list `cnt` now includes the value of `k`, and all other variables remain in their initial states.
