Output State: **N is [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]; cur is 3 if the sum of the values in M is equal to S, otherwise cur remains 2; M is {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}; cnt is []; S is the input integer; T remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` has been reassigned to an empty list `[]`. The other variables (`N`, `cur`, `M`, `S`, and `T`) remain unchanged.
