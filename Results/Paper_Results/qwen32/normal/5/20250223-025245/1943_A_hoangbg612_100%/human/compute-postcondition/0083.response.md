The code snippet `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. Given the initial state, `num` is the next integer in the list `N`. Therefore, after the execution of this code, `cur` will take the value of `num`.

The conditions related to `M` depend on the value of `cur` before and after the assignment. Since `cur` is now `num`, the condition `num > cur` (which was `num > num + 1` or `num > 0` based on the initial state) will no longer hold true. Therefore, `M` will be updated based on the new value of `cur`.

Given the initial state, if `cur` was `num + 1` or `0`, and `num` is now assigned to `cur`, the conditions for `M` will change:
- If `num > cur` was true before, it will be false now because `num` is not greater than itself.
- If `cur` was `num` after the else, `M` was `{num: 2}`. Now, since `cur` is still `num`, `M` remains `{num: 2}`.
- If `cur` was `-1` after the else, `M` was `{-1: 2}`. Now, since `cur` is `num`, `M` changes to `{num: 2}`.

The other variables (`S`, `cnt`, `T`, `N`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`cur` is `num`; `M` is `{num: 2}`; `S` is an input integer; `cnt` is an empty set; `T` remains unchanged; `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two integers; `num` is the next integer in the list `N`.**
