To determine the final state of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the output states after the first three iterations.

### Loop Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
    - `cur` starts at `-1`.
    - `M` is an empty dictionary.
    - `S` is an input integer (not modified in the loop).
    - `cnt` is an empty set (not modified in the loop).
    - `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input.

2. **Loop Execution:**
    - For each `num` in `N`:
        - If `num > cur`:
            - If `num > cur + 1`:
                - `cur` is incremented by 1 and the loop breaks.
            - Otherwise, `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to `1`.
        - Else (`num <= cur`):
            - `M[cur]` is incremented by `1`.

### Final Output State

The loop will iterate over each integer in the sorted list `N`. The key points to consider are:
- `cur` will track the current number being processed or the last number processed.
- `M` will count the occurrences of each number in `N` as per the rules described.

### Detailed Steps

1. **First Iteration:**
    - If `num > cur` (initially `-1`), `cur` is set to `num` and `M[num]` is set to `1`.
    - If `num <= cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by `1`.

2. **Subsequent Iterations:**
    - If `num > cur`, `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[num]` is set to `1`.
    - If `num <= cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by `1`.

3. **Termination:**
    - The loop terminates after processing all elements in `N`.

### Final Output State

After all iterations, the `cur` variable will be the last number in the list `N`, and the dictionary `M` will contain the count of each number in `N`.

**Output State: **`cur` is the last number in `N`, `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` and values as their respective counts, `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, and `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input.**

### Human-readable Explanation

- `cur` will be the last number in the sorted list `N`.
- `M` will be a dictionary where each key is a number from `N` and its value is the count of occurrences of that number in `N`.
- `S`, `cnt`, and `T` remain unchanged from their initial values.
- `N` remains the sorted list of integers from the input.
