The code snippet assigns the value of `num` to the variable `cur`. This means that `cur` now holds the same value as `num`. The other variables (`N`, `T`, `S`, and the condition about `num` being greater than `cur + 1` which leads to an increment of `cur` and a break) remain unchanged unless the condition `num > cur + 1` was met before the assignment, which would have already modified `cur` and broken out of the loop.

Since the assignment happens regardless of the condition, we only need to reflect the change in `cur`.

Output State: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is the input integer, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is now equal to `num`.**
