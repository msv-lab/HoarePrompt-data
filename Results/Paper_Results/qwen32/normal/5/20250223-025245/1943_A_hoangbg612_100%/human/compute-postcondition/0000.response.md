The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the size of the array `a` as per the initial state description. The values of `n` and the elements of the array `a` remain unchanged because the code does not affect them.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from input, representing the size of the array `a`; `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the size of the array `a`; `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array `a`.**
