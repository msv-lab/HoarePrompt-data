The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value at the index `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is `N[N.index(num_next) + 1]`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
