The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cur` is 2, so after the operation, `cur` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **N is [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]; cur is 3; M is {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}; cnt is [0, 1, 2]; S is the input integer; T remains unchanged. The sum of the values in M is equal to S.**
