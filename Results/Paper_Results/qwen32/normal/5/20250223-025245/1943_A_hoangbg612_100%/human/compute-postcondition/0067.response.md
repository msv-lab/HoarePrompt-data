The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Given that `cur` is initially `num`, the dictionary `M` will have a new entry with the key `num` and the value `1`.

The other variables remain unchanged, so `S` is still an input integer, `cnt` is still an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is still a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer, and `num` is still greater than `cur`.

Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `M` is a dictionary with `{num: 1}`, `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer, `num` is greater than `cur`.**
