The given Python code snippet simply assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. Based on the initial state, `num` is the next integer in the list `N`. The other variables (`S`, `cnt`, `T`, and `N`) are not affected by this assignment. The condition related to updating `cur` and `M` is not relevant here because the provided code snippet only includes the assignment `cur = num`.

Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, and `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input with at least two integers.**
