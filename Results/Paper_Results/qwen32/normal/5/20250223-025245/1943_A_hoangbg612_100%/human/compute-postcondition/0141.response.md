Postcondition: **N is [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]; cur is 2; M is {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}; cnt is [0, 1, 2]; S is the input integer; T remains unchanged. The sum of the values in M is equal to S.**

This postcondition retains all the initial conditions provided in the precondition and adds the additional condition that the sum of the values in the dictionary M is equal to the input integer S, which is the condition that must be true for the if statement to be executed.
