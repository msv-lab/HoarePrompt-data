The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which iterates over the elements of the list `N`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that the list `N` has at least one element. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `a`, `S`, `cur`, `M`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary**
