The code appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. The values of `cur`, `M`, `S`, `T`, `N`, and `k` remain unchanged. The only change is that `cnt` now includes `k` as its first (and currently only) element.

Output State: **`cur` is the last number in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`; otherwise, `cur` remains the last number in `N`, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is a list containing `k`, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer, `k` is the next key in `M.keys()`**.
