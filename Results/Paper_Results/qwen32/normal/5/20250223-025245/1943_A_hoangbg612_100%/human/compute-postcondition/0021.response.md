Postcondition: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is `num_next`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur] = 1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1 and `M` is a dictionary with the key -1 having a value of 1.**
