The given Python code snippet is `cur = num`. This line assigns the value of the variable `num` to the variable `cur`. 

Based on the initial state, the value of `cur` will now be equal to the value of `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is set to 0 and `num` is at least 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `cur` and `num` remain unchanged. `M` is an empty dictionary. `cur` is equal to `num`.**
