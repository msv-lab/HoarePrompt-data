To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze the problem requirements and the provided code. The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation to ensure that after performing a binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`. We are allowed to perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

The provided code does not contain the actual logic for solving the problem; it only includes functions to read input. The functions are:

1. `func_1()`: Reads a single integer from the input.
2. `func_2()`: Reads a line of integers from the input and returns them as a map of integers.
3. `func_3()`: Reads a line of integers from the input and returns them as a list of integers.
4. `func_4()`: Reads a line of input as a string.
5. `func_5()`: Reads a line of input as a list of strings.

These functions are useful for reading the input, but they do not contain the logic to solve the problem. The actual logic to determine the necessary swaps is missing.

To solve the problem, we would need to:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the size of the permutation and the target number `x`.
3. Read the permutation.
4. Determine the minimum number of swaps (up to 2) needed to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.
5. Output the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped.

Since the provided code does not contain the logic to perform these steps, it is incorrect for solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
