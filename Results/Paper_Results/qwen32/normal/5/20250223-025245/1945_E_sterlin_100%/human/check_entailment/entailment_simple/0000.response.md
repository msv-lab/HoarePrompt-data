### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values `n` and `x`, and then reads the permutation `p`.

2. **Mapping Indices:**
   - It creates a dictionary `num_indx` that maps each number in the permutation to its index (1-based).
   - It initializes a list `seen` of length `n` with all elements set to 0. This list will be used to track which elements have been "seen" during the binary search process.

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - The program simulates a binary search on the permutation.
   - It initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to `n`.
   - It enters a loop that continues until `right - left` is 1.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `mid` as the floor of `(left + right) / 2`.
   - It marks the element at `mid` as "seen" in the `seen` list.
   - Depending on whether the element at `mid` is less than or equal to `x`, it updates `left` or `right`.

4. **Checking Results:**
   - If the element at `left` is equal to `x`, it prints 0 (no operations needed).
   - If `x` has not been seen during the binary search, it prints 1 and suggests swapping the element at `left` with `x`.
   - If `x` has been seen, it finds the first unseen element and suggests two swaps: first to move an unseen element to the position of `x`, and then to move `x` to the position of the element at `left`.

### Verification Against the Problem Statement:

- **Correctness of Binary Search Simulation:**
  - The program correctly simulates the binary search process by maintaining the `left` and `right` pointers and checking the middle element.

- **Handling of Seen Elements:**
  - The `seen` list helps in determining which elements have been encountered during the binary search. This is crucial for deciding the minimum number of swaps needed.

- **Output of Operations:**
  - The program correctly identifies when no swaps are needed (`p[left] == x`).
  - When `x` is not seen, it suggests a single swap to place `x` in the correct position.
  - When `x` is seen, it suggests two swaps to ensure `p[left]` is equal to `x` after the binary search.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of swaps needed to ensure that after performing the binary search, `p[left]` is equal to `x`. It handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
