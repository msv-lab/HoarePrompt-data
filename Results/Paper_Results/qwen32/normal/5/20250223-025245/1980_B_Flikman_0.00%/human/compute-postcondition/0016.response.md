Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `same_value_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `same_value_count` will hold the total number of times the `favorite_value` (which is the element at index `f-1` in the list `a`) appears throughout the entire list `a`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
