The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `ans`. This change affects the value of `ans`, but the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, and `ans` is `1`.**
