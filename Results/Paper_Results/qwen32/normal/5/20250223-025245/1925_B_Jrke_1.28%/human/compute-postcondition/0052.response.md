Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input and is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is 1, `x % i == 0` is true, indicating that `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x // i <= k`, then `l` is `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or `[1, x // i]` if `i` is greater than `k`. If `x // i > k`, there is no change to `l`.**
