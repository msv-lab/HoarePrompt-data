The function accepts two parameters: `x` and `n`. Both `x` and `n` are integers, with `x` in the range 1 to 10^8 and `n` in the range 1 to `x`. The function likely performs some computation based on these inputs. The output is not specified directly, but given the constraints, it is reasonable to infer that the function could be calculating a power, a combination, or some other mathematical relationship between `x` and `n`. However, without explicit output details, the most accurate description is that the function processes these inputs and returns a result based on them.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `n`, where `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
