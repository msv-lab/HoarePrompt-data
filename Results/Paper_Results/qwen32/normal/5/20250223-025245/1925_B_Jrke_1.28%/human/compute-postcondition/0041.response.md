The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables or affect the program state in any way. It is typically used within loops to skip the rest of the loop's code and proceed to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the provided context, the `continue` statement has no effect here.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, and `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.**
