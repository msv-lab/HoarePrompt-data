The only variable in the loop head is `result`, which is an element from the list `results`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `results` and how the loop progresses.

Given that `results` is a list containing at least one element, the loop will execute as long as there are elements left in `results` to iterate over. At the end of the previous iteration, `result` held the value of the last element that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `results` to be assigned to `result`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `results` is a list containing at least one element, and `result` is the last element that was processed.

To execute one more time, `results` must still have at least one element left. Since `result` is the last element processed, the next `result` will be the next element in the list.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least one element**
