### Reasoning:

Let's start by analyzing the problem and the provided program step-by-step to ensure everything aligns correctly.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. To maximize this sum, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. When sorted, the absolute differences between consecutive elements are simply the differences because the array is non-decreasing or non-increasing.

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(array)`**:
   - **Functionality**: This function sorts the input array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Correctness**: Since the array is sorted, the absolute differences are just the differences themselves, which maximizes the beauty. This function correctly computes the maximum beauty for a given array.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - **Functionality**: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty for each test case. It then prints the results.
   - **Correctness**: The function reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by sorting the array and computing the beauty using `func_1`, and outputs the results. This function correctly handles multiple test cases and leverages `func_1` to get the correct result for each case.

#### Function Summary Validation:
The function summary for `func_2` states:
- The function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- For each test case, it computes a result using the `func_1` function.
- It prints the result for each test case.

This summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_2` and aligns with the problem description and the provided code.

#### Test Cases:
Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided test cases:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
   - Sorted Array: `1 2 3`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`
   - Output: `2`
   - **Correct**

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
   - Sorted Array: `69 69 69`
   - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0`
   - Output: `0`
   - **Correct**

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted Array: `43 54 80 90 100`
   - Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`
   - Output: `57`
   - **Correct**

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted Array: `3 3 3 4`
   - Beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1`
   - **Correct**

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `2`, `2 1`
   - Sorted Array: `1 2`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`
   - Output: `1`
   - **Correct**

All test cases produce the correct output, confirming that the program works as intended.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array for each test case by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements. The logic and implementation are accurate.

**Final: True**
