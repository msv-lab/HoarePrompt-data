The code snippet provided is:
```
result = func_1(array)
```

This line of code updates the `result` variable by assigning it the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with `array` as its argument. No other variables are affected in this execution.

Given the initial state:
- `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`
- `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer
- `t` is 2
- `index` is `index + 2 + n + n`
- `results` is a list containing two `result` values
- `n` is `int(data[index - n - 2 - n])`
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`

The variable `result` is updated with the return value of `func_1(array)`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer; `t` is 2; `index` is `index + 2 + n + n`; `results` is a list containing two `result` values; `n` is `int(data[index - n - 2 - n])`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`**
