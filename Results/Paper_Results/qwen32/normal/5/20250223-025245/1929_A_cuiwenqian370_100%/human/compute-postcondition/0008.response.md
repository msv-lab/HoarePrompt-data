The code snippet `array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` converts a slice of the `data` list (from index `index` to `index + n`) into integers and assigns it to the `array` variable.

Given the initial state:
- `array` is a list of integers with length `n` where 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
- `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer.
- `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0.
- `index` is 2.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is `int(data[1])`.

After the execution of the code snippet, `array` will be updated to a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` is `int(data[1])`.**

In simpler terms, the `array` variable is now a list of integers taken from the `data` list starting from position `index` up to `index + n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
