To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for result in results:`. This means we can only adjust the states of `result` and `results`.

Given the provided state before the loop starts:

- `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`
- `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer
- `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0
- `index` is `index + (t - 1) * (1 + n)`
- `results` is a list containing `t` values, each being the value returned by `func_1(array)` for each iteration
- `n` is `int(data[index - (1 + n) * (t - 1)])`
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)` for the last iteration

The loop `for result in results:` will execute if and only if `results` is a list with at least one element. Since the loop body is omitted, we do not need to consider the values within the loop body. We only need to ensure `results` is properly initialized with at least one element.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `results` to have at least one element. The state of `result` is not directly relevant to the execution of the loop, as it is just a variable that will take on the value of each element in `results` during each iteration.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least one element**
