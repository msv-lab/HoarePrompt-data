The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used in the loop body. Since `_` does not represent any state that needs to be adjusted, the only variable that can be considered for adjustment is `t` (the loop counter).

Given that the loop runs `t` times, and at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must have been decremented by 1, we need to adjust `t` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, before the start of the next iteration, `t` should be 1.

State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer, `t` is 1, `index` is `index + n`, `results` is a list containing `result`, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`**
