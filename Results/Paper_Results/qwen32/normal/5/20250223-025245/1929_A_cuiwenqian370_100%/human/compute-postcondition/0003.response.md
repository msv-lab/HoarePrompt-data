The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the variable `index`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n where 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`; `index` is 1.**
