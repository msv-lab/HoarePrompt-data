The provided code snippet assigns the `sys.stdin.read` function to the variable `input`. This means that `input` will now refer to the `read` method of the `sys.stdin` object, which reads input from the standard input (usually the keyboard or a file redirection). This change only affects the `input` variable, and the `array` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n where 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function.**
