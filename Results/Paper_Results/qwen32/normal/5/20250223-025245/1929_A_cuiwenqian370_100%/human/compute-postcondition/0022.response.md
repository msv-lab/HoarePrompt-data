The code snippet updates the `array` variable by mapping the integers from the slice `data[index:index + n]`. All other variables remain unchanged unless directly affected by the code.

Since `array` is being reassigned, it now holds the list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`. The other variables like `input`, `data`, `t`, `index`, `results`, `n`, and `result` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer; `t` is 2; `index` is `index + 2 + n`; `results` is a list containing two `result` values; `n` is `int(data[index])`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`**.
