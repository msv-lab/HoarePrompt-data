Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0; `index` is `index + (t - 1) * (1 + n)`; `results` is a list containing `t` values, each being the value returned by `func_1(array)` for each iteration; `n` is `int(data[index - (1 + n) * (t - 1)])`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)` for the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The `array` variable will hold the last list of integers processed by `func_1`.
- The `input` variable remains assigned to the `sys.stdin.read` function.
- The `data` variable remains the list of strings obtained from the input.
- The `t` variable, which represents the number of test cases, remains unchanged.
- The `index` variable will have been incremented by the total number of elements processed across all test cases, including the test case count and the sizes of each array.
- The `results` list will contain the results of `func_1` for each of the `t` test cases.
- The `n` variable will represent the size of the last array processed.
- The `result` variable will hold the result of `func_1` for the last array processed.
