The value of `n` is updated to be the integer value of `data[index]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer, `t` is 1, `index` is `index + n`, `results` is a list containing `result`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`**.
