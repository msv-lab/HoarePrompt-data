The given Python code snippet appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. 

Here is the impact on the variables:
- `results` is initially an empty list. After the code snippet, `results` will contain one element, which is the value of `result`.
- All other variables (`array`, `input`, `data`, `t`, `index`, `n`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `index` is `index + n`, `results` is a list containing `result`, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`**.
