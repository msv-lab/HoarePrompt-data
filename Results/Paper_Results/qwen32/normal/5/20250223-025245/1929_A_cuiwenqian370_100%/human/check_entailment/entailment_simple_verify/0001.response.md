Let's analyze the program and the annotations to verify the correctness of the given solution.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. By sorting the array in ascending or descending order, the beauty is maximized because the differences between consecutive elements will be as large as possible.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(array)`: Sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
2. `func_2()`: Reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty for each test case.

### Annotations Analysis
Annotations provide insights into the state of the program at key points:
- In `func_1`, the array is correctly sorted, and the beauty is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- In `func_2`, the input is correctly read, processed, and the results are stored and printed.

### Verification
1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which aligns with the problem's goal.
2. **Calculating Beauty**: The beauty calculation in `func_1` is correct, as it sums the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input, processing each case, and printing the results.

### Conclusion
The logic in both functions is correct and aligns with the problem description. The annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected at key points, and the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
