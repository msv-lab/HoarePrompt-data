To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the `results` list. The loop iterates over the `results` list and prints each element. The number of iterations is determined by the length of the `results` list, which in turn is determined by the value of `t` (the number of iterations specified in the input).

Given that the loop has executed 3 times, we know that `results` contains at least 3 elements. Since the loop iterates over each element in `results` and prints it, after all iterations, all elements in `results` will have been printed.

Thus, the output state after all iterations will be that all `t` elements in `results` have been printed.

Output State: **All elements in the `results` list have been printed.**
