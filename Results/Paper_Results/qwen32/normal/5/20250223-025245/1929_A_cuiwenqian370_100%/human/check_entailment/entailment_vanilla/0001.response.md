Reasoning: 
The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of an array, where beauty is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array in either ascending or descending order. This is because the sum of differences between consecutive elements will be maximized when the differences themselves are maximized, which occurs when the array is sorted in one of these orders.

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(array)`: This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted, the absolute differences are simply the differences (as the array is either non-decreasing or non-increasing). This function correctly calculates the maximum beauty for a given array.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty for each test case. It then prints the results.

The logic in both functions is correct and aligns with the problem description. The program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by sorting the array and computing the beauty, and outputs the results correctly.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
