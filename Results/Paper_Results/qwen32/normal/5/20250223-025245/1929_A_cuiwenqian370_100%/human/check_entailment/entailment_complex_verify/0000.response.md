### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key strategy for maximizing the beauty of the array: sorting the array. The sorted order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the beauty as defined in the problem statement.

Let's break down the code and annotations to verify this reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - **State Before Function Call**: The `array` is a list of integers with a length `n` such that `2 <= n <= 100`, and each integer in the array satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.
   - **Sorting**: The array is sorted in ascending order. This is crucial because sorting maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty is calculated by iterating through the sorted array and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted, `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` simplifies to `array[i] - array[i - 1]` because `array[i]` is always greater than or equal to `array[i - 1]`.
   - **State After Function Call**: The `array` is sorted, and `beauty` is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The function returns this `beauty` value.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. It processes each test case by reading the number of elements `n` and then reading the `n` integers that form the array.
   - **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it calls `func_1(array)` to compute the beauty of the array and stores the result.
   - **Output**: After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, such as before and after sorting the array, and before and after calculating the beauty.
   - The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` correctly computes the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

4. **Verification with Example Cases**:
   - The example cases provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program, as shown in the original assessment.
   - The calculations for each test case align with the expected results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy of sorting the array to maximize the beauty. The annotations and the example cases confirm that the program behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: **True**
