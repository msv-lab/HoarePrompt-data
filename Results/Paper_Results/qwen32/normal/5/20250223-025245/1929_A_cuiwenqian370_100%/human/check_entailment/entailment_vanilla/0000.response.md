### Reasoning:
To determine the maximum beauty of the array, we need to maximize the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. The key insight here is that the maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the array in either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Sorting the Array:** By sorting the array, we ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is because the difference between consecutive elements in a sorted array will be larger than in any other arrangement.

2. **Calculating Beauty:** After sorting the array, we can calculate the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted, we can simply add up the differences `array[i] - array[i-1]` for `i` from 2 to `n` (since the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, the absolute value is not necessary).

3. **Function `func_1`:** This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty as described. It iterates through the sorted array and sums up the differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Function `func_2`:** This function reads the input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements, processes the array using `func_1`, and stores the result. Finally, it prints all the results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and summing up the differences between consecutive elements. Therefore, the program is correct.
