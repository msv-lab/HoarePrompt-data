Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

**Initial State:**
- `results` is a list containing at least two elements.
- `result` is the second element in the list `results`.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print(result)
```

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**
1. From the initial state, we know that `results` is a list with at least two elements. This means the list could look something like `[x, y, ...]`, where `x` and `y` can be any values.
2. The variable `result` is explicitly defined as the second element in the `results` list. Therefore, `result` is `results[1]`. Using the example list `[x, y, ...]`, `result` would be `y`.

Since the exact values of the elements in the `results` list are not specified, we can only describe the value of `result` in terms of its position in the list.

**Output Description:**
The `print(result)` statement will print the second element of the `results` list.

**Final Output:**
Output: **result (where result is the second element in the list `results`)**
