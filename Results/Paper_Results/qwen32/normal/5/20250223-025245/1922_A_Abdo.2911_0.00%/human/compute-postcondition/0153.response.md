Output State: **`match_a_b` is False if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` and `template[i]` is lowercase, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value; `match_c` is False; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
