The code snippet appends the character `a[i]` to the list `template`. Given that `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` at the current index `i`, the value of `template` will now include this character. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list containing the character `a[i]`; at the current index `i`, `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`.**
