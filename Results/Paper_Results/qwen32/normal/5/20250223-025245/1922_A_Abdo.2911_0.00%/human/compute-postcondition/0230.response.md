Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all `n` iterations without setting `match_a_b` to `False`. `match_c` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, otherwise `match_c` remains `True`. The current value of `_` is `current_value_of_ + n` and is less than `t`. `n` is greater than 0. `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same. `template` remains the same. `template[i]` is a lowercase letter. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, the most internal loop is broken out of.**
