Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`; otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True. `match_c` is True throughout. `_` is the current value of `_` plus `n` and `_` is less than `t`. `n` is greater than 0. `a`, `b`, and `c` are stripped input strings. `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`. The current element `template[i]` is lowercase. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
