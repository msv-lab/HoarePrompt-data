Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `True` if for all `i` in the range of `n`, `template[i]` is lowercase and both `a[i] == template[i]` and `b[i] == template[i]`, or `template[i]` is uppercase and neither `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` nor `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` is `False`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 0; `template[i]` is lowercase; `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`.**
