Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`. If `a[i] != template[i]` or `b[i] != template[i]`, `match_a_b` is set to False and the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains unchanged and `i` is incremented by 1.**
