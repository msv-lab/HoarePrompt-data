Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all `n` iterations without setting `match_a_b` to `False`; `match_c` is `True`; `_` is `current_value_of_ + n` and `_` is less than `t`; `n` remains the same; `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same; `template` remains the same.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all `n` iterations without setting `match_a_b` to `False`. `match_c` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is lowercase, or if `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not lowercase. The current value of `_` is `current_value_of_ + n` and is less than `t`. `n` is greater than 0. `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same. `template` remains the same. If `c[i]` does not match `template[i]` according to the conditions, the most internal loop is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all `n` iterations without setting `match_a_b` to `False`. `match_c` is `False` if `c[i]` does not match `template[i]` according to the given conditions. `_` is `current_value_of_ + n` and is less than `t`. `n` is greater than 0. `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same. `template` remains the same. `i` is 4. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, or if `template[i]` is not lowercase and `c[i].lower()` is not equal to `template[i].lower()`, the most internal loop is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all `n` iterations without setting `match_a_b` to `False`. `match_c` is `False` if `c[i]` does not match `template[i]` according to the given conditions. `_` is `current_value_of_ + n` and is less than `t`. `n` is greater than 0. `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same. `template` remains the same. `i` is 5. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i] != template[i]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `template[i]` is not lowercase and `c[i].lower() != template[i].lower()`, `match_c` is set to `False`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
