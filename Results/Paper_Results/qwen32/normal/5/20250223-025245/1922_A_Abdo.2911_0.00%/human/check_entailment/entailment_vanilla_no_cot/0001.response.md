To determine the correctness of the program, let's break down the logic and compare it to the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Template Construction**:
   - If the i-th character of strings `a` and `b` are the same, the i-th character of the template should be the lowercase version of that character.
   - If the i-th character of strings `a` and `b` are different, the i-th character of the template should be the uppercase version of the character from `a` (or `b` as they are different).

2. **Matching Conditions**:
   - For strings `a` and `b` to match the template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` must be the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - For string `c` to not match the template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, the corresponding character in `c` must be the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, the corresponding character in `c` must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.

### Program Logic:
1. **Template Construction**:
   - The program constructs the template correctly by iterating over each character of `a` and `b` and applying the rules described above.

2. **Matching Conditions**:
   - The program then checks if `a` and `b` match the template.
     - For each character in the template, it checks whether the conditions for matching are met.
   - The program also checks if `c` does not match the template.
     - For each character in the template, it checks whether the conditions for not matching are met.
   - If `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Verification:
- The program correctly constructs the template based on the given rules.
- The program accurately checks whether `a` and `b` match the template.
- The program correctly verifies whether `c` does not match the template.
- The program handles each test case independently and prints the correct output for each.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
