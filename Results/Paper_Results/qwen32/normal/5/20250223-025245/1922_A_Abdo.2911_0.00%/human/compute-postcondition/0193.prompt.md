Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise `match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True; `_` is the current value of `_` plus 1, and `_` must be less than `t`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the stripped input string; `b` is the stripped input string; `c` is the stripped input string; `template` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise `match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True; `_` is the current value of `_` plus 1 and `_` is less than `t`; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `a` is the stripped input string; `b` is the stripped input string; `c` is the stripped input string; `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise `match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True; `_` is the current value of `_` plus 1 and `_` is less than `t`; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `a` is the stripped input string; `b` is the stripped input string; `c` is the stripped input string; `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]`, and now it includes `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]` at the end; `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `match_a_b` is True if no mismatches were found according to the loop conditions, otherwise `match_a_b` is False; `match_c` is True; `_` is the current value of `_` plus 1 and `_` is less than `t`; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `a` is the stripped input string; `b` is the stripped input string; `c` is the stripped input string; `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]`; `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
