Output State: **`match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all `n` iterations without setting `match_a_b` to `False`; `match_c` is `False`; `_` is `current_value_of_ + n` and is less than `t`; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same; `template` remains the same; `i` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains 4, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
