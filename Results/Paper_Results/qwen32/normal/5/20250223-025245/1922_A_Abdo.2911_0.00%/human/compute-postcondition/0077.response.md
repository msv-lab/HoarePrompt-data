The code snippet provided only assigns the value `False` to the variable `match_c`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the initial state of all other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`, `match_a_b` retains its initial value, `i` is 2, `match_c` is False**.
