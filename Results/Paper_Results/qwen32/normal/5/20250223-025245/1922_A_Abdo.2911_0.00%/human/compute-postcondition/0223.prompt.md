Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` is True; `match_c` is True; `_` is the current value of `_` plus `n` and `_` is less than `t`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the stripped input string; `b` is the stripped input string; `c` is the stripped input string; `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is lowercase. If `template[i]` is not lowercase, `match_a_b` is False if either `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True. `match_c` is True throughout. `_` is the current value of `_` plus `n` and `_` is less than `t`. `n` is greater than 0. `a`, `b`, and `c` are stripped input strings. `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`match_a_b` is False if `template[i]` is lowercase and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is not lowercase, `match_a_b` is False if either `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True. `match_c` is True. `_` is the current value of `_` plus `n` and `_` is less than `t`. `n` is greater than 0. `a`, `b`, and `c` are stripped input strings. `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`. `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `i`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is lowercase, or if `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` when `template[i]` is not lowercase, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4. If `template[i]` is lowercase, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains unchanged. If `template[i]` is not lowercase, `match_a_b` is False if `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
