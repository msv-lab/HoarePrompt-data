Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all `n` iterations without setting `match_a_b` to `False`. `match_c` is `False` if `c[i]` does not match `template[i]` according to the given conditions. `_` is `current_value_of_ + n` and is less than `t`. `n` is greater than 0. `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same. `template` remains the same. `i` is 5. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i] != template[i]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `template[i]` is not lowercase and `c[i].lower() != template[i].lower()`, `match_c` is set to `False`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
