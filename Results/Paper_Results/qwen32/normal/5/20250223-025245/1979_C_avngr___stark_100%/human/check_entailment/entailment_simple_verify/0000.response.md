Let's carefully analyze the given problem, the provided code, the annotations, and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct or incorrect.

### Problem Recap
The task is to distribute a set of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. Mathematically, for each \(i\), the following must hold:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]

### Provided Code Analysis
The code calculates the LCM of the multipliers \(k_i\) and then distributes the bets based on this LCM.

#### Function Breakdown
- **func_1(a, b)**: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
- **func_2(numbers)**: Computes the LCM of a list of integers.

#### Main Logic
1. Read the number of test cases \(t\).
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of outcomes \(n\).
   - Read the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
   - Compute the LCM \(m\) of the multipliers.
   - Compute the bets \(x_i\) as \(m // k_i\).
   - Check if the total bet \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\) is less than \(m\).
   - If the total bet is less than \(m\), print the bets; otherwise, print \(-1\).

### Annotations and Code Behavior
- The annotations correctly state that `func_1` calculates the LCM of two integers.
- `func_2` calculates the LCM of the list of multipliers.
- The bets are calculated as \(x_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\).
- The total bet is checked against \(m\).

### Verification
Let's verify if the logic is correct by checking the conditions:
1. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the multipliers ensures that each \(x_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\) is an integer.
2. **Bet Calculation**: Each bet \(x_i\) is distributed in such a way that the total bet \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\) is minimized.
3. **Condition Check**: The total bet \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\) is compared against \(m\). If the total bet is less than \(m\), then for each \(i\):
   \[ k_i \cdot x_i = k_i \cdot \frac{m}{k_i} = m \]
   Since \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < m\), the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i\) is satisfied for all \(i\).

### Conclusion
The provided code correctly calculates the LCM and uses it to distribute the bets in a way that satisfies the problem's condition. The original assessment incorrectly states that the code does not solve the problem, as the logic and implementation are correct.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
