### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that, if any one of the outcomes wins, the total winnings (multiplied by the respective multiplier) are strictly greater than the total amount bet. 

#### Solution Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k` are read.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM of two numbers is calculated using the formula: `LCM(a, b) = abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function computes the LCM of a list of numbers. It does this by iteratively applying `func_1` to the current result and the next number in the list.
   - The final result is the LCM of all the numbers in the list.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers `k` is calculated using `func_2`.
   - For each outcome `i`, the bet `c[i]` is set to `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM.
   - The program checks if the total sum of all bets `sum(c)` is less than `m`. If not, it prints `-1`.
   - If the sum of bets is less than `m`, it prints the bets `c`.

#### Verification:
- **LCM Calculation:** The LCM of a set of numbers ensures that each number divides the LCM. This means that for each outcome `i`, `m // k[i]` will be an integer, and the total bet `sum(c)` will be less than `m` if a solution exists.
- **Condition Check:** The condition `sum(c) < m` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the winnings for any winning outcome.
- **Output:** If a valid distribution of bets exists, it is printed; otherwise, `-1` is printed.

#### Testing:
- The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the program. For instance, in the first test case, the LCM of `[3, 2, 7]` is `42`, and the bets `[27, 41, 12]` satisfy the condition `sum([27, 41, 12]) < 42` and `k_i * c[i] > sum(c)` for all `i`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid distribution of bets exists and outputs the bets if they exist. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
