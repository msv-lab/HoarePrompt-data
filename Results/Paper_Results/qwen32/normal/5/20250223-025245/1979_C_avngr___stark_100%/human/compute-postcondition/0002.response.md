To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code snippet on the variables `numbers` and `result`. The code snippet involves calling a function `func_1` with `result` and `num` as arguments, and then assigning the output of this function back to `result`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state or provided in the code snippet, we can only infer that `result` will be updated to whatever `func_1(result, num)` returns. The variable `numbers` remains unchanged unless `func_1` modifies it, which is not indicated in the provided code.

Given the initial state:
- `numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
- `result` is the first element of the `numbers` list.

After the code execution:
- `result` will be updated to the return value of `func_1(result, num)`.
- `numbers` remains unchanged unless `func_1` modifies it, which is not the case here.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `result` is the return value of `func_1(result, num)`**.
