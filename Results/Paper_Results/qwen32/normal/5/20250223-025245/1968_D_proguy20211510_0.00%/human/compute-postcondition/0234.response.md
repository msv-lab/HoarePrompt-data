Output State: **`pres` is a list with an additional element `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is a string with the additional character `s[i]` twice, `s` is a string, `i` is `i + 2`, `preb` is a list with two additional elements `sb + b[i]`, `sb` is a string with the additional character `b[i]` twice.**

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` adds the character `s[i]` to the string `ss`. Since `ss` already had `s[i]` added to it in the initial state, after this operation, `ss` will have `s[i]` added again, making it `ss` with `s[i]` twice. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.
