The code snippet `sb += b[i]` appends the character `b[i]` to the string `sb`. Given the initial state, this operation directly modifies `sb` by adding `b[i]` to it again, making `sb` now include `b[i]` twice in a row. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pres` is a list with an additional element `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is a string with the additional character `s[i]`, `s` is a string, `i` is `i + 2`, `preb` is a list with two additional elements `sb + b[i]`, `sb` is a string with the additional character `b[i]` twice.**
