The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the length of the list `pres`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `pres`. If `i` is less than the length of `pres`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `pres` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 1 element, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the single element `preb[0] + rem * b[0]`, `ptss` is a list containing the single element `pres[0] + rem * s[0]`, `i` is 1, `rem` is `k - 1`**
