The code snippet `s.append(maxa)` appends the value of `maxa` to the list `s`. This means that the list `s` will now have one additional element, which is `maxa`.

Given the initial state, `s` was a list that contained either `a[ps - 1]` or `[(k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]` depending on the values of `foundb` and `founds`. After appending `maxa`, the list `s` will have `maxa` as its last element.

The other variables remain unchanged. The `pres` list, which is a list of cumulative sums of `s`, will also be affected because a new element has been added to `s`. However, since the code snippet does not update `pres`, we assume that it is not recalculated in this snippet. Therefore, `pres` will not reflect the new cumulative sum including the newly appended `maxa`.

Output State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` with at least `len(pres)` elements, `sb` is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` if `foundb` and `founds` are True, otherwise `sb` is 0, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s` plus `maxa` if `founds` is True, otherwise `ss` is `a[ps - 1]`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]`, `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]` if `founds` is True, otherwise `ptss` is a list containing `k * a[ps - 1]`, `i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `maxb` is undefined, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list containing `[(k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]` if `foundb` and `founds` are True, otherwise `b` contains `a[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa` and `foundb` is True, or `b` contains `a[pb - 1]` and `foundb` is False, and `s` is a list containing `[(k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` and `founds` are True, otherwise `s` is a list containing `a[ps - 1], maxa`. If `foundb` is True, `b` includes an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, then `b` contains an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.**
