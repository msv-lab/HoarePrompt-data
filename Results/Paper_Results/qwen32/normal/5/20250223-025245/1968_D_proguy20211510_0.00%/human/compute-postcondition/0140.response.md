Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `k` are integers.
- `pb` and `ps` are integers.
- `p` is a list of integers.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`.
- `founds` and `foundb` are provided (though their exact values are not specified).
- `b` and `s` are lists of length `k`.
- `i` is set to `k`.
- `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index.
- `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index.
- `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`.
- `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`.
- `ptsb` is a list containing values calculated based on `preb` and `b`.
- `ptss` is a list containing values calculated based on `pres` and `s`.
- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('Draw')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement `print('Draw')` directly outputs the string `'Draw'`. There are no variables or conditions in the print statement that would change the output based on the initial state provided. The string `'Draw'` is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or their values.

### Final Output:
Output: **Draw**
