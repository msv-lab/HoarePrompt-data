The given print statement is `print('Bodya')`. This statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables or objects in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Bodya'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The print statement is `print('Bodya')`.
2. The string `'Bodya'` is explicitly provided and does not depend on any variable or computation.
3. Therefore, the output of this print statement will be the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
