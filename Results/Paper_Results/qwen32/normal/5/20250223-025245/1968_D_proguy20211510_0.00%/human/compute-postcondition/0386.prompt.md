Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; p is a list of n integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n for all 1 <= i <= n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `YES` is 'YES'; `NO` is 'NO'; `MOD` is 1000000007; `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    maxa = max(a)
    if a[pb - 1] == a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Draw')
        continue
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        print('Bodya')
        continue
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Sasha')
        continue
    b, s = [], []
    founds, foundb = False, False
    for i in range(k):
        if foundb and founds:
            b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            break
        if foundb:
            b.append(maxa)
        elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
            foundb = True
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
        else:
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
            pb = p[pb - 1]
        if founds:
            s.append(maxa)
        elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
            founds = True
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
        else:
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
            ps = p[ps - 1]
    preb, pres = [], []
    sb, ss = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        preb.append(sb + b[i])
        sb += b[i]
        pres.append(ss + s[i])
        ss += s[i]
    ptsb, ptss = [], []
    for i in range(len(pres)):
        rem = k - (i + 1)
        ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
        ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])
    maxs, maxb = max(ptss), max(ptsb)
    if maxs > maxb:
        print('Sasha')
    elif maxs < maxb:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[k - 1] + 0 * b[k - 1]]`; `ptss` is a list containing `[pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1], ..., pres[k - 1] + 0 * s[k - 1]]`; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, the current value of `maxs` is greater than the current value of `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` with at least `len(pres)` elements, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]`, `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs > maxb` holds. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `preb` is a list containing the elements `[sb + b[0], sb + b[0] + b[1], ..., sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1]]`; `pres` is a list containing the elements `[ss + s[0], ss + s[0] + s[1], ..., ss + s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[len(s) - 1]]`; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * b[len(s) - 1]]`; `ptss` is a list containing the elements `[pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1], ..., pres[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * s[len(s) - 1]]`; `i` is `len(s) - 1`; `rem` is `k - len(s)`; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `b` contains up to `k` elements where `maxa` is appended based on conditions; `s` contains at least one element; and `founds` is True if `maxa` was found in `s`. Additionally, if `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is greater than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is either less than `maxb` or equal to `maxb`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
