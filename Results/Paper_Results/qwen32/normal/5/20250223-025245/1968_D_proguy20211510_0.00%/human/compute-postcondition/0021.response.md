Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers obtained by converting the previously split input strings to integers; `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the newly split input strings to integers; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the newly split input strings to integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. It is not the case that both `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are equal to `maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, then `a[pb - 1]` remains equal to `maxa` and `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. Otherwise, `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, and `a[ps - 1]` remains unchanged, whether or not it is equal to `maxa`.**
