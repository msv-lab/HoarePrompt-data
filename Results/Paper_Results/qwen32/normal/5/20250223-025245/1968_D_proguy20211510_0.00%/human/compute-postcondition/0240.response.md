Output State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 1 element, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the single element `preb[0] + rem * b[0]`, `ptss` is a list containing the single element `pres[0] + rem * s[0]`, `i` is 0, `rem` is `k - 1`**

Explanation: The value of `ptss` is updated to include a new element, which is the result of `pres[0] + rem * s[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
