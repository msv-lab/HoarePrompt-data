Given the initial state, we have several lists and variables defined:

- `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`.
- `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least `len(pres)` elements.
- `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`.
- `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`.
- `ptsb` is a list calculated by adding `(k-1) * b[0]`, `(k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `(k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]` to the corresponding elements of `preb`.
- `ptss` is a list calculated by adding `(k-1) * s[0]`, `(k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `(k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]` to the corresponding elements of `pres`.
- `i` is `len(pres) - 1`.
- `rem` is `k - len(pres)`.
- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.
- `maxs` is greater than or equal to `maxb`.

The `print('Draw')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or lists described above. It simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Draw**
