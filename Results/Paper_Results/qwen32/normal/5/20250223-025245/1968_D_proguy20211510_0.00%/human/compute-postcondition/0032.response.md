Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0. `foundb` is true. If `founds` is also true, then `b` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa` and `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `b` or `s`. `b` now includes an additional element `maxa`.**

In natural language: The list `b` now contains an additional element `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state.
