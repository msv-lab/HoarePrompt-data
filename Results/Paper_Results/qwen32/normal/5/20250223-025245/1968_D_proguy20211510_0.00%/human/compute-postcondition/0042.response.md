Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0. `founds` is true. If `foundb` is true, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. `b` and `s` each include an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. If `foundb` is false, `b` includes the element `a[pb - 1]` at the end, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.**

In simpler terms: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, and `foundb` are as initially defined; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is 0. `founds` is true, meaning `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. If `foundb` is also true, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is false, `b` includes the element `a[pb - 1]` at the end, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.**
