Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `founds` is a boolean; `foundb` is a boolean; `b` is a list of integers with an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended; `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended; `i` is an integer; `preb` is a list of integers; `pres` is a list of integers; `sb` is an integer; `ss` is an integer; `ptsb` is a list of integers; `ptss` is a list of integers; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
