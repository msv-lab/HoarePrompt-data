Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, a list `p` of `n` integers, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided values, which is not detailed here but involves processing the constraints and inputs according to the problem's requirements.**
