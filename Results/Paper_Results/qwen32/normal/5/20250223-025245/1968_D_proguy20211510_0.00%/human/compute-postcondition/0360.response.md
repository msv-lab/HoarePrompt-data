The code snippet `ss += s[i]` modifies the value of `ss` by adding `s[i]` to it. Given that `i` is `k + 1`, `ss` is updated to `ss + s[k + 1]`.

Hereâ€™s the updated state of the variables:
- `preb` remains unchanged as a list containing the elements `sb + b[i]`, `sb + b[i] + b[i]`, and `sb + b[i]`.
- `pres` remains unchanged as a list containing the elements `s[k - 1] + s[k - 1]`, `s[k] + s[k]`, and `ss + s[i]`.
- `sb` remains unchanged as `sb + b[i] + b[i] + b[k + 1]`.
- `ss` is updated to `ss + s[k + 1]`.
- `ptsb` remains unchanged as a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]`.
- `ptss` remains unchanged as a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]`.
- `i` remains `k + 1`.
- `rem` remains `0`.
- `maxs` remains the maximum value in `ptss`.
- `maxb` remains the maximum value in `ptsb`.
- `n` remains an integer.
- `k` remains an integer.
- `pb` remains an integer.
- `ps` remains an integer.
- `p` remains a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `a` remains a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `maxa` remains the maximum value in `a`.
- `b` remains containing up to `k` elements where `maxa` is appended based on conditions.
- `s` remains containing at least one element, and `founds` remains True if `maxa` was found in `s`.
