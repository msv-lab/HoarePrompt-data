Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, there are a few issues:

1. **Handling of Cycles in the Permutation:**
   - The code does not correctly handle cycles in the permutation. If both players enter a cycle and the maximum value in the cycle is not the maximum value in the entire array, the code might not correctly determine the winner. The current implementation only checks if the current position has the maximum value and then assumes the player will stay in the cycle indefinitely, which is not always the case.

2. **Infinite Loops:**
   - The code does not account for the possibility of infinite loops due to cycles in the permutation. The loop runs for `k` iterations, but if `k` is very large and the players enter a cycle, the code might not correctly determine the scores after `k` turns.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases where `k` is very large (up to \(10^9\)). For large `k`, the players might enter a cycle, and the code should efficiently handle this without running into performance issues.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 1000000000 1 2
1 2 3 4
1 1 1 1
```

In this case, both players are in a cycle (since the permutation is the identity permutation), and all values in the array are the same. The correct output should be "Draw" because both players will have the same score after `k` turns. However, the current code might not handle this correctly due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
