Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `founds` is a boolean; `foundb` is a boolean; `b` is a list of integers; `s` is a list of integers with an additional element `a[ps - 1]` appended; `i` is an integer; `preb` is a list of integers; `pres` is a list of integers; `sb` is an integer; `ss` is an integer; `ptsb` is a list of integers; `ptss` is a list of integers; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, then `founds` is True and `s` has an additional element `a[ps - 1]`. Otherwise, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.**
