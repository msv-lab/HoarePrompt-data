The code snippet appends a new value to the list `ptss`. This new value is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. Given that `i` is `k - 1`, and `rem` is `0`, the expression simplifies to `pres[k - 1] + 0 * s[k - 1]`, which is just `pres[k - 1]`.

Since `pres[k - 1]` is already the last element of `ptss`, the new value being appended is the same as the existing last element of `ptss`. Therefore, `ptss` will now have an additional element which is the same as its previous last element.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k - 1`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing `preb[k - 1], preb[k - 1]`; `ptss` is a list containing `pres[k - 1], pres[k - 1]`; `rem` is 0.**
