The code snippet `b.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the element at index `pb - 1` of the list `a` to the list `b`. This will change the list `b` by adding one more element to it, but it does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, or `i`.

Given that `foundb` is True, the initial state suggests that `b` already includes additional elements `maxa` and `(k - 2) * maxa` if `founds` is also True. However, the code snippet only appends `a[pb - 1]` to `b` regardless of the state of `founds`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1. `foundb` is True. If `foundb` and `founds` are true, `b` includes an additional element `maxa` and an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa`, and `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa` and an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `foundb` is true and `founds` is false, `b` includes an additional element `maxa` and now includes `a[pb - 1]` at the end. If `foundb` is false and `founds` is true, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `founds` is false, `b` includes the element `a[pb - 1]` at the end, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`; `s` includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.**
