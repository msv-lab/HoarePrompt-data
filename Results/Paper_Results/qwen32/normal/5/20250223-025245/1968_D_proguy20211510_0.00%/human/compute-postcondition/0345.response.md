Output State: **`preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]`, `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]`, `i` is `k - 1`, `rem` is `0`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` contains up to `k` elements where `maxa` is appended based on conditions, `s` contains up to `k` elements where `maxa` is appended based on conditions, and `founds` is True if `maxa` was found in `s`.**

Explanation: The values of `sb` and `ss` have been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
