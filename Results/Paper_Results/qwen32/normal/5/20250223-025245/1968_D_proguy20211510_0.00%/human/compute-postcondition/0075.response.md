The `break` statement will terminate the innermost loop or if statement it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb`, `i`, or `s` will be changed by the `break` statement. The only change is that the loop or if statement will be exited.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `s` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
