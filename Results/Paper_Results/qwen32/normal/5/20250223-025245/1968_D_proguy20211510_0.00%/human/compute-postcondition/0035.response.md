The code snippet sets `foundb` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0. `foundb` is true. If `founds` is true, then `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. Additionally, `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`.**
