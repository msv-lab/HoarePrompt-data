The code snippet provided is `rem = k - (i + 1)`. This line recalculates the value of `rem` based on the current values of `k` and `i`.

Initial State: 
- `preb` is a list containing the elements `[sb + b[0], sb + b[0] + b[1], ..., sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1]]`
- `pres` is a list containing at least one element
- `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`
- `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`
- `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * b[len(s) - 1]` and `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`
- `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * s[len(s) - 1]` and `pres[len(s) - 1] + (k - (len(s) + 1)) * s[len(s) - 1]`
- `i` is `len(s) + 1`
- `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`
- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer
- `pb` is an integer
- `ps` is an integer
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`
- `b` contains up to `k` elements where `maxa` is appended based on conditions
- `s` contains at least one element
- `founds` is True if `maxa` was found in `s`

After executing the line `rem = k - (i + 1)`, the value of `rem` is recalculated. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`preb` is a list containing the elements `[sb + b[0], sb + b[0] + b[1], ..., sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1]]`; `pres` is a list containing at least one element; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * b[len(s) - 1]` and `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`; `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * s[len(s) - 1]` and `pres[len(s) - 1] + (k - (len(s) + 1)) * s[len(s) - 1]`; `i` is `len(s) + 1`; `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `b` contains up to `k` elements where `maxa` is appended based on conditions; `s` contains at least one element; `founds` is True if `maxa` was found in `s`.**
