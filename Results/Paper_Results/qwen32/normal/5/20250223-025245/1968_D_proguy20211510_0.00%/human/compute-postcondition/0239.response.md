The code snippet appends the value `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` to the list `ptsb`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so the value being appended is `preb[0] + rem * b[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 1 element, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the single element `preb[0] + rem * b[0]`, `ptss` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `rem` is `k - 1`**.
