Output State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 1 element, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the single element `preb[0] + rem * b[0]`, `ptss` is a list containing the single element `pres[0] + rem * s[0]`, `i` is 1, `rem` is `k - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `rem` is recalculated to be `k - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 2` given that `i` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
