To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(len_unique):`. This means we need to ensure that `len_unique` is set appropriately so that the loop can execute.

### Analysis:
1. **`i`**: This is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.
2. **`len_unique`**: This is the length of the `unique_chars` list. For the loop to execute at least once, `len_unique` must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments:
- **`len_unique`**: Must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes.
- **`unique_chars`**: Since `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `encoded` that must have at least 1 character; `char_map` is an empty dictionary; `len_unique` is greater than 0**.
