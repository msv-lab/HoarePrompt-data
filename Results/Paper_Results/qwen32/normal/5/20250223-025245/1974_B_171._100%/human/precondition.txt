encoded is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and represents the encoded result of the original string s. The length of each string b is a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and the total sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
