You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: `encoded` is a list of strings, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `encoded`; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its reverse counterpart in `unique_chars` (i.e., the first character is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on); `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string `decoded` where each character in the list `encoded` has been replaced by its mapped value from the dictionary `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a list of strings where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters and has a length between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a string `decoded` where each character in the list `encoded` has been replaced by its mapped value from the dictionary `char_map`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string `decoded` where each character in the list `encoded` has been replaced by its mapped value from the dictionary `char_map`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
