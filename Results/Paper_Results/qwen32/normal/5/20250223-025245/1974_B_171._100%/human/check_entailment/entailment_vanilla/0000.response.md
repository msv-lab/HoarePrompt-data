### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element of this list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - For each test case, the program calls the function `func_1(encoded)` to decode the string `b`.
   - Inside `func_1`, it first creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them to form the string `r`.
   - It then creates a mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character is mapped to the last, the second to the second from the end, etc.).
   - Finally, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the decoded strings.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of the Decoding Logic**:
  - The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them to form `r`.
  - It then creates a symmetric mapping of characters in `r`.
  - Each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric character as per the mapping, which should correctly decode the string back to the original.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles single-character strings and strings with all identical characters correctly.
  - The program also handles strings with all unique characters correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
