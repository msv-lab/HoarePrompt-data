Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `encoded`; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its reverse counterpart in `unique_chars` (i.e., the first character is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on); `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `char_map` will contain a mapping of each unique character in `unique_chars` to its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars`. For example, if `unique_chars` is `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`, then `char_map` will be `{'a': 'd', 'b': 'c', 'c': 'b', 'd': 'a'}`. The other variables like `encoded` and `len_unique` remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and values.
