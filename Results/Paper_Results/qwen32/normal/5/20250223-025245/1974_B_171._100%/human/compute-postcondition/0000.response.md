The code snippet creates a set from the list of strings `encoded`, which removes any duplicate characters. It then sorts this set of unique characters and assigns the result to the variable `unique_chars`.

Given the initial state, `encoded` is a list of strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

After the code execution:
- `unique_chars` will be a sorted list of unique characters found in all the strings within `encoded`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `encoded`.**
