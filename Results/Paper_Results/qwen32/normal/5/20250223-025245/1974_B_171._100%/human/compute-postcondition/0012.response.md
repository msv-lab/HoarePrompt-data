Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a list of strings where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters and has a length between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a string `decoded` where each character in the list `encoded` has been replaced by its mapped value from the dictionary `char_map`.**
