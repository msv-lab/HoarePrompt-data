You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: `encoded` is a list of strings, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `encoded`; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its reverse counterpart in `unique_chars` (i.e., the first character is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on); `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string `decoded` where each character in the list `encoded` has been replaced by its mapped value from the dictionary `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of strings `encoded`, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters, and returns a single string `decoded`. Each character in the input strings is replaced by its corresponding character from a mapping where each unique character in the input is mapped to its reverse counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the test cases, extracting the number of test cases `t` first.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   
2. **Decoding Process:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the encoded string `b`.
   - It first creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
   - It then constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
   - Finally, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character in `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings for all test cases are stored in the list `results`.
   - These results are printed one by one.

### Checking the Logic:

- **Uniqueness and Sorting:**
  - The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them, which aligns with the problem's requirement to form the string `r`.

- **Symmetric Mapping:**
  - The mapping of characters to their symmetric counterparts in `r` is correctly implemented. Each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric counterpart, as required.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program handles multiple test cases by iterating through each one, reading the necessary inputs, and storing the results.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. It accurately constructs the string `r`, maps characters symmetrically, and handles multiple test cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
