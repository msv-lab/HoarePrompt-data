The code snippet initializes an empty dictionary named `char_map`. This does not affect the values of `encoded` or `unique_chars`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**
