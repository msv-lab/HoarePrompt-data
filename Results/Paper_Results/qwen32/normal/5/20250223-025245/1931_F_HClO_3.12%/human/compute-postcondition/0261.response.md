To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the loop's behavior and the given information.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(m - 2):
    input()
```
This loop will execute `m - 2` times. After each iteration, it consumes an input, but it does not alter any of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, or `val` within its body. The only thing that changes is the number of times the loop has executed, which is tracked by the loop variable `_` and the fact that `m - 2` inputs are consumed.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that after all `m - 2` iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` remain unchanged. The only change is in the number of times the loop has executed, which is `m - 2`.

Therefore, after all the executions of the loop have finished, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`)**

In simpler terms, all the variables remain the same as they were after the initial setup, except that `m - 2` inputs have been consumed by the loop.
