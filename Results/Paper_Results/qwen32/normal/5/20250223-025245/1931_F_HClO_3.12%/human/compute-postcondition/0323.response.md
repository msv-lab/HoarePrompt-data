The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value `a1` at the index `idx2` in the list `l1`. This means that the length of `l1` will increase by 1, and all elements after `idx2` will be shifted one position to the right.

Given the initial state, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, and `a1` is the first integer from the latest input. After the insertion, `l1` will have `a1` at position `idx2`.

The other variables remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2` (this list will need to be recalculated to reflect the new `l1`), `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is -1, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, and `val` is an empty list.**
