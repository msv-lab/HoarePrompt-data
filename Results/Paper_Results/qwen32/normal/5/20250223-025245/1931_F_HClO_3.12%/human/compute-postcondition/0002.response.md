The code snippet assigns the values of `n` and `m` based on the input provided. The input is expected to be two integers separated by a space. After the execution of the code, `n` and `m` will hold these integer values, and `t` remains unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input**.
