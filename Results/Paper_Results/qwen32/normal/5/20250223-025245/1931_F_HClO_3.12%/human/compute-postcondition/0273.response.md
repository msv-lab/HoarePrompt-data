The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, the values of `idx1` and `idx2` will be updated to `n - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`). The current elements at index `i + p1` in `l1` and `i + p2` in `l2` are `a2` and `a1` respectively.**
