The code snippet `val.append((a3, l3))` adds a tuple containing `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer from the latest input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, and if `m` is 2, the condition `m == 2` is true. Additionally, if `a1` appears before `a2` in `l3`, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, `l2` is a list containing elements from the latest input excluding all occurrences of `a1` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`.**
