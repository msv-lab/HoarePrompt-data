The code snippet `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` at the position `idx1` in the list `l2`. This means that `l2` will now have `a2` inserted at the specified index, shifting any elements that were originally at or after `idx1` one position to the right.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is 2 or any value other than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is -1, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.**

In simpler terms, `l2` now includes `a2` at the position `idx1`, shifting other elements as necessary. All other variables remain unchanged.
