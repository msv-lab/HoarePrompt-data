Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of `n` distinct integers across `k` lines. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to arrange the lists such that, after inserting the author of each screenshot into the appropriate position, all lists (except for the author) are identical. It prints 'yes' if such an arrangement is possible for all test cases, otherwise 'no'.**
