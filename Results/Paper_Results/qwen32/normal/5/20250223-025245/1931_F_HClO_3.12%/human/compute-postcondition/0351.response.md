To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and the conditions under which it executes.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))
```
This means the loop will execute `m - 2` times. In each iteration, the loop reads an integer `a3` and the rest of the integers `l3` from the input, and appends the tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`.

Given the initial conditions and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After 1 iteration, `val` contains one tuple `(a3, l3)`.
- After 2 iterations, `val` contains two tuples `((a3, l3), (a3, l3))`.
- After 3 iterations, `val` contains three tuples `((a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3))`.

Following this pattern, after `m - 2` iterations, `val` will contain `m - 2` tuples, each of the form `(a3, l3)`.

Therefore, the final output state after all the iterations of the loop will be:
- `val` will contain `m - 2` tuples, each of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first integer from each new input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each new input.

Output State: **`val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each of the form `(a3, l3)`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the list `val` will have `m - 2` entries, where each entry is a tuple consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, as read from the input in each iteration of the loop.
