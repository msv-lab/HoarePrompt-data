The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `m`. The loop will execute `m - 2` times. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `m - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1, which means `m` must be at least 3.

Given the current state, `m` can be 1 or any integer read from the input. To ensure the loop executes, `m` must be adjusted to be at least 3. The values of `t`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` do not affect whether the loop executes, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`**
