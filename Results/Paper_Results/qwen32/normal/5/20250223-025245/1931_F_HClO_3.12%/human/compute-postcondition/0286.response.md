Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`). If the current elements at index `i + p1` in `l1` and `i + p2` in `l2` are `a2` and `a1` respectively, `idx1` and `idx2` are both `n - 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` are both `n - 2` if the current elements at index `i + p1` in `l1` and `i + p2` in `l2` are equal to `a2` and not equal to `a2` respectively, `p1` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, otherwise `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1 if `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both `n - 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
