The only objects in the loop head are the variables `a3` and `l3`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `a3` and `l3` from the `val` list of tuples. If there are more tuples in `val`, the loop will execute again with the next tuple.

At the end of the last iteration, `a3` and `l3` are the values of the first tuple in `val`. For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must contain at least one more tuple. The next tuple will be unpacked into `a3` and `l3`.

State: **`val` contains at least two tuples, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` are the values of the second tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
