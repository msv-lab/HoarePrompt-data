To determine the final output state after the loop executes all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the conditions and the given states after the first three iterations. 

The loop iterates over a list of tuples `val`, where each tuple contains an integer `a3` and a list `l3`. For each tuple, it checks if `l3` is equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed. If any `l3` does not match the expected list, the loop breaks and prints 'no'. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it prints 'yes'.

Given that the loop has executed three times already and hasn't broken, it means that for the first three tuples in `val`, the condition `l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]` has been satisfied. The loop will continue to execute until it either breaks due to a mismatch or completes all iterations.

If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it means that for every tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, `l3` is equal to `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed. In this case, the loop will print 'yes'.

Let's summarize the final state:

- The loop has iterated over all tuples in `val`.
- For each tuple `(a3, l3)`, the condition `l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]` was satisfied.
- The loop did not break and has completed all iterations.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **the loop has completed all iterations without breaking and prints 'yes'.**

In natural language: The loop has finished all its iterations without finding any mismatches between `l3` and the modified list `l` (with `a3` removed). As a result, the final output is 'yes'.
