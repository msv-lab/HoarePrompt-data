Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is 2 or any value other than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input. `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2` (this may change if `a1` was equal to `a2` and was inserted at `idx2`), `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is -1, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.**
