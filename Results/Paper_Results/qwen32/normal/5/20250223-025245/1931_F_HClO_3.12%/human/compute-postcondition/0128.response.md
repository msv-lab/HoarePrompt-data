The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or the loop state in any way that changes their values. Therefore, the variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the fact that the loop has completed all iterations without breaking and prints 'yes' also remains unchanged.

Output State: **the loop has completed all iterations without breaking and prints 'yes', `t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
