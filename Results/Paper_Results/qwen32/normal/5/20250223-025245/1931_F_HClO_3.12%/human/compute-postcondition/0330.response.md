The code snippet `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the remaining integers to `l3`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `val` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is 2 or any value other than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is -1, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.**
