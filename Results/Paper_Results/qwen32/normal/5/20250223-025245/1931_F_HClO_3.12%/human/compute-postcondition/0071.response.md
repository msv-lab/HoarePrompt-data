Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `n` must be at least 2; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is assigned the value of `i` and `p1` is 1; otherwise, `idx2` is assigned the value of `i` and `p2` is 1; if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; if `idx1` >= 0 and `idx2` >= 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
