Correctness: **False**

The provided program incorrectly constructs the mapping from the encoded string `b` to the original string `s`. Specifically, the program maps each unique character in `b` to a character in reverse alphabetical order, which is not the correct approach for decoding.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. The program creates a mapping from each character in the sorted set of `b` to a character in reverse alphabetical order starting from 'a'. This does not align with the encoding process described in the problem statement.

2. The correct approach is to construct the string `r` as the sorted set of unique characters in `b`, and then map each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`.

Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Create the string r as the sorted set of unique characters in b
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(b)))
    # Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric character
    char_map = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    # Decode the string b using the mapping
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

This corrected function will properly decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`.
