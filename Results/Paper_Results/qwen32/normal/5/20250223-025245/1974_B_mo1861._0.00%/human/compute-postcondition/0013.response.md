The code snippet `s += char_map[c]` appends the value of `char_map[c]` to the string `s`. Given that `char_map` is a dictionary mapping each unique character in `b` to a unique character starting from 'a' in reverse order based on the position of the character in the sorted set of `b`, and `c` is the next character in `b` after the current `c`, the value `char_map[c]` is a specific character.

Let's break down the output state:
- The string `s` now includes the character `char_map[c]` appended to it.
- The variables `b`, `char_map`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The character `char_map[c]` is determined by the dictionary mapping and the character `c`.

Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `s` is a string containing the character `char_map[c]` and the newly appended `char_map[c]`, `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` is mapped to a unique character starting from 'a' and incrementing in reverse order based on the position of the character in the sorted set of `b`, `c` is the next character in `b` after the current `c`.**
