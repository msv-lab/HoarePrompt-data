The provided code snippet is a function definition for `func_1` that takes a string `b` as input and is supposed to return the decoded string `s`. However, the actual implementation of the function is not provided in the snippet. Therefore, based on the given information, we can only describe the state after the function is called with the string `b`, assuming the function performs some decoding operation and returns the decoded string.

Given that the function is called multiple times with different strings `b`, and the task is to determine the output state after each call, we can infer that the output state will include the decoded string `s` for each call.

Since the actual decoding logic is not provided, we can only state that the function returns a decoded string `s` for each input string `b`.

Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`**.
