Let's analyze the provided program and function summary in the context of the problem description to determine the correctness of the original assessment.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to decode a string `b` that was encoded by replacing each character in the original string `s` with its symmetric character from a string `r`. The string `r` consists of all distinct letters of `s` in alphabetical order, and each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.

### Provided Program and Function Summary
The provided program attempts to decode the string `b` by creating a mapping from each unique character in `b` to a character in reverse order starting from 'a'. However, this does not align with the problem description which requires mapping each character in `b` to its symmetric character from the sorted set of unique characters in `b`.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary describes the current implementation as mapping each unique character in `b` to a unique character starting from 'a' in reverse order based on the sorted set of characters in `b`. This is incorrect because the mapping should be based on the symmetric characters of the sorted set of unique characters in `b`.

### Original Assessment Analysis
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly decode the string `b` as per the problem description. The issue is that the program maps each character in the sorted set of `b` to a character in reverse order starting from 'a', which is not the intended symmetric mapping required by the problem.

### Correct Implementation
The corrected implementation should map each character in the sorted set of `b` to its symmetric character from the sorted set of unique characters in `b`. This can be achieved by creating a mapping where each character in the sorted set `r` is mapped to its symmetric character `r[-i-1]`.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function as suggested in the original assessment:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Create a sorted set of unique characters from b
    r = sorted(set(b))
    # Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric character
    char_map = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    # Decode the string b using the mapping
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly decode the string `b` according to the problem description. The program incorrectly maps characters, leading to incorrect decoding.

Final: **False**
