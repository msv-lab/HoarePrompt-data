The provided Python code snippet initializes an empty dictionary named `char_map`. This operation does not affect the values of `b` or `s`. The variable `b` remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `s` retains its value, which is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`.

Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**
