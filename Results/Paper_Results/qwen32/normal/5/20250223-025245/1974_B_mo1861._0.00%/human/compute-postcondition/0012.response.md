The only object in the loop head is the variable `c`, which iterates over the string `b`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `c` for the next iteration of the loop. 

Given that `b` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, at the end of the previous iteration, `c` would have taken on the value of the last character processed in `b`. To execute one more time, `c` should take on the value of the next character in `b` if there are any characters left.

Let's assume `b` is a string of length `len(b)`, and `c` has just taken the value of the character at position `i` (0-indexed) in the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` should take the value of the character at position `i + 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` or the length of `b`, we can only express the state in a general form. We know that `c` should be the next character in `b` after the current `c`.

State: **`b` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `s` is a string containing the character `char_map[c]`, `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` is mapped to a unique character starting from 'a' and incrementing in reverse order based on the position of the character in the sorted set of `b`, `c` is the next character in `b` after the current `c`**
