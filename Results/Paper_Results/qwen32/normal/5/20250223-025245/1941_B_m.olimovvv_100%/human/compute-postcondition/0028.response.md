The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts those components to integers, and stores them in the list `b`. This means that the initial state of `b` being defined as having the first `a - 2` elements as 0 is overwritten by the new input values.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input; the output is 'YES' if `b[-2]` and `b[-1]` are both 0; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.**

In simple terms, `b` now holds the list of integers from the input, and the conditions for the output ('YES' or 'NO') are based on the last two elements of the newly formed list `b`.
