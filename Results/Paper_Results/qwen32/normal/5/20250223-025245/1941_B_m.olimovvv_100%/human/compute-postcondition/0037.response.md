The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables for the next iteration of the loop. According to the loop statement, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `a - 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The value of `a` remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`, `b[2]` is `b[2] - b[0]`**
