The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a - 2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `a` must be at least 4 (so `a - 2` is at least 2, and `i` being 2 is less than `a - 2`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`a` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is 0, `b[2]` is `b[2] - 2 * b[1]`, `b[3]` is `b[3] - b[1]`**
