The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes several variables and their values or conditions, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is at least 2.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `b[0]` is 0.
   - `b[1]` is recalculated as `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`.
   - `b[2]` is recalculated as `b[2] - b[0]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement directly prints the string `'NO'`.
   - The values of `a`, `i`, and the elements of the list `b` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement is the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
