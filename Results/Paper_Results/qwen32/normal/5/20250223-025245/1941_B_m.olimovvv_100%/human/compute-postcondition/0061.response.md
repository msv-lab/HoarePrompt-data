The code snippet `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` means that the value of `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of `b[i]`. The initial state tells us that `a` is greater than 2, `b[i]` is unchanged, and `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`. The only change introduced by the code snippet is to `b[i + 2]`.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 2; `b[i]` is unchanged; `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`; `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `b[i]`.**
