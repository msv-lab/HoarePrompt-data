The initial state provides conditions about the variables `a` and `b[i]`, but these conditions do not affect the print statement directly. The print statement simply outputs the string 'NO', regardless of the values of `a` or `b[i]`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `a` is greater than 2 and `b[i]` is less than 0.
2. The print statement `print('NO')` does not depend on the values of `a` or `b[i]`. It will always output the string 'NO'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **NO**
