The code snippet `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. The values of `a` and `i` are not directly affected by this operation, except for the condition `i` is `i + 1`, which seems to imply `i` has already been incremented before this line in the broader context. The condition `if b[i] < 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement` is not relevant to the current operation and does not affect the output state directly unless `b[i]` becomes negative as a result of this operation, which is not the case here.

Output State: **`a` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`.**
