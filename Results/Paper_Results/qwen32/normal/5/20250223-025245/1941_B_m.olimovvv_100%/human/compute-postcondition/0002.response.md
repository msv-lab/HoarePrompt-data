The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and `a` is an input integer. The value of `t` is not directly affected by the code snippet, and `a` remains an input integer. The new variable `b` is created and assigned the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
