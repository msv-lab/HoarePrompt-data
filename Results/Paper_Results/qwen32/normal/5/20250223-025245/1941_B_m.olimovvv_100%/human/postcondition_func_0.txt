The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it checks if the list can be transformed to all zeros by a specific set of operations: subtracting twice the value of an element from the next element and the value of the element from the element after that, starting from the first element. If the transformation is possible and the last two elements are zero, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.
