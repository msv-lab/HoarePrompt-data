Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1. If `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, `re` is incremented by 1, and if `re` is equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged; `res` now includes `a[i]`. If `l[a[i] - 1] != 1`, `re` and `res` remain unchanged.**
