To determine the output of the `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved in the print statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variables and their Definitions**:
   - `ul` is `k * 2` if `k * 2` is reached before `n` iterations; otherwise, `2 * n`.
   - `ur` is 2 if the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is 2 and `ur` is incremented by 2; otherwise, `ur` remains 0.
   - `re` is the number of unique elements with count 1 found in `a` up to `k` or `n` iterations.
   - `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `res` are unchanged.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

2. **Focus on the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`. This means it will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and will not add a newline after the print (due to `end=' '`).

### Determining the Values:
- **`a[i]`**: The value of `a[i]` depends on the list `a` and the current value of `i`. Since the exact values of `a` and `i` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `a[i]`. However, we know that `a[i]` is an element of the list `a` at index `i`.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, the output will be the value of `a[i]` printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end. Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified, we describe it in terms of the list `a` and the index `i`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a)**
