The code reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 and that `input()` returns `t`. However, the subsequent code does not use `t` and instead assigns values to `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input.**
