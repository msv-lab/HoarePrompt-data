Postcondition: **`ul` is `k * 2` if `k * 2` is reached before `n` iterations; otherwise, `ul` is `2 * n`; `ur` is 0; `re` is 0; `n` is a positive integer; `k` is a non-zero integer and `k` is `2 * k - ul`; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`; `res` is an empty list.**
