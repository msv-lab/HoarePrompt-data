Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `ul` is defined conditionally based on whether `k * 2` is reached before `n` iterations; otherwise, it is `2 * n`.
   - `ur` is defined as `0`.
   - `re` is the count of unique elements with a count of `1` found in `a` up to `k` or `n` iterations.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `l` remains unchanged.
   - `r` remains unchanged.
   - `res` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
   - The element at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is `2`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Determine the Value of `a[i]`:**
   - `i` is set to `n`, so `a[i]` is `a[n]`.

2. **Value of the Element at Index `a[i] - 1` in `r`:**
   - The problem states that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is `2`. This means `r[a[n] - 1] = 2`.

3. **What is Printed:**
   - The print statement prints `a[i]` twice. Since `i` is `n`, it prints `a[n]` twice.
   - The `end=' '` argument ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `a[n]` twice, separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[n] a[n]** (where `a[n]` is the element at index `n` in the list `a`)
