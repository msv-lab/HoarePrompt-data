Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `r` is a list.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is an index within the bounds of `a`.
- The value at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement is printing the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and the `end=' '` ensures that there is no newline after the print statement (the default behavior of `print` is to add a newline at the end).

- `a[i]` refers to the element in the list `a` at the index `i`. 
- The value of `a[i]` is printed twice in the output.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of the variable `a[i]`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a)**
