The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (which we don't know exactly, but we know it was the iteration that just finished), and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The variable `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `k` is the second integer from the input, `re` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` where `i` is the value at the end of the previous iteration. However, in the state description, we can simply say `i` is incremented by 1.
