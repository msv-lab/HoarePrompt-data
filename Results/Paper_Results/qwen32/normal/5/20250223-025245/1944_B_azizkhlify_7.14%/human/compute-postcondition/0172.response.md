To determine the output of the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the relevant parts of the code.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This variable doesn't seem to affect the specific `print` statement in question.
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than or equal to 1.
3. **`a`**: A list of integers read from the input.
4. **`l`**: A list where each index `j` contains the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`.
5. **`r`**: A list of `n` zeros with the value at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`. However, this list `r` is not directly used in the `print` statement.
6. **`ul`**: The sum of 2 for each time `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` occurred up to the point where the loop breaks or all iterations are completed.
7. **`ur`**: Initialized to 0, but not used directly in the `print` statement.
8. **`res`**: Must contain at least one element, but the specific content is not crucial for this `print` statement.
9. **`k`**: A non-zero integer if the if part was executed, but there is no else part mentioned, so this value is not directly relevant.
10. **`re`**: The count of elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes.
11. **`i`**: The last index that was processed, which is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or the index where `re` equals `k`.

### Analysis of the Loop and `i`

The key variable here is `i`, which is the last index processed in the loop. The loop runs from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, and `i` is updated in each iteration. The loop breaks if `re` equals `k`. Given that `re` counts the occurrences where `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, and `k` is a non-zero integer, the loop will terminate when `re` reaches `k`.

If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `i` will be `2 * n - 2`. However, if the loop breaks early when `re` equals `k`, `i` will be the index where `re` reached `k`.

### Conclusion

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the last index `i` that was processed before the loop either completes or breaks. Since the exact values of `a`, `l`, `k`, and `re` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `i`. However, we can describe it based on the given conditions.

Output: **i (where i is the last index processed in the loop, which is either 2*n-2 if the loop completes or the index where re equals k if the loop breaks)**
