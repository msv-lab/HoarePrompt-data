To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the print statement itself.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`r` is a list**: This list is mentioned but not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
2. **`a` is a list of integers**: This is the list from which elements are being accessed and printed.
3. **`i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**: This means that `i` holds the index of the element in the list `a` that we are interested in. The exact value of `i` before the increment is not provided, but after the increment, `i` points to the next element in the list `a`.
4. **`n` is the same as before**: This variable is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```
This statement prints the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.

### Output Explanation:
- **`a[i]`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `a[i]` refers to the element at the new index `i` in the list `a`.
- **`end=' '`**: This means that instead of printing a newline character after the output, a space character is printed.

### Final Output:
The output will be the element at index `i` of the list `a`, printed twice, followed by a space. Since the exact value of `i` and the contents of `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `a[i]`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] ** (where `a[i]` is the element at the index `i` in the list `a`)
