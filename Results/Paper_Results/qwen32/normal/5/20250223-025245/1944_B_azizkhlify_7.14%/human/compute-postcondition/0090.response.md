Output State: **`r` is a list, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is the same as before, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The values of `r`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
