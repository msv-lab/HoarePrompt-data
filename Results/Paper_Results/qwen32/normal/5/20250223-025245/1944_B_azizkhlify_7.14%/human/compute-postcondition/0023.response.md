To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the specific `print` statement.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`.
- `re`, `ul`, `ur` are all initialized to 0.
- `res` is an empty list.
- The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- The value of `a[i]` is an integer from the list `a`.

### Key Points:
- The specific value of `a[i]` is not provided directly in the initial state, but it is an element of the list `a`.
- The fact that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2 indicates that the integer `a[i]` appears exactly twice in the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
Since we do not have the exact value of `a[i]`, we can only describe the output in terms of `a[i]`. The output will be the value of `a[i]` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is an element of the list a that appears exactly twice)**
