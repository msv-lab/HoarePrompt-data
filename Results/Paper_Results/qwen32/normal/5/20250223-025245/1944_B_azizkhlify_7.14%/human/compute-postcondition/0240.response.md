Postcondition: **`ul` is 4 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ul` is either 4 or 6. `ur` is 0, `re` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `i` is 2, and `res` is an empty list.**
