Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is a list where each index `j` contains the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `ul` is either 6, 4, or 2 if `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ul` remains 4, 2, or 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `k` is the second integer from the input, `re` is 0, `i` is 2. If `ul == k * 2`, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
