Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `ul`: This variable is set to 4 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2; otherwise, it remains 2.
   - `ur`: This variable is set to 0.
   - `re`: This variable is set to 0.
   - `n`: This is a positive integer.
   - `k`: This is an input integer.
   - `a`: This is a list of integers read from input.
   - `l`: This is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a`.
   - `r`: This is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`.
   - `i`: This is set to 2.
   - `res`: This is an empty list.

2. **Conditional Logic:**
   - If `ul` equals `k * 2`, the program proceeds with the if part's postcondition.
   - Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables, and the program continues.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Given that `i` is set to 2, the print statement will output the element at index 2 of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, and will not add a newline character at the end (due to `end=' '`).

### Determining the Output:

- `a[i]`: Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to the element at index 2 of the list `a`. The exact value of `a[2]` is not provided in the initial state, so we can only refer to it as `a[2]`.

### Final Output:

Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the element at index 2 of the list `a`)**
