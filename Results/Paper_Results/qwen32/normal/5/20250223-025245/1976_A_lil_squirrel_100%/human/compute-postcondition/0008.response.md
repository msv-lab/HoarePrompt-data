The only object in the loop head is the variable `ch`, which iterates over each character in the string `password`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ch` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ch` has taken on the value of the last character processed in the string `password`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ch` should be the next character in the string `password` if there are any remaining characters.

Since the loop iterates over each character in `password`, the state of `ch` at the start of the next iteration should be the next character in the sequence. The states of `n`, `password`, `letters`, and `digits` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing the character `ch` if `ch` is not a digit, and `digits` is a list containing the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, `ch` is the next character in the string `password`**
