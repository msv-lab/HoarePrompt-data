You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are digits.`
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are digits.

Both `letters` and `digits` are sorted. The loop has completed all its iterations without returning 'NO'.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it handles the condition that no digit should come after a letter. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the scenario where the password consists solely of digits or solely of letters. 

While the code correctly checks that letters and digits are sorted individually and that no digit comes after a letter, it fails to ensure that all digits are after all letters, which is a requirement. For example, in the case of a password like "a1b2", the program would incorrectly return "YES" because it only checks that no digit directly follows a letter, but does not enforce the order that all letters must come before all digits.

To correct this, we need to ensure that once we encounter a digit in the password, all subsequent characters must also be digits. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    digit_encountered = False
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
            digit_encountered = True
        else:
            if digit_encountered:
                return 'NO'  # A letter after a digit
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This version adds a `digit_encountered` flag to ensure that if a digit is found, no letters can follow it. This addresses the issue in the original code.
