### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as defined in the problem statement.

1. **Condition 1: Password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits**
   - The problem states that the input will only consist of lowercase Latin letters and digits, so this condition is implicitly satisfied by the input constraints.

2. **Condition 2: There should be no digit that comes after a letter**
   - The program checks this condition in the final loop where it iterates through the password and checks if any letter is immediately followed by a digit. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Condition 3: All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order**
   - The program creates a list of digits and checks if this list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Condition 4: All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order**
   - The program creates a list of letters and checks if this list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.

The program correctly checks all the conditions in the problem statement. Let's verify it with the provided example:

- **Testcase 1:**
  - Input: `12ac`
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - Digits: `['1', '2']` (sorted)
  - No digit comes after a letter.
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Testcase 2:**
  - Input: `123wa`
  - Letters: `['a', 'w']` (not sorted, should be `['a', 'w']` but the issue is the order of letters in the input string, which is not sorted)
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Output: `NO` (Correct, because the letters are not in non-decreasing order)

- **Testcase 3:**
  - Input: `allllmost`
  - Letters: `['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't']` (sorted)
  - Digits: `[]` (empty, so trivially sorted)
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Testcase 4:**
  - Input: `ac123`
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - However, there is a digit after a letter ('c' is followed by '1').
  - Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Testcase 5:**
  - Input: `011679`
  - Letters: `[]` (empty, so trivially sorted)
  - Digits: `['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']` (sorted)
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

Since the program correctly handles all the provided test cases and meets all the conditions for a strong password, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
