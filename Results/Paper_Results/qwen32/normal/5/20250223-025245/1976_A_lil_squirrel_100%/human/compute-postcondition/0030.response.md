The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `password`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(password) - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that the loop has just finished checking the condition for `password[i]` and `password[i + 1]`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given that the loop runs from `0` to `len(password) - 2`, the next value of `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 1. Since the previous iteration ended with `i` being some value `k` (where `0 <= k < len(password) - 1`), the next value of `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are digits. Both `letters` and `digits` are sorted. If `password[i]` is a letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'NO' for the given condition, `i` is `i + 1`**.

To make it more concrete, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was 3, then at the start of the next iteration `i` should be 4.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are digits. Both `letters` and `digits` are sorted. If `password[i]` is a letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'NO' for the given condition, `i` is 4**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we express the state in terms of `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are digits. Both `letters` and `digits` are sorted. If `password[i]` is a letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'NO' for the given condition, `i` is `i + 1`**.
