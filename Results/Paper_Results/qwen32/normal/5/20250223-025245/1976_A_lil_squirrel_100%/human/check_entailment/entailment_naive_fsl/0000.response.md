Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it handles the condition that no digit should come after a letter. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the scenario where the password consists solely of digits or solely of letters. 

While the code correctly checks that letters and digits are sorted individually and that no digit comes after a letter, it fails to ensure that all digits are after all letters, which is a requirement. For example, in the case of a password like "a1b2", the program would incorrectly return "YES" because it only checks that no digit directly follows a letter, but does not enforce the order that all letters must come before all digits.

To correct this, we need to ensure that once we encounter a digit in the password, all subsequent characters must also be digits. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    digit_encountered = False
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
            digit_encountered = True
        else:
            if digit_encountered:
                return 'NO'  # A letter after a digit
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This version adds a `digit_encountered` flag to ensure that if a digit is found, no letters can follow it. This addresses the issue in the original code.
