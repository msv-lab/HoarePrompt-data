In the given task, the for loop iterates over each character `ch` in the `password` string. The state before the loop starts includes `n`, `password`, `letters`, and `digits`. According to the loop head, the only variable that can be directly adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `password` because `ch` is an iteration variable that takes on the value of each character in `password` during each iteration.

The loop will execute if `password` is a non-empty string. Given that the problem states `password` is a string of length `n` where `1 <= n <= 20`, the loop will definitely execute as long as `password` is initialized to a string of the specified length.

However, since the task specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head only involves `ch` which is an iteration variable, there is no need to adjust `ch` itself. The only relevant variable to ensure the loop executes is `password`, which is already defined to be a string of length `n`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute. No adjustments are needed for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is an empty list, `digits` is an empty list**
