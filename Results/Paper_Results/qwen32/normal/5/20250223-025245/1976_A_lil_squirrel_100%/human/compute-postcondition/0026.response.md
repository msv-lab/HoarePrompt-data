Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are digits. Both `letters` and `digits` are sorted. At least one of the following is true for every index `i` in `password`: either `password[i]` is not a letter or `password[i + 1]` is not a digit.**
