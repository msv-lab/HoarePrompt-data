To determine what will be printed by the `print(s % M)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the calculations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, with the constraint that \(k > 0\).
   - `M` is a constant set to \(1000000007\).
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo `M`.
   - `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input across all `m` iterations.
   - `i` is set to `k-1`.
   - `s` is calculated as:
     \[
     s = c \times a \times k + c^2 \times m \times \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2}
     \]

2. **Calculation of `s % M`:**
   - `s` is a complex expression involving `c`, `a`, `k`, `m`, and their modular arithmetic.
   - The final result to be printed is `s % M`.

Given the complexity of the expression for `s`, we cannot compute an exact numerical value without knowing the specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the `f` values. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

**Output Description:**
The `print(s % M)` statement will output the value of `s` modulo `M`, where `s` is calculated based on the given formula involving `c`, `a`, `k`, and `m`.

Output: **s % M (where s = c * a * k + c^2 * m * (k * (k - 1)) // 2, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo 1000000007, a is the sum of all f values read from the input across all m iterations, k is an integer greater than 0, and M is 1000000007)**
