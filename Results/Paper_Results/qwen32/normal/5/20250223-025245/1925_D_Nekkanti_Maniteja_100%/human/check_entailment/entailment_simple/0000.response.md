Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. However, there are several issues in the program that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`. This inverse is used to calculate the probability of picking any given pair of children.
   - The program then calculates `a` as the sum of all initial friendship values.
   - The loop that updates `s` is incorrect. The expected value calculation should account for the fact that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen. The program incorrectly adds `c * i * c * m + c * a` in each iteration, which does not correctly reflect the expected value.

2. **Incorrect Formula for Expected Value:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs should be calculated based on the probability of picking each pair and the expected increase in friendship value over k excursions.
   - The correct formula involves calculating the contribution of each pair to the expected sum, considering the initial friendship value and the expected number of times the pair is chosen.

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program correctly uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers, but the formula used for the expected value is incorrect.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Correctness: **False**
