The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial state specifies that `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input, but their specific values are not given. After executing the code snippet, the values of `u`, `v`, and `f` will be updated to the new integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `s` is 0; `a` is `a + f`; `m` must be greater than 0; `u`, `v`, and `f` are the new integers read from the input; `i` is 1**.

In simpler terms, the values of `u`, `v`, and `f` have been updated to the new integers read from the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
