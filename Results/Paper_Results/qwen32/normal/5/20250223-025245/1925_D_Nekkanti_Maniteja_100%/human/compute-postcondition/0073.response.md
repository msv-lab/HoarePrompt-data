Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; for each of the t test cases, n, m, and k are integers read from the input; M is 1000000007; c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo M; a is the sum of all f values read from the input for each test case; s is the final sum calculated as c * a * k + c^2 * m * (k * (k - 1)) // 2, taken modulo M; the loop has executed t times, processing each test case as described.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, we have processed `t` test cases. For each test case, we have calculated the final sum `s` using the formula `c * a * k + c^2 * m * (k * (k - 1)) // 2`, where `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values, and `m` and `k` are as provided in the input. The result `s` is taken modulo `1000000007`. The loop has executed `t` times, once for each test case.
