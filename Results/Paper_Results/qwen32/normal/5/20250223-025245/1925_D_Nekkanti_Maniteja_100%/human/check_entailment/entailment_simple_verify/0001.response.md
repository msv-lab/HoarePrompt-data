### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program in detail to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated version.

#### Problem Analysis:

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The expected value must be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers, and the output should be \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program correctly initializes the modulus \( M \) as \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - It calculates the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) (which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\)) using the `pow` function. This is used to calculate the probability of selecting any pair.
   - It initializes `s` (sum of expected values) and `a` (sum of initial friendship values).

2. **Reading Friendships:**
   - The program correctly reads the details of each pair of friends and adds their initial friendship values to `a`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the expected value by iterating over the number of excursions (k).
   - The formula used in the loop is incorrect. The program uses \( s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a \), which does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation.

#### Correct Formula:

The correct expected value for each excursion can be calculated as follows:
- The expected contribution of a pair with initial friendship value \( f_i \) after \( k \) excursions is:
  \[
  \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( f_i + i \right) \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} = \left( f_i \cdot k + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \right) \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}
  \]
- The expected value for all pairs over \( k \) excursions can be calculated by summing the expected contributions of all pairs:
  \[
  \text{Expected Value} = \left( a \cdot k + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \cdot m \right) \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}
  \]
- This can be simplified and computed using modular arithmetic.

#### Annotated Code Review:

The annotated code shows that the program is attempting to compute the expected value using an incorrect formula. Specifically, the loop:
```python
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
```
is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
```python
s = (a * k + (k * (k - 1) // 2) * m) * c
```

#### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used for calculating the expected value.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
