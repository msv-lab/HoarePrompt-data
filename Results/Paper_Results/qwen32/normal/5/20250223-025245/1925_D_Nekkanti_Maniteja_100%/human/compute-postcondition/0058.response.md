The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `a` is `a + f`; `i` is 1; `s` is 0; `m` is greater than 0; `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input for each of the `m` iterations.**
