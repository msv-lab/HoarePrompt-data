Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input; `i` is `k + m - 1`; `s` is 0; `m` iterations have been completed; `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input for each of the `m` iterations.`**

In simple terms, after all `m` iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `a` will hold the sum of all `f` values read from the input during each iteration. The variable `i` will be `k + m - 1`, reflecting the number of iterations completed. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states, with `s` staying at 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
