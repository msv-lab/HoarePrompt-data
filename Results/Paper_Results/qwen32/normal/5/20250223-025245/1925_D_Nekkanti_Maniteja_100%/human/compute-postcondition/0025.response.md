The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. Other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input across all `m` iterations; `i` is `k`; `s` is `c * a * k + c^2 * m * (k * (k - 1)) // 2`.**
