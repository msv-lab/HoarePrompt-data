The value of `n` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `n` was 1, 2, or 3, so the new value of `n` will be 3, 4, or 5 respectively. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `c`, `i`, `a[i]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is 3, 4, or 5; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `c` is a list that now includes `x` as an additional element; `i` is 1 or greater than 1 and `a[i]` is greater than 10.**
