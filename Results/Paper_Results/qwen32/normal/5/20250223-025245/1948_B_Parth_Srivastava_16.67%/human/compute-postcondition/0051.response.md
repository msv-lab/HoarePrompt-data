The code snippet `c.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the end of the list `c`. Given the initial state, `c` already contains certain elements based on the conditions described. After appending `x`, `c` will have one more element, which is `x`.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `n` remains 1, 2, or 3 based on the conditions.
- `a` remains a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer.
- `k` remains an input integer.
- `x` remains the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10`.
- `y` remains the integer division of `a[i]` by 10.
- `c` now includes `x` as an additional element.
- `i` remains 1 or greater than 1 and `a[i]` is greater than 10.
- The conditions regarding `y` and `x` in relation to `c[n - 1]` and `n` remain as described.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is 1, 2, or 3 based on the conditions; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `c` is a list that now includes `x` as an additional element; `i` is 1 or greater than 1 and `a[i]` is greater than 10.**
