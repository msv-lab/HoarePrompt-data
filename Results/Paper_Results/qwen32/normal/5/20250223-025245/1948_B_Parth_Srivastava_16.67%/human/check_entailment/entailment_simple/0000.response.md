### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its logic to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Program Structure:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` which processes the input array `a` of length `n`.
   - The result of each test case (1 for "YES", 0 for "NO") is stored in the list `b`.
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints "YES" or "NO" based on the values stored in `b`.

2. **Function `func_1()` Analysis:**
   - It reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It then iterates through the array `a` and applies the operation to elements that are greater than 10.
   - The operation involves splitting the number into its digits and inserting them back into the array `c` at the same position.
   - The logic for splitting and inserting the digits seems flawed. It only checks if the tens digit is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if the digits are in non-decreasing order, which is not sufficient to ensure that the entire array can be sorted.
   - After processing, it checks if the modified array `c` is sorted and appends 1 to `b` if it is, otherwise appends 0.

3. **Issues with the Logic:**
   - The function does not correctly handle the insertion of digits in a way that guarantees the array can be sorted.
   - The condition `if y >= c[n - 1]` and the subsequent checks are not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted in all cases.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The function may not correctly handle the insertion of digits to make the array `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]` and then sorting it to `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve recursively splitting the numbers and checking if the resulting array can be sorted.
   - This typically involves a more complex algorithm, such as backtracking or dynamic programming, to ensure that all possible splits are considered.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the logic in `func_1()`, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
