The code snippet `c.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `c`. Since `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `c` was initially an empty list, `c` now contains one element, which is `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is `int(a[i] / 10)`; `c` is a list containing `a[i]`; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is greater than 10; `y` is greater than `x`**.
