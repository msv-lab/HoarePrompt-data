Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is either 1 or 3; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `c` is a list containing either `a[i]` if `y > x` or the integers `y` and `x` if `y <= x`; `i` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10; if `y >= c[n - 1]` and `n` is 1, then `y` is greater than `x`; if `y >= c[n - 1]` and `n` is 3, then `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]` and less than or equal to `x`.**
