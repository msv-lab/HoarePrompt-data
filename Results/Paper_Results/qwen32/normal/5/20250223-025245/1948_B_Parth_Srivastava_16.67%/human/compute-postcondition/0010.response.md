The code snippet `y = int(a[i] / 10)` divides the integer `a[i]` by 10 and then converts the result to an integer, effectively removing the last digit of `a[i]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10`.
- `y` is 0.
- `c` is an empty list.
- `i` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10.

After executing the code snippet, `y` is updated to the integer division of `a[i]` by 10. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `c` is an empty list; `i` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10.**
