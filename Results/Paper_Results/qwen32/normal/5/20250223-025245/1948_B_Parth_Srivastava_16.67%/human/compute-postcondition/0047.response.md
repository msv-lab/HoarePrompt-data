Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 based on the conditions; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `c` is a list that contains either `a[i]` if `y > x` and `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, or the integers `y` and `x` if `y <= x` and `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, or the integers `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x` and `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, or `c` is a list containing `a[i]` if `i` is 0 or `a[i]` is not greater than 10, and if `y <= x`, `c` also contains `y` and `x`; `i` is 1 or greater than 1 and `a[i]` is greater than 10. If `y >= c[n - 2]` and `n` is 2, then `y` is greater than `x`. If `y >= c[n - 2]` and `n` is 4, then `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 2]` and less than or equal to `x`. If `y >= c[n - 1]` and `n` was 1, then `y` is greater than `x`. If `y >= c[n - 1]` and `n` was 3, then `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]` and less than or equal to `x`. If `y < c[n - 1]`, then no changes are made to `n`, `c`, `x`, or `y` based on the given conditions.**
