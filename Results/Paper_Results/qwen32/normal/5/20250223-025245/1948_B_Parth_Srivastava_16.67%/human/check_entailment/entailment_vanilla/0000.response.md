Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input and determine if the array can be sorted.
   - The results (1 for YES, 0 for NO) are stored in list `b`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints "YES" or "NO" based on the values in `b`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - Reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - Initializes an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - Iterates through each element in `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and not the first element, it attempts to split it into digits `y` (tens place) and `x` (units place).
     - The logic for inserting these digits into `c` is flawed:
       - It checks if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `c` (which is not always correct).
       - It incorrectly assumes that if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, the digits can be inserted in order.
       - It fails to handle cases where splitting an element results in an array that can still be sorted.
   - After processing all elements, it checks if the transformed list `c` is sorted.
   - Appends 1 to `b` if `c` is sorted, otherwise appends 0.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for splitting and inserting digits is incorrect. The program does not correctly handle all cases where splitting an element can result in a sorted array.
- The condition `if y >= c[n - 1]` is not always correct for determining if the digits should be inserted in order.
- The program does not consider all possible ways to split elements and rearrange the array to achieve a sorted order.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic for splitting and inserting digits, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted for all possible cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
