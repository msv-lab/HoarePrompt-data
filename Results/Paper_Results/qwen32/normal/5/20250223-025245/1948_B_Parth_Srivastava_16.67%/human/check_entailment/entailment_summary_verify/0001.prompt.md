You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `k`, followed by a list of integers `a`. It processes the list `a` by potentially splitting certain elements and then checks if the resulting list `c` is sorted. It appends `1` to a list `b` if `c` is sorted, otherwise it appends `0`. The function does not explicitly return a value but modifies the list `b` based on the sorted state of `c`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not properly handle the scenario where splitting a number results in a sequence that can be sorted by further splitting other numbers. The program only checks if the current sequence can be sorted after splitting numbers, but it doesn't explore if further splits on other numbers can lead to a sorted sequence.

Let's consider an example where the program will fail:

**Input:**
```
1
4
21 30 12 15
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- We can split 21 into 2 and 1, resulting in the array [2, 1, 30, 12, 15].
- Then we can split 30 into 3 and 0, resulting in the array [2, 1, 3, 0, 12, 15].
- Further, we can split 12 into 1 and 2, resulting in the array [2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 15].
- Finally, we can split 15 into 1 and 5, resulting in the array [2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 5].
- This array can be sorted to [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5].

However, the provided program will likely not handle this correctly because it does not explore all possible splits and their combinations to determine if a sorted sequence can be achieved.

**Program's Incorrect Behavior:**
The program does not recursively or exhaustively check all possible sequences resulting from splitting numbers. It only checks the immediate result of splitting numbers once and does not consider further splits that could lead to a sorted sequence.

To fix this, the program would need to implement a more comprehensive approach, possibly using recursion or a more sophisticated algorithm to explore all possible sequences resulting from splitting numbers and check if any of them can be sorted.
