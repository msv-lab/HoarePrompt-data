Let's break down the provided initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: This variable is defined as `t + (n - 1)`. However, the initial value of `t` is not provided, but since it's being updated by adding `(n - 1)`, we know that `t` will be some integer value after this operation.

2. **`n`**: This is an input integer such that `2 <= n <= 500`. This means `n` can be any integer between 2 and 500, inclusive.

3. **`x`**: This is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`. Note that this list `x` is mentioned but not used in the given code snippet.

4. **`T`**: This is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`. Since the exact content of `line` is not provided, we can't determine the exact values of `T`. However, we know `T` is a list of integers.

5. **`a`**: This is a list constructed based on `T`. Specifically, `a` contains the elements `[1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[i-1]]` for all `1 <= i <= n-1`. This means `a` is a cumulative sum list starting from 1000, where each subsequent element is the previous element plus the next element in `T`.

6. **`result`**: This is a string formed by joining the elements of `a` with spaces. So, `result` will be a string like `"1000 1000+T[0] 1000+T[0]+T[1] ... 1000+T[0]+T[1]+...+T[n-2]"`.

7. **`line`**: This is the input string that gets split and converted into the list `T`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Explanation:
The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result`, which is the concatenation of the elements in the list `a`, separated by spaces. Each element in `a` is a cumulative sum starting from 1000 and adding the elements of `T` sequentially.

### Output:
Given the above explanation, the output will be a string of space-separated values starting from 1000, with each subsequent value being the previous value plus the next element in `T`.

Output: **"1000 1000+T[0] 1000+T[0]+T[1] ... 1000+T[0]+T[1]+...+T[n-2]" (where each element in the list a is a cumulative sum starting from 1000 and adding the elements of T sequentially)**

Since the exact values of `T` are not provided, we can't give a numerical output. However, the structure of the output is clear based on the given information.
