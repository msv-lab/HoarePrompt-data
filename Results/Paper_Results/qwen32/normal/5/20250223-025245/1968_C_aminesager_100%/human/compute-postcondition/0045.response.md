Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a list with `n` elements where:
   - The first element is `1000`.
   - Each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of `1000` and the elements of `T` up to that point.

2. `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a` converted to strings.

### Key Points:
- The list `a` starts with `1000` as its first element.
- Each subsequent element of `a` is calculated as the cumulative sum of `1000` and the elements of `T` up to that point.
- `result` is a space-separated string of all elements in `a`.

### Example Calculation:
Suppose `T` is a list of integers, for example, `[200, 300, 400]`. The list `a` would be calculated as follows:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + 200 = 1200`
- `a[2] = 1000 + 200 + 300 = 1500`
- `a[3] = 1000 + 200 + 300 + 400 = 1900`

Thus, `a` would be `[1000, 1200, 1500, 1900]`.

### Conversion to `result`:
- `result` would be the space-separated string of the elements in `a`, so `result` would be `"1000 1200 1500 1900"`.

### General Case:
Given the general initial state, the exact elements of `a` depend on the list `T`. However, we know that the first element is always `1000`, and each subsequent element is a cumulative sum involving `1000` and elements of `T`.

### Final Output Description:
The `print(result)` statement will output a space-separated string of the elements in the list `a`, where the first element is `1000`, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of `1000` and the elements of `T` up to that point.

Output: **result (where result is a space-separated string of the elements in the list `a`, with the first element being `1000` and each subsequent element being the cumulative sum of `1000` and the elements of `T` up to that point)**
