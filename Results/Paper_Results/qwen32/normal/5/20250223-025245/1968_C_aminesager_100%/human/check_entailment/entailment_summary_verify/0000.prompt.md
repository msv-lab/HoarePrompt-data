You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a new list `a` such that each element `a[i]` is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list, starting with `a[0]` initialized to 1000. It then prints the resulting list `a` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. Specifically, the current implementation initializes `a` with `[1000]` and then calculates subsequent elements by adding the corresponding `x_i` to the previous element in `a`. However, this approach does not guarantee that `a_i % a_(i-1) = x_i` for all `i >= 2`.

Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
The program should output any array `a_1, a_2, a_3` such that:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 1`
- `a_3 % a_2 = 1`

For example, a valid output could be:
```
2 3 4
```
or
```
5 6 7
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program will output something like:
```
1000 1001 1002
```

However, this output is not correct because:
- `1001 % 1000 = 1` (which is correct)
- `1002 % 1001 = 1` (which is correct)

But, the initial value `1000` is arbitrary and does not necessarily lead to a valid solution for all inputs. For instance, if the input is `1 500`, the program will output `1000 1500`, which does not satisfy `1500 % 1000 = 500`.

To fix this, a more appropriate approach is to choose `a_1` to be any number greater than the maximum `x_i` (to ensure all `x_i` can be remainders) and then set `a_i = a_(i-1) + x_i` for `i >= 2`. However, a simpler and more reliable approach is to set `a_1` to `x_1 + 1` and `a_i = a_(i-1) + x_i` for `i >= 2`, ensuring that `a_i % a_(i-1) = x_i` holds true.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [T[0] + 1]  # a_1 should be greater than x_1
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the conditions are met for all test cases.
