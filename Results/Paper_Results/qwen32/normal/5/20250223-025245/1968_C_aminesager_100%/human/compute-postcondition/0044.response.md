Output State: **`a` is a list with `n` elements where the first element is `1000` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of `1000` and the elements of `T` up to that point; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a` converted to strings.**

In simpler terms:
- The list `a` remains unchanged, containing `n` elements where the first element is `1000` and each subsequent element is a cumulative sum.
- The variable `result` is now a string that contains all the elements of `a`, separated by spaces, with each element converted to a string.
