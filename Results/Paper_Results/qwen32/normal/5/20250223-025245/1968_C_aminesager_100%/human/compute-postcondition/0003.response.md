The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to the integer value obtained from the input. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500. After the code execution, `n` will hold the specific integer value provided by the input, while the other variables (`t` and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500; `x` is a list of n-1 integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
