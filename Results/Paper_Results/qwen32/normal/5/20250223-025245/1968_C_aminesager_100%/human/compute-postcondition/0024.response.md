The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t - 1` and `n` remains the same input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be `t`.

State: **`t` is `t`, `n` remains the same input integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `x` remains the same list of n-1 integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements `[1000, 1000 + T[i - 1]]`, `result` is a string formed by joining the elements of `a` with spaces, `line` is the input string**
