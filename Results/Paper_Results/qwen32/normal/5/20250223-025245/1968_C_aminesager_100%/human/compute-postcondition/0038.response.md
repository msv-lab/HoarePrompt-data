The code snippet appends the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `T[i - 1]` to the list `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but the list `a` is modified by adding a new element.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` has a new element which is `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` appended to it.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains greater than 1. The list `a` now includes an additional element, which is the sum of the element at index `i - 1` in `a` and the element at index `i - 1` in `T`.
