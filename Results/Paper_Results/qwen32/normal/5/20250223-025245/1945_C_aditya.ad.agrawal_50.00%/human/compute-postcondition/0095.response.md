The code snippet provided decrements the value of `o_r` by 1. Therefore, the value of `o_r` is reduced by 1 from its previous value. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string that can be converted to a list with at least one integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` with at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `i` is the element at position `pos` in `arr`, `pos` is incremented by 1, `o_l` is incremented by 1, `o_r` is decremented by 1.**
