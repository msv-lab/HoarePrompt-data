Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The function receives multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses and a string a of length n consisting only of 0s and 1s, where a_j = 0 if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street, and a_j = 1 if the resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    input_string = input()
    arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
    z = arr.count(0)
    o = arr.count(1)
    z_r = z
    o_r = o
    z_l = 0
    o_l = 0
    dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
        b_d = dist
    else:
        b_d = 30001
    for i in arr:
        pos += 1
        if i == 0:
            z_l += 1
            z_r -= 1
        else:
            o_l += 1
            o_r -= 1
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(
            n / 2 - pos):
            ans = pos
            b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string`; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_r` is 0; `o_r` is 0; `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` were last met; `pos` is the length of `arr`; `b_d` is the minimum distance from `n / 2` to any position `pos` where the conditions were met.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0 minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string that can be converted to a list with integers, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is the position closest to the midpoint where the conditions are met, `pos` is the length of `arr`, `b_d` is the minimum distance to the midpoint where the conditions are met.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
