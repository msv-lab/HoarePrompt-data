The code snippet provided is `o_r -= 1`, which decrements the value of the variable `o_r` by 1. The other variables and their initial states remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code.

Given the initial state, the only variable that will be affected is `o_r`. Since there is no specific value provided for `o_r`, we can only state that it will be one less than its initial value.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string that can be converted to a list with at least one integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` with at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is incremented by 1, `o_l` is incremented by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1.**
