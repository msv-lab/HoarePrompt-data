Postcondition: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new input string, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least two elements, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 2 if `i` was initially 0, otherwise `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 1 if `i` was 0, otherwise `o_l` is 2, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 2 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 2 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 1, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 2. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, then `ans` is set to 1 and `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. `i` is the next element in `arr`. If `i` was 0, `z_l` is 2 and `z_r` is decremented by 2, otherwise `o_l` is 2 and `o_r` is decremented by 2.**
