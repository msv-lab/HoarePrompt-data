The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For the `while t:` loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 right before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
