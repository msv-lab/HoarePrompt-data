The code snippet `ans = pos` assigns the value of `pos` to `ans`. Given that `pos` is initially set to 2, `ans` will now have the value 2. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new input string, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least two elements, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 2 if `i` was initially 0, otherwise `z_l` is 1, `o_l` is 1 if `i` was 0, otherwise `o_l` is 2, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 2 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 2 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 1, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 2, `ans` is 2.**
