Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting a character from `input_string` to an integer; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o_r` is equal to `o`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is 0; `pos` is 0; `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`; otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string with at least one character; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one integer; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`. If `i` is 0, then `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1, `o_r` remains the same, `z_l` is 1, and `o_l` is 0. If `i` is not 0, then `z_r` remains the same, `o_r` is the previous `o_r` minus 1, `z_l` is 0, and `o_l` is 1. In both cases, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 1, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string with at least one character; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one integer; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`. `i` is the next element in `arr`. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1. `pos` is increased by 1; `o_r`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `dist`, `b_d`, and `ans` remain as per their definitions based on the new value of `i`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is equal to `pos` and `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. Otherwise, `ans` and `b_d` remain as per their previous definitions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string with at least one character, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one integer, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `i` is `arr[pos]`, `pos` is increased by 1, `dist`, `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r`, and `ans` are adjusted based on the new value of `i`. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `(b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, then `ans` is now equal to `pos` and `b_d` is now equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
