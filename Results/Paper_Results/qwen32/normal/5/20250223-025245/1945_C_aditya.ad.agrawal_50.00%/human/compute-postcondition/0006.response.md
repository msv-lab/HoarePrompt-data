The code snippet `o = arr.count(1)` counts the number of times the integer `1` appears in the list `arr`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, or `z`. The only variable that changes is `o`, which is assigned the count of `1`s in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting a character from `input_string` to an integer; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`.**
