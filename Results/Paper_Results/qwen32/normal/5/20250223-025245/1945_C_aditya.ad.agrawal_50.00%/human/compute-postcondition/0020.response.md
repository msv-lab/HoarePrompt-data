The code snippet `z_l += 1` increments the value of `z_l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `z_l` was initially 0, it will now be 1. The other variables retain their initial values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string with at least one character; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one integer; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o_r` is equal to `o`; `z_l` is 1; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is 0; `pos` is 1; `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`; otherwise, `b_d` is 30001`; `i` is 0.**
