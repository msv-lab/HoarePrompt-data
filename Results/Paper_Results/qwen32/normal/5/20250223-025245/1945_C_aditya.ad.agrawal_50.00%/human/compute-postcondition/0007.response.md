The code snippet provided assigns the value of `z` to `z_r`. This means that `z_r` will now hold the same value as `z`, which is the count of 0s in the list `arr`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting a character from `input_string` to an integer; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`.**
