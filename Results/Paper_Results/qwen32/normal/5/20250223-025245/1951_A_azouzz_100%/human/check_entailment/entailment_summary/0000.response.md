Reasoning:  
The provided problem description and the given Python program do not match. The problem description describes a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that scans subdirectories within the current directory, checks if their names are within a specified range, and generates specific files for HTML files found within those directories. 

On the other hand, the provided program defines a function `func_1` that reads input values, counts the occurrences of '1' in a given string, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions related to the count of '1's and the presence of the substring '11'. This function is called when the script is run as the main program.

Since the program does not perform the actions described in the problem statement, it is incorrect according to the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
