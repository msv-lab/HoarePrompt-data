The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to a new variable `t`. This does not affect the existing variables `start` and `end`, which remain integers such that `start <= end`. The output state includes the new variable `t` with the value provided by the user input converted to an integer.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer.**
