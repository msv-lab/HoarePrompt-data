Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration before it was decremented; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. Regardless of whether '11' is in `s`, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged if `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` also remain unchanged.**
