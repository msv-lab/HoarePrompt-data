The function reads an integer `t` from the user, then for each of the next `t` iterations, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s`. It counts the number of '1's in `s` and prints 'YES' if the count is even and greater than 2, or if there is at most one '1' and no '11' substring in `s`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value explicitly.
