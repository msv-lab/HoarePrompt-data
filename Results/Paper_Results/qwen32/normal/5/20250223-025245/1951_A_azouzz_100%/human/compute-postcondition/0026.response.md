The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state provides several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. This statement directly outputs the string 'YES'.
3. None of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1` are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not influence the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
