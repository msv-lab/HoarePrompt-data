The given initial state describes several variables and their properties, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables. The statement `print('YES')` will simply print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`), but these are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`, which means it will output the string 'YES'.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
