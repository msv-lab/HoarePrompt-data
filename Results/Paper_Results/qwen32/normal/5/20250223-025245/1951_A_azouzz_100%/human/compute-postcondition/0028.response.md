The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output of this statement.

Output: **NO**
