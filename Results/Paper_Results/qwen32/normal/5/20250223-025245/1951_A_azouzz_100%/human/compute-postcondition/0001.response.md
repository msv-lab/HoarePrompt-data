The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which determines how many times the loop will execute. The variables `start` and `end` are not directly involved in the loop's execution count and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. The values of `start` and `end` can remain as they are since they are not part of the loop's condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
