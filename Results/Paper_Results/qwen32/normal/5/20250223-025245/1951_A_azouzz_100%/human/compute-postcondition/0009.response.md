The `print` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1`. The statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The initial state provides several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`) with specific conditions and relationships, but these do not influence the `print` statement directly.
2. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`, which outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Thus, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **NO**
