The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables described in the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the `print` statement**: The statement is `print('NO')`.
2. **Determine the content to be printed**: The content to be printed is the string `'NO'`.
3. **Check dependencies**: The `print` statement does not reference any variables or objects from the initial state, so the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` do not influence the output.

Thus, the output will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
