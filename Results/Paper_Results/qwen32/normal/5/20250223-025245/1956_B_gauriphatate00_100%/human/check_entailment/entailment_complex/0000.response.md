### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can score in a card game where you and Nene each have `n` cards with integers from `1` to `n` (each integer appears exactly twice in the deck). Points are awarded when a player places a card that already has a matching card on the table.

The provided program calculates the number of unique integers in your hand that appear exactly twice. This is the maximum number of points you can score if you and Nene play optimally, because each pair of identical cards can contribute at most one point to your score (the second time you place a card with a number that is already on the table).

Let's break down the logic:
- The program counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand using a dictionary `count_a`.
- It then iterates through all integers from `1` to `n` and checks if they appear exactly twice in your hand.
- For each integer that appears exactly twice, it increments `max_score` by 1.
- Finally, it returns `max_score`, which represents the maximum number of points you can score.

This approach is correct because:
- If a number appears exactly twice in your hand, you can place one of the cards, and when you place the second card, you get a point.
- Nene's optimal strategy, as described, does not affect this count because you are only concerned with the pairs in your own hand.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
