Postcondition: **`count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. `n` is greater than 0. `num` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `num` is a key in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, then `max_score` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `max_score` remains unchanged.**
