The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a` and the variable `num`. Since `num` takes the value of the next element in the list `a` in each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least one more element that `num` can take.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, and `num` is an integer that was the last element of `a` processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least one more element.

State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `num` is the next integer in the list `a` after the previously processed one**.
