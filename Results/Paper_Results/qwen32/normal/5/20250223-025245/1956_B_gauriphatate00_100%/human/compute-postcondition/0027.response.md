The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `num` is in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was incremented by 1, so for the next iteration, `num` should be the next integer in the sequence. If `num` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `num` should be `k + 1`.

Since the loop condition is `for num in range(1, n + 1)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `num` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we can conclude that at the start of the next iteration, `num` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. `n` is greater than 0. `num` is the value from the previous iteration incremented by 1. If `num` is in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is 2, then `max_score` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `max_score` remains unchanged.**

Since we are only adjusting `num`:
State: **`count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. `n` is greater than 0. `num` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
