Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `count_a` is an empty dictionary.**

In this output state, the list `a` retains its initial properties, and a new variable `count_a` is introduced as an empty dictionary.
