Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of pairs of cards you have, but it does not simulate the game where both players play optimally to maximize their scores.

Here's a detailed explanation of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Optimal Play Simulation**: The problem states that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and, in case of a tie, to minimize your score. The provided code does not simulate this optimal play. It just counts the number of pairs you have, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum score you can get if Nene plays optimally.

2. **Game Strategy**: The game strategy involves both players making choices based on the current state of the table and the cards they have. The provided code does not account for this strategy.

3. **Example Case**: Let's consider the following test case:
   ```
   2
   2
   1 2
   2
   1 1
   ```
   - For the first test case, you have cards [1, 2] and Nene has cards [1, 2]. If both play optimally, you can get 1 point (if you play 1 and Nene plays 1, then you play 2 and Nene plays 2).
   - For the second test case, you have cards [1, 1] and Nene has cards [1, 1]. If both play optimally, you cannot get any points because Nene will always play the second 1 when you play the first 1.

The provided code would output `1` for both test cases, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` for the first test case and `0` for the second test case.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to simulate the game with both players playing optimally, which involves more complex logic than simply counting pairs.
