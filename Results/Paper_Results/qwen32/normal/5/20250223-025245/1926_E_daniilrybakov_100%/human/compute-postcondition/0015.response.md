The code snippet `n //= 2` modifies the value of `n` by performing integer division by 2. This means `n` will be updated to half of its original value, rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4
- `n` is at least 2
- `k` is an input integer
- `s` is `x`
- `m` is 2
- `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`

After executing `n //= 2`, the value of `n` changes. The values of `t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n` is at least 1; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `x`; `m` is 2; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` before the operation, now `n` is `n // 2`.**
