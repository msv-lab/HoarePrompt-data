To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the variables and their transformations based on the provided initial state and the operations described.

### Initial State and Transformations:
- `t`: remains the same as the initial input integer.
- `n`: starts at 0 (initially set to 0).
- `k`: remains the same as the initial input integer.
- `s`: is the sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
- `m`: is `2^i` where `i` is the number of iterations.
- `_`: remains 1 (this variable does not affect the output).

### Key Points:
- Since `n` is initially set to 0, the loop condition (`n` becomes 0) is already met, and the loop does not execute at all.
- As a result, `s` remains 0 (since no iterations occur to add to `s`).
- `m` remains 1 (since no iterations occur to double `m`).

### Output Calculation:
Given the loop does not execute:
- `s` remains 0.
- `m` remains 1.

Now, substituting these values into the print statement:
```python
print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)
```
- `k` is the initial input integer.
- `s` is 0.
- `m` is 1.

So, the expression simplifies to:
```python
print((2 * (k - 0) - 1) * 1)
```
Which further simplifies to:
```python
print((2 * k - 1) * 1)
```
And finally:
```python
print(2 * k - 1)
```

### Final Output:
The print statement will output `2 * k - 1`.

Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is the initial input integer)**
