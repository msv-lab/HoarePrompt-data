The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. However, the loop's execution depends on the variable `t`, which determines the number of iterations.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4
- `n` is 0
- `k` is an input integer
- `s` is the accumulated sum of `(n + 1) // 2` values from each iteration
- `m` is `2^i`, where `i` is the number of iterations the loop has executed

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- The loop will execute `t` times. After each iteration, `t` effectively decreases by 1 because the loop uses `range(t)`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is 0; `k` is an input integer; `s` is the accumulated sum of `(n + 1) // 2` values from each iteration; `m` is `2^i`, where `i` is the number of iterations the loop has executed**
