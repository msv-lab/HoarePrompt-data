The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only exits the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `x`; `m` is 2; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` before the operation, now `n` is `n // 2`.**
