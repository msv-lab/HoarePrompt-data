Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 1 (specifically, `n` is the floor of its original value divided by 2); `k` is the second input integer; `s` is `s + x`; `m` is 2; `_` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, `_`, and `x` remain unchanged, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
