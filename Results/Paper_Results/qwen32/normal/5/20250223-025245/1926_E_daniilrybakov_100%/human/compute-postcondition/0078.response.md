The code snippet `n //= 2` divides the value of `n` by 2 using integer division and assigns the result back to `n`. This will change the value of `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1
- `n` must be at least 2
- `k` is the second input integer
- `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`
- `m` is 4
- `_` is 1
- `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`

After executing `n //= 2`, the value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is the second input integer; `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`; `m` is 4; `_` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
