Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(test_cases):
    n = int(input())
    num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
    num_of_lens = {}
    for x in num_list:
        if x in num_of_lens:
            num_of_lens[x] += 1
        else:
            num_of_lens[x] = 1
    res = 0
    total_count = 0
    for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
        if cnt >= 3:
            res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
        if cnt >= 2:
            res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
        total_count += cnt
    results.append(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is the sum of all contributions from each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `num_list` remains unchanged, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens.values()`, `results` contains `res` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each unique element in `num_list` is a key, and the value is the count of that element in `num_list`, `res` is the accumulated sum of combinations of elements based on their counts, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, and `results` contains the final `res` as its last element, with `res` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
