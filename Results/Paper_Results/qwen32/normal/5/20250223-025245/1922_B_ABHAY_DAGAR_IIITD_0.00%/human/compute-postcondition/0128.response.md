To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior and accumulation of variables within the loop. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `test_cases` is 1 (remains unchanged).
   - `n` is an input integer (remains unchanged).
   - `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input (remains unchanged).
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each unique element in `num_list` is a key, and the value is the count of that element in `num_list` (remains unchanged).
   - `res` is 0 (will accumulate values based on the loop).
   - `total_count` is 0 (will accumulate values based on the loop).
   - `results` contains `res` as its last element (will be updated with the final `res`).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - For each `cnt`:
     - If `cnt >= 3`, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
     - If `cnt >= 2`, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
     - `total_count` is incremented by `cnt`.

3. **Final State:**
   - `test_cases` remains 1.
   - `n` remains the input integer.
   - `num_list` remains the list of integers converted from the input.
   - `num_of_lens` remains the dictionary with counts of unique elements in `num_list`.
   - `res` accumulates the sum of combinations of elements based on their counts.
   - `total_count` accumulates the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.
   - `results` is updated to contain the final `res`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each unique element in `num_list` is a key, and the value is the count of that element in `num_list`, `res` is the accumulated sum of combinations of elements based on their counts, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, and `results` contains the final `res` as its last element.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop finishes executing, the final output state includes:
- `test_cases` still set to 1.
- `n` remains the input integer provided initially.
- `num_list` remains the list of integers derived from the input.
- `num_of_lens` remains the dictionary with counts of each unique integer in `num_list`.
- `res` contains the total accumulated value from the combinations of elements based on their counts.
- `total_count` is the sum of all counts of elements in `num_of_lens`.
- `results` is updated to include the final value of `res` as its last element.
