The code provided updates `num_list` by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual components, converting each component to an integer, and storing these integers in a list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens.values()`, `results` contains `res` as its last element.**

In simple terms, `num_list` is now a list of integers obtained from the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
