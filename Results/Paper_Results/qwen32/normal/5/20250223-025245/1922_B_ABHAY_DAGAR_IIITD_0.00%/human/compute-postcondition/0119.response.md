The code snippet updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. The condition regarding the update of `res` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3 does not affect this particular line of code, so it is not relevant here.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count` + `cnt`, `results` contains `res` as its last element, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**
