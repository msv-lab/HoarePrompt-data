Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the updated total count based on the previous `cnt` plus `cnt`, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is further updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the updated total count based on the previous `cnt` plus `cnt`, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `cnt` is `next_cnt` where `next_cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is less than 3, no additional updates are made to `res` based on the condition `cnt >= 3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
