The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. The initial state indicates that `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The execution of the code snippet does not affect the `test_cases` variable. The only change is the creation of the `results` list, which is initially empty.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `results` is an empty list.**
