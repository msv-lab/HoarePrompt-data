Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing, `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary that keeps track of how many times each number in `num_list` appears. All other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
