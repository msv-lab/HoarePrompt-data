Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each unique element in `num_list` is a key, and the value is the count of that element in `num_list`, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0, `results` contains `res` as its last element.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count` + `cnt`, and `results` contains `res` as its last element. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, then `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0. If `cnt` is less than 2, no changes are made to `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the previous `total_count` + `cnt`, `results` contains `res` as its last element, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the previous `total_count` + `cnt` + `cnt`, `results` contains `res` as its last element. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is the previous `res` + `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to the previous `res` + `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
