Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The program only counts combinations of sticks with the same length and combinations of two sticks with the same length and one different length, but it does not check the triangle inequality condition, which is essential for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
The lengths of the sticks are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), and \(2^3 = 8\). The only combination of three sticks is \([2, 4, 8]\). To form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. However, \(2 + 4 \not> 8\), so these sticks cannot form a triangle. Therefore, the output should be `0`.

The provided program would incorrectly count this combination as a valid triangle because it does not check the triangle inequality condition.

Thus, the program is **False**.
