Output State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count` + `cnt`, and `results` contains `res` as its last element. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, then `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0. If `cnt` is less than 2, no changes are made to `res`.**

In simpler terms, `total_count` has been updated to include the value of `cnt`. All other variables retain their initial states and conditions.
