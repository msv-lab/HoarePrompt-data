The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. This means that after the execution, `num_of_lens` will have a new key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is `1`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must contain at least one integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is `1`; `x` is a key in `num_of_lens`.**
