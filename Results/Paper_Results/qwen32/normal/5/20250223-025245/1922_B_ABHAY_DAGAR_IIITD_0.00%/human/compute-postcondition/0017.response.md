The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` by setting the value associated with the key `x` to 1. The value of `x` is the third element in the list `num_list`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least two integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` (the third element in `num_list`) set to 1, `x` is the third element in `num_list`.**
