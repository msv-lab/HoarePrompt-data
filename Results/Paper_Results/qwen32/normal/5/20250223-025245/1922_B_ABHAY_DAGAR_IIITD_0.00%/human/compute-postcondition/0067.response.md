The code snippet `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` updates the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. Since `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, the expression calculates a specific value to be added to `res`.

Output State: **`test_cases` will be 0, `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair (e.g., `{1: 1}`), `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `total_count` is 0, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**
