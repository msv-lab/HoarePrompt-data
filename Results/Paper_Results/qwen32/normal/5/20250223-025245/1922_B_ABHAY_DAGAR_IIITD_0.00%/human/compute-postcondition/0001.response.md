The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not plan to use. The loop will iterate `_` in the range of `test_cases`. However, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, not an integer, so we need to adjust the state to make sure `test_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases.

To ensure the loop can execute, `test_cases` should be an integer greater than or equal to 1. The underscore `_` does not need to be adjusted since it is just a placeholder.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list**
