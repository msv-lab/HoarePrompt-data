The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which iterates over the elements of `num_list`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` for the next iteration of the loop. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` has taken the value of the last element in `num_list` that was processed. To proceed to the next iteration, `x` should take the value of the next element in `num_list`.

Given:
- `test_cases` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input and must have at least 1 element
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key, and its value is incremented or added as described
- `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()`
- `total_count` is incremented or set as described
- `results` contains `res` as its last element

Since the loop iterates over `num_list`, and assuming the previous iteration processed the `k`-th element of `num_list`, the next iteration should process the `(k+1)`-th element.

State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input and must have at least 1 element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key, `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_count` is incremented by 1 if `x` was already in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not in `num_of_lens`, and `results` contains `res` as its last element, `x` is the next element in `num_list`**.

Since we do not have the specific index of the last processed element, we can denote the next element in `num_list` as `num_list[k+1]` where `k` is the index of the last processed element. However, without loss of generality, we can simply state that `x` is the next element in `num_list`.
