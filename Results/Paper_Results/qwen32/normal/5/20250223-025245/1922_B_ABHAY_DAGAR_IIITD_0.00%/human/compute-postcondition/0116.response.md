The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, we need to adjust `cnt` for the next iteration. The state of `num_of_lens` and its values will determine whether the loop can execute again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `test_cases` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair
- `total_count` is `total_count` + `cnt`
- `results` contains `res` as its last element
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, then `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.
- If `cnt` is less than 2, no changes are made to `res`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` has taken on one of the values from `num_of_lens.values()`. For the loop to execute again, there must be another value in `num_of_lens.values()` that `cnt` can take.

Let's assume that the current `cnt` value has been processed, and we need to move to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. We do not know the exact values in `num_of_lens`, but we know that `cnt` needs to be updated to the next value in the dictionary.

State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count` + `cnt`, `results` contains `res` as its last element, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.

Since we do not have the specific values of `num_of_lens`, we cannot determine the exact next value of `cnt`. However, we know that `cnt` will be updated to the next value in the iteration over `num_of_lens.values()`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count` + `cnt`, `results` contains `res` as its last element, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.
