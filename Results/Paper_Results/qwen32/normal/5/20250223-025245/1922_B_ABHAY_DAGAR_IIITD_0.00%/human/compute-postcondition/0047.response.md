The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`. This operation does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `n`, or `num_list`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.**
