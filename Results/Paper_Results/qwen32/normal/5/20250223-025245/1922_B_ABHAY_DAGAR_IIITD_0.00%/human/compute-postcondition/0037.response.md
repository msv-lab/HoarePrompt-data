The code snippet provided updates the variable `res` by adding the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the updated total count based on the previous `cnt` plus `cnt`, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is further updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `cnt` is `next_cnt` where `next_cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, and all other variables retain their initial values or states.
