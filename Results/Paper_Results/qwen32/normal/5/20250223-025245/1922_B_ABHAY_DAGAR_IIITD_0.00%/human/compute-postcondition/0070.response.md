Output State: **`test_cases` will be 0, `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair (e.g., `{1: 1}`), `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, and `total_count` is 0.**

In simple terms, the value of `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. Since `total_count` is 0, the value of `res` does not change. All other variables remain unchanged.
