The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, we need to adjust `cnt` to the next value in the dictionary for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` has just been used in the loop body, and we need to move to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

Let's denote the current value of `cnt` as `cnt_current`. The next value in `num_of_lens.values()` will be `cnt_next`.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt_current`. If `cnt_current` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt_current * (cnt_current - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `cnt` is `cnt_next`**

However, since we do not have the specific values of `cnt_current` and `cnt_next`, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the updated total count based on the previous `cnt`, `res` is updated if the previous `cnt` was greater than or equal to 2, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**
