Output State: **`test_cases` is 0, `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt` (where `cnt` was the value from the previous iteration), `res` is `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.**

In simple terms, the value of `res` has been updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
