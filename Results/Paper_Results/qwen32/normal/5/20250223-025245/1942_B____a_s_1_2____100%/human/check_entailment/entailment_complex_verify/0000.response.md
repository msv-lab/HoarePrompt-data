Let's carefully analyze the problem statement, the provided code, the annotated version, and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to construct a permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \) such that each \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

### Code Analysis

Here is the provided code with annotations:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

### Annotations

- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
- It initializes `p` with `-1` and `mex` with `n`.
- It iterates from the end of `a` to the beginning, calculating each `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and updating `mex` to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.
- Finally, it prints the constructed permutation `p`.

### Original Assessment

The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because:
1. The approach does not guarantee that `p` will be a valid permutation.
2. The program can produce invalid values (e.g., `-1`).
3. The constructed `p` may not form a valid permutation.

### Detailed Reasoning

Let's verify the logic of the program:

1. **Initialization**: `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the upper bound of the possible values in `p`.
2. **Reverse Iteration**: The program iterates from the end of `a` to the beginning. This means it tries to deduce the last element of `p` first, then the second last, and so on.
3. **Calculation of `p[i]`**: For each `i`, `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`. This ensures that `p[i]` is the smallest possible value that keeps the MEX condition valid.
4. **Updating `mex`**: After calculating `p[i]`, `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This helps in maintaining the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Program Output:**
The program will produce `4 2 0 1 -1`.

Let's manually check if this output is correct:
- For `i = 4`, `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`.
- For `i = 3`, `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
- For `i = 2`, `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`.
- For `i = 1`, `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`.
- For `i = 0`, `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.

Thus, `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is incorrect. The program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The reverse iteration and the way `mex` is updated ensure that `p` contains unique values from `0` to `n-1`.

**Final: True**
