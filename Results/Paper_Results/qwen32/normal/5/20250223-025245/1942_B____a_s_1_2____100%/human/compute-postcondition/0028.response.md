The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the range parameters. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` with a step of `-1`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `p` is a list of integers where `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements remain `-1`.
- `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.
- `i` is decremented by 1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` needs to be adjusted by incrementing it by 1 (since it was decremented at the end of the previous iteration).
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `t`, `a`, `p`, and `mex` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains the same.
- `t`, `a`, `p`, and `mex` remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements remain `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1**
