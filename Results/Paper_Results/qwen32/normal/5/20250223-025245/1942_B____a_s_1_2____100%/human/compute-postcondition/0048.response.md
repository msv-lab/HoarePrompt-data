To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step-by-step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` remains the same (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
2. `n` remains the same (the length of the list `a`).
3. `a` remains the same (a list of integers).
4. `p` will be updated such that `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
5. `mex` is the minimum value of `n` and all `p[i]` values after the loop finishes. However, `mex` is initially the smallest non-negative integer not in `a`.

### Process:
1. **Calculate `mex`**: `mex` starts as the smallest non-negative integer not in the list `a`.
2. **Update `p`**: For each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`.
3. **Recalculate `mex`**: After updating `p`, `mex` is recalculated as the smallest non-negative integer not in the updated list `p`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` after the updates.

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Determine Initial `mex`**: `mex` is initially the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the list `a`.
2. **Update `p`**: Each element of `p` is set to `mex - a[i]`. This means:
   - If `a[i]` is less than `mex`, `p[i]` will be a positive integer.
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `mex`, `p[i]` will be `0`.
   - If `a[i]` is greater than `mex`, `p[i]` will be negative (though this scenario is not typical as `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `a`).

3. **Recalculate `mex`**: After updating `p`, `mex` is recalculated as the smallest non-negative integer not in the updated list `p`. However, this recalculated `mex` is not used in the final print statement.

### Example:
Let's assume `a = [0, 1, 3]` and `n = 3`.

1. **Initial `mex`**: The smallest non-negative integer not in `a` is `2`.
2. **Update `p`**:
   - `p[0] = 2 - 0 = 2`
   - `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`
   - `p[2] = 2 - 3 = -1`
   So, `p = [2, 1, -1]`.

3. **Recalculate `mex`**: The smallest non-negative integer not in `p` is `0` (since `0` is not in `[2, 1, -1]`).

### Final Output:
The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` after the updates.

Output: **2 1 -1** (where `p` is the list updated as described above)
