The given code snippet updates the value of `mex` by taking the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. Here's the output state after the code execution:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements remain `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `mex` is updated to be the smaller of its current value and the value of `p[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
