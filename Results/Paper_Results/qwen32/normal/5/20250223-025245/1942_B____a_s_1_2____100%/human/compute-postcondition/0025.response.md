The loop head in this case is `i` and the range it iterates over, which is `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `i` starts at `n - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `p` is a list of integers where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements remain `-1`
- `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has just finished its current value and is about to decrement. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` according to the loop's decrement logic.

Let's assume the loop has just completed an iteration where `i` was some value `x`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x - 1`.

Given the loop runs from `n - 1` down to `0`, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` needs to be decremented by 1.

Thus, if at the end of the last iteration, `i` was `x`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements remain `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`; `i` is `i - 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can express the state in terms of the decrement:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]` and all other elements remain `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`; `i` is decremented by 1**.
