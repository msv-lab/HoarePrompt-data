The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be `n - 3` at the start of the next iteration.

The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted because it defines the range of the loop and does not change during the loop iterations.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element is updated to `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`; `i` is `n - 3`**
