Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers with all elements initialized to -1; `mex` is the input integer `n`.**

In this output state, the only change is that `mex` is now assigned the value of `n`, while all other variables retain their initial states.
