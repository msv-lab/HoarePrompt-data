The code snippet `mex = min(mex, p[i])` updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the `i`-th element of the list `p`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `p` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`.
- `mex` is equal to `n`.

The variable `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (`n`) and `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is defined as `mex - a[i]` for the `i`-th element, `p[i]` will be `n - a[i]`.

Therefore, the new value of `mex` will be the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `n - a[i]`.**
