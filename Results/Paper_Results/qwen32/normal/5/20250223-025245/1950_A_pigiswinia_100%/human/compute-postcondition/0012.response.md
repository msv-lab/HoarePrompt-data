The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided by the input and do not change in the loop head. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`, and either `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, or it is not the case that `a < b > c`.**
