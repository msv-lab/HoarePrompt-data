Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`, and either `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, or it is not the case that `a < b > c`.**
