The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since the initial state mentions that `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, the execution of the code will update these variables with the new input values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input.**

Natural language: The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input, while `t` remains greater than 0 and `i` remains 1. The relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` (whether `a < b < c` or not) is determined by the new input values.
