The provided initial state and the code snippet indicate the following:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, with the condition that `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:
```python
print('STAIR')
```

This `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Instead, it prints the string `'STAIR'` directly.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'STAIR'`.

Output: **STAIR**
