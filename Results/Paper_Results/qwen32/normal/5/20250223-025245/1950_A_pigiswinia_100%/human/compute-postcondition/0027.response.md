The function `func` accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, the function receives three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, each with the constraint that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9. The function then processes these inputs and returns a value based on the test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9 inclusive). It processes these inputs and returns a value for each test case.**
