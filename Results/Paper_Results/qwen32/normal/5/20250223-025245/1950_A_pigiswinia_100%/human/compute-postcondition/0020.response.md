The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` is provided, but the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated by the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input.**

In simpler terms: The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the input.
