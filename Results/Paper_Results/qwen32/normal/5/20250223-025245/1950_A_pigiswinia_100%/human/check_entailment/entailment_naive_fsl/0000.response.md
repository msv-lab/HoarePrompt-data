Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether the given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if true.
- It checks if `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if true.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The program handles all the provided examples correctly, and there are no edge cases that it fails to address given the constraints (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9). Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
