The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'PEAK'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('PEAK')`.
2. The string `'PEAK'` is a literal and does not depend on any variables.
3. The variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not influence the output.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
