Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input between 1 and 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if a < b < c:
        print('STAIR')
    elif a < b > c:
        print('PEAK')
    else:
        print('NONE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`, and either `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, or it is not the case that `a < b > c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input. If `a < b < c`, the condition is true and no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Otherwise, the condition `b > a` and `b > c` is evaluated, but `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged regardless of the evaluation result.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input. If `a < b < c`, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` also remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
