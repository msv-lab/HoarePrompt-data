Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to determine if three given digits form a "stair," a "peak," or neither.
2. A "stair" is defined by the condition a < b < c.
3. A "peak" is defined by the condition a < b > c.
4. If neither of the above conditions is met, the output should be "NONE".
5. The program reads the number of test cases, t, and then processes each test case individually.
6. For each test case, it reads three integers (a, b, c) and checks:
   - If a < b < c, it prints "STAIR".
   - If a < b > c, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
7. The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program accurately solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
