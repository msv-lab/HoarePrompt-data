The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 since `i` will iterate from 0 to `t-1`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
