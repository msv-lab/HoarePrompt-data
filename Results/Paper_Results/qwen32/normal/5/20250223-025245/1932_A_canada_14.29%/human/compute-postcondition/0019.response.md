For the given task, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which is the variable `i` in this case. The loop iterates over each character in the list `s`.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `len` is equal to `t`
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character
- If the current character `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0
- If the current character `i` is not '@', then `ret` remains 0
- If `i` is equal to `'*'`, `thorn` is set to 1 unless `thorn` was already 2, in which case the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of
- If `i` is not equal to `'*'`, then `thorn` remains 0

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in s:
    # the loop body is omit
```

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variable `i` to the next character in the list `s`.

Let's assume that the current character `i` is the `k`-th character in the list `s`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the `(k+1)`-th character in the list `s`.

Since we do not have the specific value of `k`, we can only describe the state in a general form. We know that `i` is the next character in the list `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`. The values of `ret` and `thorn` depend on the value of the new `i`.**
