Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 0, and the current character `i` is '@'.**

In this output state, the only change is that the value of `ret` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
