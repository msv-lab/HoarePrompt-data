The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations. The number of iterations is determined by the value provided by `int(input())`. The variables `ret` and `thorn` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be directly adjusted based on the loop syntax alone.

Given that the loop iterates a number of times specified by the user input, the state at the start of the next iteration does not need to change `ret` or `thorn`. These variables will be updated within the loop body, which is not provided.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration only needs to reflect the decrement in the number of iterations left, but since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't actually modify it. The loop will simply start its next iteration as long as the number of iterations specified by `int(input())` is not yet exhausted.

State: **`ret` is the count of `'@'` characters in `s` up to the point of breaking or end of list, and `thorn` is 0 if no two consecutive `'*'` characters are found, otherwise `thorn` is 2.**
