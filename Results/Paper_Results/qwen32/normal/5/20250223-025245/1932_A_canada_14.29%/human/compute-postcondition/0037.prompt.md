Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn == 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character. If the current character `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If the current character `i` is not '@', then `ret` remains 0. If `i` is equal to `'*'`, `thorn` is set to 1 unless `thorn` was already 2, in which case the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` is not equal to `'*'`, then `thorn` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is incremented by 1 and `thorn` is set to 0. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1, making it 3 if it was 2 before the increment, otherwise it remains 2. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `ret` and `thorn` depend on the value of the new `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, and `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the current `i`. If `i` was equal to '@', `ret` is incremented by 1 and `thorn` is set to 0. If `i` was not equal to '@', and `i` is equal to '*', then `thorn` is incremented by 1, and if `thorn` was equal to 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `thorn` is increased by 1. If `i` is not equal to '*', the comparison `thorn == 0` does not affect the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
