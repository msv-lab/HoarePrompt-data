The provided code snippet is `thorn == 0`, which is a comparison statement and does not actually change the value of `thorn`. It simply checks if `thorn` is equal to 0. Since `thorn` was initially 0, this comparison will evaluate to `True`, but it does not modify `thorn` or any other variables. 

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state for all variables except for the fact that the comparison result is `True`.

Output State: **`ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, the current character `i` is not equal to '@', and `i` is not equal to '*'**.
