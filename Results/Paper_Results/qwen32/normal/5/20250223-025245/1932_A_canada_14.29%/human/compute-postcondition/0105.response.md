Postcondition: **`ret` is 2 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` remains 0. `thorn` is 0 if `i` is '@', `thorn` is 3 if `i` is '*' and the original `thorn` was 2, `thorn` is 2 if `i` is '*' and the original `thorn` was not 2, otherwise `thorn` remains 0. `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `thorn` was 2 and `i` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
