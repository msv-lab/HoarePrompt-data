The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only terminates the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Therefore, the values of `ret`, `thorn`, `len`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, the current character `i` is equal to '*'.**
