Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, and the current character `i` is not equal to '@'. If `i` is equal to `'*'`, then `thorn` is 1 unless `thorn` was already 2, in which case the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` is not equal to `'*'`, then `thorn` remains 0.**
