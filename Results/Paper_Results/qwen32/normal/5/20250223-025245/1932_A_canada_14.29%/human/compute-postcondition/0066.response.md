Postcondition: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `len` is an input integer, `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. `thorn` is 0 unless the current character `i` is equal to `*`, in which case `thorn` is increased by 1, and if `thorn` reaches 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**
