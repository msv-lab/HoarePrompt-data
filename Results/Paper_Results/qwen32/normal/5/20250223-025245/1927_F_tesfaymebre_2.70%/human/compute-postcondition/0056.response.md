Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w_next_next, u_next_next, v_next_next)`; `u` is `u_next_next`; `v` is `v_next_next`; `w` is `w_next_next`; `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)` after the union operation; `parent_v` is `parent_u`; `_min_edge` is the minimum of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` and `w`. If `_min_edge` was updated to `w`, then `node_u` is set to `u` and `node_v` is set to `v`. If `_min_edge` was not updated, `node_u` and `node_v` retain their previous values.**
