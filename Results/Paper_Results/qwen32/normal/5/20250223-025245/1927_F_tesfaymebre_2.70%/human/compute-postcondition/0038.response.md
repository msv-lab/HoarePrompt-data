Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\). `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory. `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w, u, v)`. `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes. `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration of the loop. `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class initialized with `n + 1` elements and reflects the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`. If `parent_u` was equal to `parent_v` before the union, and `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, then `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` and `node_u` is set to `u` and `node_v` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `_min_edge` remains `float('inf')` and `node_u` and `node_v` remain `-1`. If `parent_u` was not equal to `parent_v` before the union, then `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` will return the same value after the union, and `_min_edge` remains `float('inf')` and `node_u` and `node_v` remain `-1`.**
