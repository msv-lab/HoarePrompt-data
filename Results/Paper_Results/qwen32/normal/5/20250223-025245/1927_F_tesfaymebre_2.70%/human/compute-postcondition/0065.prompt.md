You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, m is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph, such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5).
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and contains all the edges added during the loop; `edges` is a list containing all the tuples `(w, u, v)` added during the loop; `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes, indicating all iterations have finished; `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration of the loop.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and contains all the edges added during the loop; `edges` is a list containing all the tuples `(w, u, v)` added during the loop, sorted in descending order by `w`; `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes; `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration of the loop; `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class initialized with `n + 1` elements and reflects all the unions performed during the loop; `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight in the final connected component; `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes of the edge with `_min_edge` weight in the final connected component.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum edge weight in the final connected component, and len(res) is the number of nodes in the connected component that includes node_u)
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: res (where res is the result of the DFS traversal starting from node_u in the graph)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in a graph and `m` is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph. The function returns a graph based on the provided number of vertices and edges, ensuring that `3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
