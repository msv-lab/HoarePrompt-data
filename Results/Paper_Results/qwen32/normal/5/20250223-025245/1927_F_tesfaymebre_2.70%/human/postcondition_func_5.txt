The function constructs a graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, sorts the edges by weight in descending order, and uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find a connected component. It identifies the minimum edge weight in this component and performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes of this minimum edge. The function prints the minimum edge weight, the number of nodes in the connected component, and the nodes themselves.
