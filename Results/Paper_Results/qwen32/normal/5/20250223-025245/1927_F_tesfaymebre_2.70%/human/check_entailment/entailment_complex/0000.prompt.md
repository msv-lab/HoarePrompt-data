Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

    #This is printed: res (where res is the result of the DFS traversal starting from node_u in the graph)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function constructs a graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, sorts the edges by weight in descending order, and uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find a connected component. It identifies the minimum edge weight in this component and performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes of this minimum edge. The function prints the minimum edge weight, the number of nodes in the connected component, and the nodes themselves.

#Function 7:

The color of the current vertex `curr` is 1. No result containing `node_v` was found in any of the recursive calls, so the function does not return anything.
    colors[curr] = 2
    return []
    #The program returns an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal starting from a given vertex `curr`. It keeps track of the traversal path and uses a color array to mark visited vertices. If it detects a cycle containing a specific node `node_v`, it returns the path of that cycle. If no such cycle is found, it returns an empty list.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= test_cases <= 10^4.

    #State: `test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()` and remains unchanged after all iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the number of test cases by calling `func_1()`, then iterates that many times, calling `func_6()` in each iteration. The function does not return any specific value and the final state is determined by the side effects of `func_6()`.
