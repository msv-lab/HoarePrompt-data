The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()` minus 1, and it must be between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\). For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must be greater than 0 after the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `test_cases` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()` minus 2, and must be between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\)**
