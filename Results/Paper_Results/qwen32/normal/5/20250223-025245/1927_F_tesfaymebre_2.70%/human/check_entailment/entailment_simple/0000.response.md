### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph such that the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimal. The program uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find cycles and a Depth-First Search (DFS) to extract the cycle once a cycle is detected. Here is a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and its correctness:

1. **DSU Initialization and Operations**:
   - The `DSU` class is used to manage connected components in the graph.
   - The `find` method is used to find the root of a vertex, with path compression to speed up future queries.
   - The `union` method is used to merge two components, updating the minimum edge weight in the process.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`.
   - It then reads the edges and stores them in a list `edges` and a graph adjacency list `graph`.

3. **Sorting and Processing Edges**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights.
   - The program iterates over the edges, adding them to the DSU structure.
   - When an edge is added that connects two vertices already in the same component, a cycle is detected.
   - The program keeps track of the minimum edge weight in the detected cycle.

4. **Finding the Cycle**:
   - Once a cycle is detected, the program uses DFS starting from one of the vertices of the detected cycle (`node_u`) to find the full cycle.
   - The DFS function `dfs` is used to traverse the graph and identify the cycle.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues:
- **Sorting in Descending Order**: The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. This means that the smallest edge weight in a cycle will be the last one to be processed, which is not optimal for finding the cycle with the smallest edge weight.
- **Cycle Detection**: The current logic for cycle detection and extraction is flawed. The program does not correctly identify the cycle with the smallest edge weight due to the incorrect sorting order and the way the cycle is extracted.
- **DFS Function**: The DFS function is supposed to return a cycle once it detects the cycle, but it does not correctly handle the case where the cycle is not found in the first traversal.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly find the cycle with the smallest edge weight. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
