### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to find a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph such that the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimal. Here's a detailed analysis of the program to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of vertices) and `m` (number of edges) using `func_3()`.
   - It then reads the edges, each consisting of two vertices `u` and `v` and a weight `w`, also using `func_3()`.
   - The edges are stored in a list `edges` and a graph adjacency list `graph`.

2. **Sorting and Union-Find**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights.
   - The program uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to manage connected components and find cycles.
   - As it processes each edge, it checks if the vertices `u` and `v` are in the same connected component using `dsu.find()`.
   - If they are in the same component, a cycle is detected, and the program updates the minimum edge weight in the cycle using `dsu.min_edge`.

3. **Cycle Detection**:
   - When a cycle is detected, the program records the edge with the minimum weight `_min_edge` and the vertices `node_u` and `node_v` of this edge.
   - The program then performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from `node_u` to find the exact cycle that includes `node_v`.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The DFS function `dfs()` traverses the graph to find a cycle that contains `node_v`.
   - It uses a `colors` array to keep track of visited nodes.
   - If a cycle is found (i.e., a node is revisited), the function returns the path of the cycle.
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight, the number of vertices in the cycle, and the vertices themselves.

5. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program outputs the minimum edge weight in the cycle and the vertices of the cycle in the required format.

### Correctness:

- The program correctly implements the logic to find a cycle with the minimum weight edge using the union-find data structure and DFS.
- It handles multiple test cases and processes each test case independently.
- The DFS ensures that the cycle detected is simple and contains the minimum weight edge.
- The program adheres to the problem constraints and requirements.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct in its approach and implementation.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
