The only variable in the loop head is `nei`, which is the neighbor of the current vertex `curr` in the graph. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `nei` to the next neighbor in `graph[curr]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex.
- `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex.
- `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal including `curr`.
- The color of the current vertex `curr` is 1.
- `graph[curr]` must contain at least one more neighbor.
- `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in `graph[curr]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `nei` was the last neighbor processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `nei` must be updated to the next neighbor in `graph[curr]`.

State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal including `curr`, and the color of the current vertex `curr` is 1. `graph[curr]` must contain at least one more neighbor, `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in `graph[curr]` after the previously processed neighbor.**
