The function `dfs` performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal starting from a given vertex `curr`. It keeps track of the traversal path and uses a color array to mark visited vertices. If it detects a cycle containing a specific node `node_v`, it returns the path of that cycle. If no such cycle is found, it returns an empty list.
