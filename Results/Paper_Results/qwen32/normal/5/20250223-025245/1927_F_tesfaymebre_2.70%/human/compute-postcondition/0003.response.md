The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop iterates `test_cases` times. Since the underscore `_` does not affect the loop's continuation, the only variable we need to consider is `test_cases` itself.

At the end of the previous iteration, `test_cases` was the value returned by `func_1()` and must be between 1 and 10^4. After each iteration, the loop implicitly decrements the counter (though this is handled internally by the `range` function, not explicitly in the code). For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0 after the previous iteration.

Since the loop has just completed an iteration, `test_cases` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the number of remaining iterations.

State: **`test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()` minus 1, and must be between 0 and 10^4 - 1**.
