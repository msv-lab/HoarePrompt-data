Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\). `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory. `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w, u, v)`. `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes. `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration of the loop. `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class initialized with `n + 1` elements, and the union operation has been performed on `u` and `v` with weight `w`, potentially changing the parent of one of them. `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`. `node_u` is `-1`. `node_v` is `-1`. `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)` before the union operation. `parent_v` is the result of `dsu.find(v)` before the union operation. Additionally, `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v` before the union operation, indicating that `u` and `v` were in the same connected component of the graph, but after the union operation, this may no longer be the case as the union operation could have merged different components.**

In simpler terms, after the union operation, `u` and `v` are now part of the same connected component in the DSU structure, and the parent of one of them may have changed. All other variables remain unchanged.
