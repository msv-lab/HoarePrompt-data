To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the provided output states after the first few iterations.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(test_cases):
    func_6()
```

- **Initial State**: `test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()`, where 1 <= `test_cases` <= 10^4.
- **Loop Body**: The loop body consists of a single function call `func_6()`, which does not modify `test_cases` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

From the provided information:
- After the first iteration, `test_cases` is unchanged (still the value returned by `func_1()`).
- After the second iteration, `test_cases` is effectively `test_cases - 1`.
- After the third iteration, `test_cases` is effectively `test_cases - 2`.

This indicates that the loop variable `_` in `range(test_cases)` is decrementing `test_cases` implicitly by iterating through its range. Therefore, after all iterations, `test_cases` would have been decremented by the number of times the loop ran, which is the initial value of `test_cases` itself.

Thus, after all iterations, `test_cases` would be 0.

**Output State**: **`test_cases` is 0.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` will be 0, as the loop runs `test_cases` number of times, decrementing the count to zero.
