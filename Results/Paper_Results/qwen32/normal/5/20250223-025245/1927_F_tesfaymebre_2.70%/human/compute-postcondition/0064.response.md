Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in a graph and `m` is an integer representing the number of edges in the graph. The function returns a graph based on the provided number of vertices and edges, ensuring that `3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5).**
