To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the initial state and how the loop affects the variable `test_cases`.

### Initial State:
- `test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()`, which is between 1 and 10^4.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `test_cases` times.
- During each iteration, `func_6()` is called, but it does not modify `test_cases` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.
- After each iteration, the loop counter decreases by 1 until it reaches 0.

### Output State after All Iterations:
- Since `func_6()` does not modify `test_cases`, its value remains the same throughout the loop.
- The loop will execute exactly `test_cases` times, and after all iterations, the loop counter will be 0.
- `test_cases` will still hold the value returned by `func_1()` because it is not modified in the loop.

### Final Output State:
- `test_cases` retains its initial value, which is the value returned by `func_1()`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()` and remains unchanged after all iterations of the loop.**
