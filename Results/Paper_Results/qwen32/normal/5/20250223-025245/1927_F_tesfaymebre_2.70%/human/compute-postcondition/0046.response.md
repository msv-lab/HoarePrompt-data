Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w_next, u_next, v_next)`; `u` is `u_next`; `v` is `v_next`; `w` is `w_next`; `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)` before the union operation; `parent_v` is the result of `dsu.find(v)` before the union operation; the union operation has been performed on `u` and `v` with weight `w` in the `dsu` structure; `_min_edge` is `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`. If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, then `node_u` is set to `u` and `node_v` is set to `v`.**
