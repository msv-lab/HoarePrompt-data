Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph such that the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimal. The graph is guaranteed to have at least one cycle.

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Cycle Detection**: The program should be able to detect a cycle in the graph.
2. **Minimum Weight Edge in Cycle**: The detected cycle should have the lightest edge with the minimal weight.
3. **Traversal Order**: The vertices of the cycle should be printed in traversal order.

#### Code Review:
- **DSU (Disjoint Set Union) Implementation**: The code uses DSU to detect cycles. It keeps track of the minimum edge weight in each connected component.
- **Cycle Detection**: The program attempts to detect cycles by checking if two vertices are in the same connected component.
- **Cycle Construction**: Once a cycle is detected, it uses DFS to construct the cycle starting from one of the vertices involved in the cycle.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Sorting Edges in Reverse Order**: The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. This may not be optimal for finding the cycle with the minimum weight edge.
2. **Cycle Construction**: The DFS function is supposed to construct the cycle once a cycle is detected, but it might not correctly handle all cases.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program should handle graphs with multiple cycles and ensure that the cycle with the minimum weight edge is found.

### Testing the Program

Let's consider a test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4 5
1 2 10
2 3 8
3 1 5
4 5 100
5 6 40
6 4 3
4 2 5
3 4 7
2 4 1
1 4 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 4
1 4 2 3
```

**Explanation:**
- The cycle `1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1` has the minimum weight edge `1 -> 4` with weight `3`.

However, the provided code has issues:
- The DSU implementation does not correctly maintain the minimum edge weight for the entire cycle.
- The DFS function might not correctly identify the cycle starting from the correct vertex.

### Conclusion

Given the potential issues identified, the program is likely to fail in some cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the detection and construction of the cycle with the minimum weight edge in all cases. The sorting of edges in reverse order and the way the DSU and DFS functions are implemented might lead to incorrect results.
