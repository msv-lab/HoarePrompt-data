Let's carefully analyze the program and the provided function summary to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads a balanced parentheses sequence `n` from the input.
   - It then calls `func_1(n)` to compute the balanced shuffle.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a dictionary `d` with `d[0] = 0` to represent the balance before the first character.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates the balance for each position `i + 1`:
     - If `s[i] == '('`, the balance is incremented by 1.
     - If `s[i] == ')'`, the balance is decremented by 1.
   - This results in a dictionary `d` where the keys are positions (1-based) and the values are the corresponding prefix balances.

3. **Removing Unnecessary Entry**:
   - The last entry `d.pop(n)` is removed, which is the balance after the last character. This step is unnecessary because the balance after the last character is not used in the sorting or output.

4. **Sorting**:
   - The dictionary `d` is converted to a list of tuples and sorted based on the balance (`x[1]`) in increasing order. In case of ties (same balance), it sorts by the position (`-x[0]`) in decreasing order.
   - This sorting ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

5. **Reconstructing the Shuffled Sequence**:
   - An empty string `ans` is initialized.
   - The function iterates through the sorted list of tuples and appends the character `s[i]` to `ans` for each tuple `(i, j)`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function returns the shuffled sequence `ans`.

### Correctness Check:

- **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The prefix balance calculation is correct. For each character in the string, the balance is correctly updated.
- **Sorting**: The sorting step is correctly implemented according to the problem description. Characters are sorted by their prefix balance in increasing order, and ties are broken by the position in decreasing order.
- **Reconstruction**: The reconstruction of the shuffled sequence from the sorted list of tuples is correct. The characters are appended to `ans` in the correct order.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
