Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with the key `0` and value `0`.**

In simple terms, the string `s` remains a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` still holds the length of `s`, `ans` is still an empty string, and `d` now contains one key-value pair where the key is `0` and the value is `0`.
