### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the input string `s`.
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized to keep track of the prefix balance at each position. The key is the position (1-indexed) and the value is the prefix balance.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - For each character, it updates the prefix balance:
     - If the character is '(', it increments the balance by 1.
     - If the character is ')', it decrements the balance by 1.
   - This balance is stored in the dictionary `d` with the position as the key.

3. **Dictionary Manipulation**:
   - After the loop, the dictionary `d` contains the prefix balance for each position.
   - The last entry in `d` (which corresponds to the overall balance of the string) is removed since it is not needed for the shuffle operation.

4. **Sorting**:
   - The dictionary items are sorted based on the prefix balance in increasing order. If two items have the same prefix balance, they are sorted by their position in decreasing order.
   - This sorting ensures that the characters are rearranged such that the resulting sequence has the same balance properties as described in the problem statement.

5. **Reconstructing the Result**:
   - The characters from the input string `s` are appended to the result string `ans` in the order determined by the sorted dictionary.
   - This results in the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

### Verification:
The execution summary indicates that the function `func_1` rearranges the characters of the input string based on their depth in the nested structure of parentheses, which aligns with the balanced shuffle operation. The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the program, producing the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
