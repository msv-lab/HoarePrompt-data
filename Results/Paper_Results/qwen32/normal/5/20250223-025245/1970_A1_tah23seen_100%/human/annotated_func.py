#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.

    #State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n, and the value for key `n` is `0`.

    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: ans is a string formed by concatenating the characters from `s` at the indices specified by the tuples in `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` which is formed by concatenating the characters from `s` at the indices specified by the tuples in `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and returns a new string formed by rearranging the characters of `s` based on their depth in the nested structure of parentheses.
