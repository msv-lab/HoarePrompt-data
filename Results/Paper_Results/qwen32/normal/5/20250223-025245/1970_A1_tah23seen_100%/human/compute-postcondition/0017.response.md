Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary. If the character at position `1` in `s` is `(`, then `d` is `{0: 0, 1: 1, 3: 3}` if `s[i]` is `(`, otherwise `d` is `{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 0}`. If the character at position `1` in `s` is `)`, then `d` is `{0: 0, 1: -1, 3: 1}` if `s[i]` is `(`, otherwise `d` is `{0: 0, 1: -1, 2: -2}`; `i` is `2`.**
