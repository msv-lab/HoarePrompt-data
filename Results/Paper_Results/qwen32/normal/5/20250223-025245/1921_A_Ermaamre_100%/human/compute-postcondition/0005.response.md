To determine what will be printed by the `print(dx * dx)` statement, we need to understand the values and relationships of the variables `x` and `dx` based on the given initial state.

1. **Variable `t`**: This is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). The value of `t` does not directly influence the calculation of `dx` or the final output, so we can disregard it for this specific task.

2. **Variable `a`**: This is a 2D list containing 4 lists of integers. Each inner list corresponds to the integers from one line of input. For example, `a` could look like this:
   ```python
   a = [
       [1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6],
       [7, 8, 9],
       [10, 11, 12]
   ]
   ```

3. **Variable `x`**: This is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in `a`. Using the example above for `a`, `x` would be:
   ```python
   x = [1, 4, 7, 10]
   ```

4. **Variable `dx`**: This is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`. Continuing with the example for `x`:
   - The maximum value in `x` is 10.
   - The minimum value in `x` is 1.
   - Therefore, `dx` would be \(10 - 1 = 9\).

5. **The Print Statement**: The statement `print(dx * dx)` will print the square of `dx`. Given our example, `dx` is 9, so `dx * dx` would be \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

Based on the above reasoning, the output will be the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`, which is derived from the first elements of each inner list in the 2D list `a`.

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list x, and x is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in a)**

Given the example values, the precise output would be:
Output: **81**
