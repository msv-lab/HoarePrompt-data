To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the values of the variables involved in the `print` statement, specifically `dx * dx`.

1. **`t`**: This is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\). However, it is not used in the code snippet provided.

2. **`a`**: This is a new 2D list containing 4 lists of integers. The exact integers are not provided, but we know the structure is something like:
   ```python
   a = [
       [a11, a12, a13, ...],
       [a21, a22, a23, ...],
       [a31, a32, a33, ...],
       [a41, a42, a43, ...]
   ]
   ```

3. **`x`**: This is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in the new `a`. So, `x` would be:
   ```python
   x = [a11, a21, a31, a41]
   ```

4. **`dx`**: This is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`. Mathematically, it is:
   ```python
   dx = max(x) - min(x)
   ```

5. **`dx * dx`**: This is the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

Since the exact values of the integers in the lists are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `dx * dx`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list x)**
