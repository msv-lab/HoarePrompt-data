Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
    x = [p[0] for p in a]
    dx = max(x) - min(x)
    print(dx * dx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `a` is a 2D list containing 4 lists of integers, where each inner list corresponds to the integers from one line of input; `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `a` is a new 2D list containing 4 lists of integers from the input; `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in the new `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 99; `a` is a 2D list containing 4 lists of integers from the new input; `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in the initial `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
