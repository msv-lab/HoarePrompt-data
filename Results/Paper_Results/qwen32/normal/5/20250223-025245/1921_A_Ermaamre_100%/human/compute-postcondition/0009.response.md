Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `a` is a new 2D list containing 4 lists of integers from the input; `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in the new `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `dx` has been updated to be the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
