The value of `x` is updated to be the integer division of its current value by 2. Since `x` is even, the result of `x // 2` will still be an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `x` is an input integer divided by 2 (and the result is still an integer); `x` is not equal to 1; `x` is even; `max` is 99999999; `min` is -100000000; `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000.**
