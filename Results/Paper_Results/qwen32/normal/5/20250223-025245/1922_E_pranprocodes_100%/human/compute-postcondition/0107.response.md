The value of `x` is halved using integer division. Since `x` must be greater than 2, after the operation, `x` will still be greater than 1. The parity of `x` (whether it is even or odd) will affect the values of `max` and `min` as follows:

- If `x` (before modification) was even, then `x` (after modification) will be even if the original `x` was divisible by 4, or odd if the original `x` was not divisible by 4.
- If `x` (before modification) was odd, then `x` (after modification) will be odd.

Based on these conditions, we can update the values of `max` and `min`:

- If `x` (before modification) was even:
  - If `x` (after modification) is even, `max` remains 99999997 and `min` remains -99999998.
  - If `x` (after modification) is odd, `max` becomes 99999998 and `min` becomes -100000000.
  
- If `x` (before modification) was odd:
  - If `x` (after modification) is even, `max` becomes 99999999 and `min` becomes -99999998.
  - If `x` (after modification) is odd, `max` remains 99999998 and `min` remains -100000000.

Since the exact value of `x` before modification is not specified, we cannot definitively state the new values of `max` and `min`. However, we know the conditions under which they change.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is `x // 2` (where `x` must be greater than 1), `max` is 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999 based on the parity of `x` before and after modification, `min` is -99999999, -99999998, or -100000000 based on the parity of `x` before and after modification, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, 100000000] or [100000000, -99999999, 100000000] or [-100000000, 100000000, 100000000] or [-100000000, -100000000, 100000000] or [100000000, 99999999, 99999999] or [100000000, -99999999, 99999999] or [-100000000, 100000000, 99999999] or [-100000000, -100000000, 99999999], `i` is `i` + 1**
