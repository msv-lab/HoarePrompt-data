Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000] if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000], and `i` is `i` + 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables (`x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
