The code snippet `max -= 1` decrements the value of `max` by 1. Given the initial state, `max` is either 99999999 (if `x` is even) or 100000000 (if `x` is odd). After the decrement, `max` becomes 99999998 (if `x` is even) or 99999999 (if `x` is odd). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is not equal to 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, 100000000], and `i` is `i` + 1**.
