The value of `t` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `t` was 2, so the new value of `t` is 3. The values of `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`t` is 3; `x` is an input integer that has been modified based on its parity and is not equal to 1; `max` is 99999997 if `x % 2 == 0`, or 99999998 otherwise; `min` is -99999999 if `x % 2 == 0`, or -99999998 otherwise; and `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999, 99999998]` if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 == 0`, `[100000000, 99999999, -99999999]` if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 != 0`, `[-100000000, -99999999, 100000000]` if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 == 0`, or `[-100000000, -99999999, -99999998]` if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 != 0`.**
