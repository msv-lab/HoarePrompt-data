To determine the final output state after the loop has completed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1. Depending on whether `x` is even or odd, it either gets halved or decremented by 1, and the `max` or `min` value is appended to the `ans` list accordingly.

The loop will terminate when `x` becomes 1. At this point, `t` will represent the total number of iterations the loop has performed, `max` and `min` will have been adjusted based on the number of iterations and the parity of `x` during each iteration, and `ans` will contain the sequence of `max` and `min` values appended during each iteration.

Letâ€™s break down the final state:

1. **`t`**: This variable counts the number of iterations. The loop will run until `x` becomes 1. Thus, `t` will be the number of steps it takes to reduce `x` to 1.
2. **`x`**: This variable will be 1 when the loop terminates.
3. **`max`**: This variable starts at 100000000 and is decremented each time `x` is even.
4. **`min`**: This variable starts at -100000000 and is incremented each time `x` is odd.
5. **`ans`**: This list will contain the sequence of `max` and `min` values appended during each iteration.
6. **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1 after the loop, but its value is not affected by the loop's iterations directly. It is part of the precondition and remains unchanged during the loop's execution.

The exact values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` depend on the initial value of `x` and the sequence of even and odd values `x` takes during the iterations. However, we can describe the final state in a general format.

### Final Output State

- **`t`**: The total number of iterations it took to reduce `x` to 1.
- **`x`**: 1 (since the loop terminates when `x` becomes 1).
- **`max`**: The value of `max` after all the decrements (each time `x` was even).
- **`min`**: The value of `min` after all the increments (each time `x` was odd).
- **`ans`**: A list of `max` and `min` values appended during each iteration.
- **`i`**: `i` + 1 (since `i` is incremented by 1 after the loop completes).

### Example

Let's assume the initial value of `x` is 5. The loop will execute as follows:

1. `x` is 5 (odd), `ans` = [-100000000], `min` = -99999999, `max` = 100000000, `t` = 1.
2. `x` is 4 (even), `ans` = [-100000000, 100000000], `min` = -99999999, `max` = 99999999, `t` = 2.
3. `x` is 2 (even), `ans` = [-100000000, 100000000, 99999999], `min` = -99999999, `max` = 99999998, `t` = 3.
4. `x` is 1 (odd), `ans` = [-100000000, 100000000, 99999999, 99999998], `min` = -99999999, `max` = 99999998, `t` = 4.

Output State: **`t` is 4, `x` is 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [-100000000, 100000000, 99999999, 99999998], and `i` is `i` + 1.**

In natural language, the final output state will be that `x` is reduced to 1, `t` is the total number of iterations it took to reach 1, `max` and `min` are adjusted based on the number of even and odd values `x` took, `ans` contains the sequence of `max` and `min` values appended during each iteration, and `i` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the final output state in the required format is:

Output State: **`t` is the total number of iterations, `x` is 1, `max` and `min` are adjusted based on the sequence of even and odd values `x` took, `ans` is the list of `max` and `min` values appended during each iteration, and `i` is `i` + 1.**
