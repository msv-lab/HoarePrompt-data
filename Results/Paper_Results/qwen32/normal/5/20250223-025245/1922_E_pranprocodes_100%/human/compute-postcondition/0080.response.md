Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations needed to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is the initial min value plus the number of odd `x` values encountered, `ans` is a reversed list of `max` and `min` values corresponding to each iteration, and `i` is `i` + 1**
The value of `max` has been updated to 100000000, while the values of `t`, `x`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
