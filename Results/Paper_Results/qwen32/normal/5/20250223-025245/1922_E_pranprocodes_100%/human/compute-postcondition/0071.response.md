Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is any integer except 0 or 1, `max` is either 99999998, 99999999, or 100000000, `min` is either -99999998 or -99999997, `ans` is either [100000000, max, min], [-100000000, max, min], [100000000, min, min], or [-100000000, min, min], and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` was initially any integer except 1, after the decrement, `x` is now any integer except 0 or 1. The values of `t`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
