You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to construct an array of integers such that the number of strictly increasing subsequences in the array is exactly X. If no such array can be constructed, the program should output `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X`.

2. **Array Construction Logic:**
   - The program initializes `max` and `min` to large positive and negative values, respectively.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly divide `X` by 2 (if `X` is even) or decrement `X` by 1 (if `X` is odd).
   - Depending on whether `X` is even or odd, it appends either `max` or `min` to the `ans` list and adjusts `max` or `min` accordingly.
   - The process continues until `X` becomes 1.
   - The constructed array `ans` is then reversed and printed.

3. **Output:**
   - The length of the constructed array is printed.
   - The elements of the constructed array are printed.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Number of Increasing Subsequences:**
  - The program attempts to construct an array such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.
  - The logic used in the program is based on the idea that appending either a large or small number can create new increasing subsequences, but it does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly `X`.
  - The approach of repeatedly dividing `X` by 2 and decrementing it by 1 does not inherently ensure that the number of increasing subsequences in the constructed array will match `X`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle the case where `X` is very large (close to \(10^{18}\)). The constructed array might exceed the length constraint of 200.
  - The program does not handle cases where constructing an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences is impossible.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all values of `X`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
