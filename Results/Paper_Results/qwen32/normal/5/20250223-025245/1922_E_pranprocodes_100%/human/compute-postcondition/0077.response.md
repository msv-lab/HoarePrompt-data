Let's break down the given initial state and understand the implications for the `print(*ans)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`x` is 1**: This means the number `x` has already reached 1, so no iterations are needed to reduce it further.
2. **`t` is the number of iterations needed to reduce `x` to 1**: Since `x` is already 1, `t` must be 0.
3. **`max` is the initial max value minus the number of even `x` values encountered**: Since `x` is 1 (an odd number) and no iterations are needed, the number of even `x` values encountered is 0. Therefore, `max` remains the initial max value.
4. **`min` is the initial min value plus the number of odd `x` values encountered**: Since `x` is 1 (an odd number) and no iterations are needed, the number of odd `x` values encountered is 1. Therefore, `min` is the initial min value plus 1.
5. **`ans` is a reversed list of `max` and `min` values corresponding to each iteration**: Since `t` is 0, there are no iterations, and thus `ans` should be an empty list.

### Explanation of `print(*ans)`:
- The `*ans` syntax in the `print` statement unpacks the list `ans` and prints its elements separated by spaces.
- Since `ans` is an empty list, there are no elements to print.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print nothing, as `ans` is an empty list.

Output: **(nothing)**
