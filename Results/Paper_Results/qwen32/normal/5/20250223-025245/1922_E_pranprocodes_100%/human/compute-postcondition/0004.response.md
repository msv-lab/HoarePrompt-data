The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `ans`. The values of `t`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` is an input integer; `max` is 100000000; `min` is -100000000; `ans` is an empty list.**
