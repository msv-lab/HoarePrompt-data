The code increments the value of `min` by 1. Therefore, the value of `min` changes from -100000000 to -99999999. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` must not be 1 and `x` is an odd number, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [-100000000], and `i` is `i` + 1**.
