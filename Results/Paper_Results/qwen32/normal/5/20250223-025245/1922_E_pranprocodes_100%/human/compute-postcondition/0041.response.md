The code snippet provided only sets the value of `max` to `100000000`. None of the other variables (`t`, `x`, `min`, `ans`, `i`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the total number of iterations, `x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is incremented by the number of odd `x` encountered, `ans` is a list of values appended during each iteration in reverse order, `i` is `i + 1`**.
