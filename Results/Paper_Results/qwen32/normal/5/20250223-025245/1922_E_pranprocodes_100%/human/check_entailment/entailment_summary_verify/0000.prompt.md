You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max = 100000000
        min = -100000000
        ans = []
        t = 0
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        ans.reverse()
        print(t)
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each with an integer `X` (where 2 <= X <= 10^18). For each test case, it performs a series of operations to reduce `X` to 1, appending either a decreasing maximum value or an increasing minimum value to a list based on whether `X` is even or odd, respectively. It then prints the number of operations performed and the list of appended values in reverse order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with exactly X increasing subsequences for all possible values of X within the given constraints. The logic used in the program is flawed and does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly X.

Let's analyze the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the integer X.
2. It initializes `max` and `min` to large positive and negative values, respectively.
3. It then enters a loop where it repeatedly divides X by 2 if X is even and decrements X by 1 if X is odd, appending `max` or `min` to the `ans` list accordingly.
4. After the loop, it reverses the `ans` list and prints its length and elements.

However, this approach does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences in the generated array is exactly X. The problem requires constructing an array such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X, which is a more complex task.

For example, consider the input `X = 5`. The correct output could be an array like `[0, 1, 0]`, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 1, 0]`.

The provided program does not handle such cases correctly. It does not guarantee that the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly X for all values of X. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To correctly solve this problem, a different approach is needed, such as using a mathematical method to construct the array based on the properties of increasing subsequences.
