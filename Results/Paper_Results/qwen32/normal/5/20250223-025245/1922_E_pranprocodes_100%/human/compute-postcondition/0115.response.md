To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the role of the variable `t`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is described as the total number of iterations.
- `x` is initialized to 1.
- `max` and `min` are adjusted based on the sequence of even and odd values that `x` takes.
- `ans` is a list that stores `max` and `min` values appended during each iteration, but in reverse order.
- `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration (though `i` is not directly relevant to the `print(t)` statement).

### Analysis:
The variable `t` is explicitly defined as the total number of iterations. However, the initial state does not provide the exact value of `t`. Since the problem statement does not specify a specific number of iterations, we can only describe `t` in terms of what it represents.

### Conclusion:
The `print(t)` statement will output the total number of iterations, which is `t`.

Output: **t (where t is the total number of iterations)**
