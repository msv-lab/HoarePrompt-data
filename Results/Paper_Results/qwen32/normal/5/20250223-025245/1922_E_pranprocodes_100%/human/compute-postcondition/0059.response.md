Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is any integer except 1 divided by 2, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either [100000000, max] or [-100000000, max], and `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `x` is now half of its previous value (integer division), while all other variables remain unchanged.
