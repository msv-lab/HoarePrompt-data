Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is any integer except 1, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is either [100000000, min] or [-100000000, min], and `i` is `i + 1`**

Natural language: The value of `min` has been incremented by 1, so if `min` was initially -100000000, it is now -99999999, and if `min` was initially -99999999, it is now -99999998. All other variables remain unchanged.
