The code snippet `ans = []` reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list, discarding any previous values it might have held. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the total number of iterations, `x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is `i + 1`.**
