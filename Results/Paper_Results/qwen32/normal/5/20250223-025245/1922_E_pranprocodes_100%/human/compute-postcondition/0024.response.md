Postcondition: **`t` is 1; `x` is an input integer that has been modified based on its parity and is not equal to 1. If the original `x` was even, `x` is now `x / 2`, `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even and 99999999 if `x` was odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` was even and -100000000 if `x` was odd, and `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` was even and [100000000, -100000000] if `x` was odd. If the original `x` was odd, `x` is now `x - 1`, `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even and 100000000 if `x` was odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` was even and -99999998 if `x` was odd, and `ans` is [-100000000, 100000000] if `x` was even and [-100000000, -99999999] if `x` was odd.**
