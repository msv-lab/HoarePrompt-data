The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `max_val`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. The function is supposed to return `x`, but since the return statement is not present in the provided code, the function does not return anything in this snippet. However, based on the initial state, we know that the function will return `x` when the return statement is executed.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000; `max_val` is 1**.
