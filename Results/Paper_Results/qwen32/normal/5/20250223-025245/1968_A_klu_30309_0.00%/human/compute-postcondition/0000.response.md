Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000. The function returns `x`.**

Explanation: The function aims to find the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`. Given the constraints and the nature of the greatest common divisor (gcd), the maximum value of `gcd(x, y) + y` is achieved when `y` equals `x`. This is because `gcd(x, x)` is `x`, making `gcd(x, x) + x` equal to `2x`, which is the highest possible value for `gcd(x, y) + y` given the constraints. Therefore, the function returns `x`.
