You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find an integer `y` (1 ≤ y < x) that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y`. Here, `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.

### Observations:
1. **Maximizing gcd(x, y) + y**: 
    - If `y` is a divisor of `x`, then `gcd(x, y) = y`.
    - Therefore, `gcd(x, y) + y = 2 * y` if `y` divides `x`.
    - If `y` does not divide `x`, then `gcd(x, y) < y`, so `gcd(x, y) + y < 2 * y`.

2. **Finding the Optimal y**:
    - If there is a divisor `y` of `x` such that `2 * y >= x`, then `y` is the optimal solution because `2 * y` will be maximized.
    - If no such `y` exists, we need to find the largest possible `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates from `x-1` down to `2` to find the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`.

1. **Iterating from x-1 to 2**:
    - This ensures that we are checking the largest possible `y` first.
    - If `y` is a divisor of `x` and `2 * y >= x`, the function returns `y` immediately, which is optimal.
    - If no such `y` is found, it keeps track of the largest `y` that divides `x` in `max_val`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
    - If `x` is prime, the largest `y` that divides `x` is `1`, and `gcd(x, 1) + 1 = 2`.
    - For composite `x`, the program correctly finds the optimal `y` by checking divisors.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`. It efficiently finds the optimal `y` by checking divisors of `x` in descending order and returns the first `y` that satisfies `2 * y >= x` if it exists, otherwise it returns the largest divisor found.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly finds the integer `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` by iterating from `x-1` down to `2` and checking the conditions as described.
Correctness: **True**
