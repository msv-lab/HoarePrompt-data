Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always find the integer \( y \) (1 \(\le\) \( y \) < \( x \)) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). 

Let's analyze the code:

```python
def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    max_val = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            if 2 * y >= x:
                return y
            max_val = y
    return max_val
```

The code iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2, checking if \( x \% y == 0 \) (i.e., if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \)). If \( y \) is a divisor and \( 2 * y \ge x \), it immediately returns \( y \). Otherwise, it updates `max_val` to \( y \) and continues. Finally, it returns `max_val`.

The problem is that the code does not guarantee that it finds the \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). It only returns the first divisor it finds that satisfies \( 2 * y \ge x \), which might not be optimal.

For example, consider \( x = 10 \):
- The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.
- The code will check 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.
- When it checks 5, it finds that \( 10 \% 5 == 0 \) and \( 2 * 5 \ge 10 \), so it returns 5.
- However, \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).
- If we check \( y = 6 \), \(\gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8\).
- If we check \( y = 9 \), \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).

Here, \( y = 9 \) also gives the maximum value of 10, but the code does not consider it because it does not satisfy \( 2 * y \ge x \).

Thus, the code does not always find the optimal \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
