The code snippet `inc = -1` changes the value of `inc` from its previous value to `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.

Output State: **`i` remains `m + 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `end` is `0`; `inc` is `-1`; `d1` has keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding `s` values; `d2` remains a defaultdict with default int value of `0`; `mini` holds the minimum absolute difference calculated during the last iteration; `s` is the accumulated sum based on the conditions in the loop; `lst` remains unchanged; `m`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
