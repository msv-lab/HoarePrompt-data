The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `i` to be the incremented value.

State: **`start` is the first integer from the new input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the new input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration, `d1` remains unchanged, `d2` has entries for each `start` position from `len(lst) - 1` to `1`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged. If `start` is less than `end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment.

State: **`start` is the first integer from the new input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the new input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration, `d1` remains unchanged, `d2` has entries for each `start` position from `len(lst) - 1` to `1`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged. If `start` is less than `end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

To be more specific, if `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`start` is the first integer from the new input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the new input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration, `d1` remains unchanged, `d2` has entries for each `start` position from `len(lst) - 1` to `1`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged. If `start` is less than `end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can say that `i` is incremented by 1.
