Output State: **`start` is the first input integer minus 1, `end` is the second input integer minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference in the last iteration, `d1` is unchanged, `d2` contains accumulated `s` values, `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`.**

In this output state, the value of `s2` has been calculated as the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
