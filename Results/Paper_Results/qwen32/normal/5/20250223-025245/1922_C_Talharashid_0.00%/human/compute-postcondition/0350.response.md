The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the elements at the `start` and `end` indices of the list `d2` and assigns it to the variable `s2`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `start` is less than `end`, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`**

In natural language: The variable `s2` is now assigned the value of the absolute difference between the elements at the `start` and `end` indices of the list `d2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
