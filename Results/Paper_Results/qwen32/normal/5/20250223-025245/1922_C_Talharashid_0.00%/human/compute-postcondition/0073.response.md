Output State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is either 1 or 2. If `start - 1 > -1`, then `mini` is the minimum of `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged. `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values representing the accumulated `s` at each `start`, and `d2[start]` is `s`.**

Natural language: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so if it was 0, it is now 1, and if it was 1, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
