Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `m + 1`, `start` is `0`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is `0`, `inc` is `1`, `mini` is unchanged, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0`, `m`, `t`, and `n` are unchanged, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `m + 1`, `start` is `1`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is `1`, `mini` is the minimum of `11111111`, `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, and `abs(lst[0] - lst[-1])` if `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)` and `start - 1` is greater than `-1`, otherwise `mini` is the minimum of `11111111` and `abs(lst[0] - lst[-1])` if `start - 1` is greater than `-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0` and `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0`, `m`, `t`, and `n` are unchanged, and `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is `1`. Otherwise, `s` is `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is `m + 1`, `start` is `2`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is `1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0` and `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0`, `m`, `t`, and `n` are unchanged, and `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element. If `start - 1 > -1`, then `mini` is updated to `min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)`. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is `1`. Otherwise, `s` is `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` depending on the condition. If `start + 1` is not less than `len(lst)`, then the values of `mini` and `s` remain unchanged. If `start - 1` is not greater than `-1`, the values of `mini` and `s` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is `m + 1`, `start` is `3`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is `1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0` and `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0`, `m`, `t`, and `n` are unchanged, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is `min(mini, abs(lst[2] - lst[1]))`. Otherwise, `mini` remains `11111111`. Specifically, if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `d1[start]` is `s + 1`. Otherwise, `d1[start]` is `s + abs(lst[2] - lst[3])`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
