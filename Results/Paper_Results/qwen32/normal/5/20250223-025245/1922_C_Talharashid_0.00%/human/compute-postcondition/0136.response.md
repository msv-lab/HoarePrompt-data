To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head is `while start != end:`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `start` is not equal to `end`.

Given the initial state:
- `start` is 0
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`

For the loop to execute, `start` must not be equal to `end`. Since `end` is initialized to `len(lst) - 1`, it will be equal to `start` only if `len(lst)` is 1 (i.e., the list has only one element). If `len(lst)` is greater than 1, `start` (which is 0) will not be equal to `end` (which is `len(lst) - 1`).

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that the list `lst` has more than one element. No other variables in the loop head (`start` and `end`) need to be adjusted directly; instead, we need to adjust the state of `lst` to ensure its length is greater than 1.

State: **`start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference in the last iteration, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers from the input with more than one element**
