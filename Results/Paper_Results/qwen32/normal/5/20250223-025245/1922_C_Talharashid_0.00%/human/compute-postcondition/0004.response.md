The provided code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the value of `n` will be updated based on the user's input, but the precondition for `n` (that it is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) is no longer valid because the input could be any integer. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_n` ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5, and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x_i`, `y_i` ≤ `n` and `x_i` ≠ `y_i`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0.**
