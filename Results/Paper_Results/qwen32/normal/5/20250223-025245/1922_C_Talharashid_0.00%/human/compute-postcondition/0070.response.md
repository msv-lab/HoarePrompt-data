Postcondition: **`start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is either 0 or 1, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values representing the accumulated `s` at each `start`, `d2[start]` is `s`.**
