Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `s` is `0`, `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` and corresponding values of `s` (before this line was executed), `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `lst` is a list of integers from the input.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `s` is either `1` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, or `abs(lst[len(lst) - 1] - lst[len(lst) - 2])` otherwise, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` and corresponding values of `0` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, or `s` otherwise, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d2[start]` is `s`, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `lst` is a list of integers from the input. `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` if the condition is met, otherwise `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `s` is either `2` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` otherwise, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` and corresponding values of `0` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, or `s - 1` if `s` was updated, or `s` otherwise, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d2[start]` is `s`, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, and `mini` is the minimum of `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `s` is either `3` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]) + 1` if `mini != abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` and corresponding values of `0` if `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, or `s - 1` if `s` was updated, or `s` otherwise, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory and `d2[start]` is `s`, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, and `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`. If `start - 1 <= -1`, `mini` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
