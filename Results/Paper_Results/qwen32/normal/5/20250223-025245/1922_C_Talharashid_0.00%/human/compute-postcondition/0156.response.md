Postcondition: **`start` is 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 1 if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, otherwise `s` is `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, and 11111111, `d1` is a defaultdict with `d1[start]` set to `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` is greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `lst` is a list of integers from the input with more than one element. If `start - 1` is greater than -1, then `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. Otherwise, no change is made to `mini`.**
