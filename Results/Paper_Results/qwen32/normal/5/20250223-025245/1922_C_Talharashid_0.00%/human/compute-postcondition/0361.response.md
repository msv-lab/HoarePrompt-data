Initial State: `i` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `s` is 0. If `start` (originally from the input) is less than `end` (originally from the input), then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start - 1])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start - 1] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start - 1])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start - 1] - d1[end])`.

Given the code snippet:
```
s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
```

The code updates the value of `s1` to `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`.** 

In natural language: The value of `s1` is now the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
