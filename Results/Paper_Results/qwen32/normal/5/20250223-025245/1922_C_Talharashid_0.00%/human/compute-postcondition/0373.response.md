The code snippet `s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` updates the value of `s2` to the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 2, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`.**

In simple terms, the value of `s2` is now the absolute difference between the elements at the `start` and `end` indices of the list `d2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
