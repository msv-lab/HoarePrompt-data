Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from the input, `s` is 0. If `start` (originally from the input) is less than `end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start - 1])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start - 1] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start - 1])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start - 1] - d1[end])`.**

In simple terms, `start` has been decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for `s1` and `s2` are adjusted to reflect the new value of `start`.
