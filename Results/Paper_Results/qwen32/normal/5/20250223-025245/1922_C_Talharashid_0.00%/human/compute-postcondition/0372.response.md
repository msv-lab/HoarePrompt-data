The code snippet provided reassigns the value of `s1` to be `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`. This means that the previous value of `s1` is overwritten with the new calculation, regardless of the initial condition specified for `s1` in the initial state.

Therefore, the new value of `s1` will be `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 2, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` if the first integer from the input is less than the second integer from the input, otherwise `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
