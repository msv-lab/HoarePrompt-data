You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Cities on a Number Line**: Cities are given in ascending order on a number line.
2. **Closest City**: For each city, there is a uniquely determined closest city.
3. **Travel Options**: 
   - Travel directly to any other city, paying the absolute distance.
   - Travel to the closest city, paying 1 coin.
4. **Queries**: For each query, determine the minimum coins required to travel between two cities.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. **Reading Input**: It reads the number of test cases, the number of cities, their positions, the number of queries, and the queries themselves.
2. **Calculating Distances**:
   - It calculates the minimum coins required to travel from the first city to each subsequent city (`d1`).
   - It calculates the minimum coins required to travel from the last city to each previous city (`d2`).
3. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, it determines the minimum coins required by comparing the costs calculated in `d1` and `d2`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the distance using a loop that doesn't properly account for the closest city logic.
   - It uses a hardcoded large value `111111111` for `mini` which is not appropriate.
   - The logic to determine the closest city and calculate the cost is flawed. It doesn't correctly implement the closest city logic and instead seems to be trying to sum distances.

2. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The program incorrectly uses the precomputed distances from `d1` and `d2` to answer the queries.
   - It doesn't properly handle the travel cost between arbitrary cities using the closest city logic.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. **Determine the Closest City**: For each city, determine its closest city.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost to travel between any two cities using the closest city logic.
3. **Answer Queries**: For each query, determine the minimum cost using the precomputed values.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It incorrectly calculates distances and does not properly handle the closest city logic.
