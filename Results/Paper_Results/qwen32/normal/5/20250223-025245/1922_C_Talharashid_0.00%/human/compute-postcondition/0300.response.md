Initial State: 
- `i` remains `m + 1`.
- `start` will be `len(lst) - 1`.
- `end` remains `len(lst) - 1`.
- `inc` remains `1`.
- `d1` will have keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding `s` values.
- `d2` remains a defaultdict with default int value of `0`.
- `mini` will hold the minimum absolute difference calculated during the last iteration.
- `s` will be the accumulated sum based on the conditions in the loop.
- `lst` remains unchanged.
- `m`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Given that the loop has terminated, the only variables that have been updated are `start` and `d1` (and possibly `s` and `mini` based on the loop's operations). However, since the task specifies the final state with `start` and `d1` being the only variables that have definitive changes, we will focus on these.

The final output state is that `start` has reached the last index of the list (`len(lst) - 1`), and the loop has terminated. The dictionary `d1` contains the accumulated sums `s` for each index from `1` to `len(lst) - 1`. The value of `s` is the final accumulated sum based on the conditions checked in each iteration of the loop. All other variables remain in their initial states except for `d1` and `s`.

Output State: **`i` remains `m + 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `end` remains `len(lst) - 1`; `inc` remains `1`; `d1` has keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding `s` values; `d2` remains a defaultdict with default int value of `0`; `mini` holds the minimum absolute difference calculated during the last iteration; `s` is the accumulated sum based on the conditions in the loop; `lst` remains unchanged; `m`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.**

Natural language: The loop has terminated, and `start` is now set to the last index of the list (`len(lst) - 1`). The dictionary `d1` contains the accumulated sums for each index from `1` to `len(lst) - 1`. The value of `s` is the final accumulated sum based on the loop's conditions. All other variables remain unchanged.
