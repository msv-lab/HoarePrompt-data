Postcondition: **`i` is `m + 1`, `start` is `2`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is `1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0` and `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int value of `0`, `m`, `t`, and `n` are unchanged, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element. If `start + 1 < len(lst)`, `mini` is `min(11111111, abs(lst[2] - lst[3]))`. Otherwise, `mini` remains `11111111`.**
