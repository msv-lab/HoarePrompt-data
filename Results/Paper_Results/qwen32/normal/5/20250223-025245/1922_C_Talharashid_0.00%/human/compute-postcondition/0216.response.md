Output State: **`start` is `0`, `end` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `s` is the accumulated sum of absolute differences or increments, `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration, `d1` remains unchanged, `d2` has entries for each `start` position from `len(lst) - 1` to `1`, `m` is an input integer, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged.**
In simple terms, after running the code, the variable `m` is assigned the value of an input integer provided by the user. All other variables retain their initial values.
