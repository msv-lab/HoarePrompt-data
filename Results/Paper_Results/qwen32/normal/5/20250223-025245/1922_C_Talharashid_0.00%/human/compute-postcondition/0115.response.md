The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`start` is the first input integer minus 1, `end` is the second input integer minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference in the last iteration, `d1` is unchanged, `d2` contains accumulated `s` values, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now `i + 1`). If `start < end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

Since the only variable we can adjust in the loop head is `i`, and `i` has been incremented by 1, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`start` is the first input integer minus 1, `end` is the second input integer minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference in the last iteration, `d1` is unchanged, `d2` contains accumulated `s` values, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`.**
