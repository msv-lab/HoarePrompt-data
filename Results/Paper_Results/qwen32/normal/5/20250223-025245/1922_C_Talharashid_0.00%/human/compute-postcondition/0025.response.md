The only variable in the loop head is `start` and `end`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `start` is not equal to `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is either 1 or greater than 0, and `end` is `len(lst) - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must be less than `end`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `start` is not equal to `end` by adjusting `start` if necessary.

Given that `end` is fixed as `len(lst) - 1`, we need to ensure that `start` is less than `end`. If `start` is currently equal to `end`, we need to decrement `start` by 1 to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_n` ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5; for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x_i`, `y_i` ≤ `n` and `x_i` ≠ `y_i`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[start] = s`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have more than one element; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `inc` is 1; `s` is either 0 or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`; `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start` > 0, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111; `start` is either 1 or greater than 0 and `start` must be less than `end`**
