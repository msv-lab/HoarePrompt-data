Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_n` ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5; for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x_i`, `y_i` ≤ `n` and `x_i` ≠ `y_i`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[start] = s`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input and must have more than one element; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `inc` is 1; `start` is less than `end`. If `start + 1 < len(lst)`, then `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `s` is updated based on the condition `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `start` is incremented by `inc`, and `d1[start]` is updated to `s`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `mini`, `s`, `start`, or `d1[start]`.**
