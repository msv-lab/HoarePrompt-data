The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `a` represents the number of test cases, and for the loop to execute, there must be at least one test case.

The state of `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range(a)` function in the for loop.

State: **`a` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not adjusted before the loop starts**
