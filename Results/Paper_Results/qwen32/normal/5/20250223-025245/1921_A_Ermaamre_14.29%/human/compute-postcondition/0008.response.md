The code calculates the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` and assigns it to `res`. Given the initial state, `y1` is less than `y3`, so `res` will be `y3 - y1`.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not adjusted, `x1` is the first integer from the input, `x2` is the third integer from the input, `x3` is the fifth integer from the input, `x4` is the seventh integer from the input, `y1` is the second integer from the input, `y2` is the fourth integer from the input, `y3` is the sixth integer from the input, `y4` is the eighth integer from the input, `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`. Additionally, `y1` is less than `y3`. `res` is `y3 - y1`.**
