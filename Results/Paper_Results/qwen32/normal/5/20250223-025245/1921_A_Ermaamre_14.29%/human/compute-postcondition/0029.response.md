To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the conditions and the calculation of `res` based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `a` is greater than or equal to 1 (though `a` is not directly used in the calculation of `res`).
2. `i` is not adjusted (though `i` is not directly used in the calculation of `res`).
3. `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` retain their input values.
4. The value of `res` is determined by the following conditions:
   - If `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.
   - Otherwise, if `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.
   - Additionally, if `x1` equals `x4` and `x3` equals `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `y1` is less than `y2`; otherwise, `res` is `y1 - y2`.

### Calculation of `res`:
- **Condition 1:** If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res = abs(y1 - y3)`.
- **Condition 2:** If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res = abs(y1 - y2)`.
- **Condition 3:** If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res = abs(y2 - y1)` if `y1 < y2`; otherwise, `res = y1 - y2`.

### Output Calculation:
The print statement is `print(res ** 2)`, which means we need to square the value of `res` and print it.

### Explanation and Output:
Given the conditions, the value of `res` will be an absolute difference or a difference based on the coordinates provided. The exact numerical value of `res` depends on the specific values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4`.

Since the specific values of these coordinates are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the square of the calculated `res`.

Output: **res ** 2 (where res is calculated based on the conditions provided and the specific values of x1, x2, x3, x4, y1, y2, y3, and y4)**
