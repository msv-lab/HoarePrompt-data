The code calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns it to `res`. Given the initial conditions, the values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` remain unchanged except for the new variable `res` which is calculated as `abs(y2 - y1)`.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not adjusted, `x1` is the first integer from the input, `y1` is the second integer from the input, `x2` is the third integer from the input, `y2` is the fourth integer from the input, `x3` is the fifth integer from the input, `y3` is the sixth integer from the input, `x4` and `y4` are the seventh and eighth integers from the input, respectively, and `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`. Additionally, `y1` is less than `y2`. `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.**
