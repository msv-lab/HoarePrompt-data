The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has already been incremented. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `a` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `a`. Since `i` has already been incremented, we need to ensure that the incremented value of `i` is still less than `a`.

State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` is now the value it will hold at the start of the next iteration), `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are the input integers. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`. If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y2`. Otherwise, `res` is not defined.**
