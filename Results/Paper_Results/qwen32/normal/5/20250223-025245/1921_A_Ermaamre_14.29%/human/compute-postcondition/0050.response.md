The code snippet assigns the values of `x2` and `y2` by reading two integers from the input. The initial state indicates that `x2` and `y2` were previously input integers, but now they are being reassigned based on the new input. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, and `res`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1` are the input integers, `x2`, `y2` are the newly input integers, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are the input integers, `res` is not defined.**
