The code snippet `x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `x2` and `y2` respectively. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`) retain their initial values.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1` and `y1` are the input integers, `x2` and `y2` are the newly input integers, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` retain their input values.**
