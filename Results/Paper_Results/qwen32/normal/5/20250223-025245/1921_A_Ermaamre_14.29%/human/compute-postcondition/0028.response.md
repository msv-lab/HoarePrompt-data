Postcondition: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not adjusted, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` retain their input values. If `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`. Otherwise, if `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. Additionally, if `x1` equals `x4` and `x3` equals `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `y1` is less than `y2`; otherwise, `res` is `y1 - y2`.**
