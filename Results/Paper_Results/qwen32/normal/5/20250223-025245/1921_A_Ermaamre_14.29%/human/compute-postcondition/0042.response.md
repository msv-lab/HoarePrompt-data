Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1` and `y1` are the input integers, `x2` and `y2` are the newly input integers, `x3` and `y3` are the newly input integers, `x4` and `y4` are the newly input integers, `res` is the absolute value of `y1 - y2`.**

Natural Language: After executing the code, `res` is assigned the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
