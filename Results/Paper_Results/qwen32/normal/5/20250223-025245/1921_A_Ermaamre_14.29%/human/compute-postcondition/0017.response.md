The code calculates the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to the variable `res`. Since `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, `res` will be `y1 - y2`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not adjusted, `x1` is the first integer from the input, `x2` is the second integer from the input, `x3` is the third integer from the input, `x4` is the fourth integer from the input, `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, `y1` is the fifth integer from the input, `y2` is the sixth integer from the input, `y3` is the seventh integer from the input, `y4` is the eighth integer from the input, `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, `res` is `y1 - y2`.**
