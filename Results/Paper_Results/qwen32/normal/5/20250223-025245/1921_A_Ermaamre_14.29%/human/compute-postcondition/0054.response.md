The code snippet assigns the variable `res` the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y3`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1` are the input integers, `x2`, `y2` are the newly input integers, `x3`, `y3` are the newly input integers, `x4`, `y4` are the newly input integers, `res` is the absolute value of `y1 - y3`.
Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1` are the input integers, `x2`, `y2` are the newly input integers, `x3`, `y3` are the newly input integers, `x4`, `y4` are the newly input integers, `res` is `abs(y1 - y3)`**.
