### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to calculate the area of a square given its four corners, with the sides of the square being parallel to the coordinate axes.

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads four lines of input, each representing the coordinates of one corner of the square. The program then calculates the side length of the square and computes the area by squaring the side length.

Let's analyze the logic of the program:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
3. It then checks different possible pairings of x-coordinates to determine which two pairs of corners share the same x-coordinate, indicating they are vertical edges of the square.
4. Once it identifies the vertical edges, it calculates the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of these corners.
5. The program then calculates the area by squaring the side length.

However, there is a logical flaw in the code. The program only checks three possible pairings of x-coordinates but does not handle all possible configurations of the corners. Specifically, if the first corner does not match the third or fourth corner in x-coordinates, the program does not correctly identify the vertical edges in all cases.

For example, if the corners are given in the order (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4) where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) form one pair of vertical edges, and (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) form the other pair, the program may not correctly identify these pairs, especially if the first corner does not match either the third or fourth corner in x-coordinates.

To handle all cases correctly, the program should sort the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately and then determine the side length based on the differences in the x or y coordinates of the sorted values.
