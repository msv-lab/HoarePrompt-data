The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x3` and `y3`. The initial state of the other variables (`a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not adjusted, `x1` is the first integer from the input, `y1` is the second integer from the input, `x2` is the third integer from the input, `y2` is the fourth integer from the input, `x3` is the fifth integer from the input, `y3` is the sixth integer from the input.**
