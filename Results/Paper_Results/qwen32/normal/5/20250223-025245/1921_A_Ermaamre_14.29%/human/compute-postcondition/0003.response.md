The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x2` and `y2`. The initial state specifies that `a` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is not adjusted before the loop starts. The values of `x1` and `y1` are given as the first and second integers from the input, respectively. After executing the code, `x2` and `y2` will be assigned the new integers from the input, while `a`, `i`, `x1`, and `y1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not adjusted, `x1` is the first integer from the input, `y1` is the second integer from the input, `x2` is the third integer from the input, `y2` is the fourth integer from the input.**
