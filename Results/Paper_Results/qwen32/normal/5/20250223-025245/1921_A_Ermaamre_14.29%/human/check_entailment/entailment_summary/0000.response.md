### Reasoning:
The provided Python program aims to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The key steps in the program are as follows:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.
2. **Area Calculation**: The program attempts to determine the side length of the square by comparing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the corners. It then calculates the area as the square of the side length.
3. **Output**: The program prints the calculated area for each test case.

The logic in the program is based on the assumption that the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes. Therefore, the side length of the square can be determined by the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the appropriate corners.

Let's break down the logic for determining the side length:
- If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then the square is aligned such that two sides are vertical, and the side length can be determined by the difference in the y-coordinates of the corners.
- If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then the square is aligned such that two sides are horizontal, and the side length can be determined by the difference in the y-coordinates of the corners.
- If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then the square is aligned such that two sides are horizontal, and the side length can be determined by the difference in the y-coordinates of the corners.

The program correctly identifies the side length based on these conditions and calculates the area by squaring the side length.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Coordinates: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
   - Side length: abs(5 - 2) = 3
   - Area: 3^2 = 9

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Coordinates: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
   - Side length: abs(1 - (-1)) = 2
   - Area: 2^2 = 4

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Coordinates: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
   - Side length: abs(39 - 11) = 28
   - Area: 28^2 = 784

The program correctly calculates the area for all test cases in the example.

### Conclusion:
Based on the reasoning and verification, the provided program correctly calculates the area of the square for the given test cases and adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
