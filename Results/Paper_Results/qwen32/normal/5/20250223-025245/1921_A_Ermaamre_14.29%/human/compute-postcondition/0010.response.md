The code calculates the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` and assigns this value to `res`. Given that `y1` is greater than or equal to `y3`, the absolute difference is simply `y1 - y3`.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not adjusted, `x1` is the first integer from the input, `x2` is the third integer from the input, `x3` is the fifth integer from the input, `x4` is the seventh integer from the input, `y1` is the second integer from the input, `y2` is the fourth integer from the input, `y3` is the sixth integer from the input, `y4` is the eighth integer from the input, `x1` equals `x3`, and `x2` equals `x4`. Additionally, `y1` is greater than or equal to `y3`, `res` is `y1 - y3`.**
