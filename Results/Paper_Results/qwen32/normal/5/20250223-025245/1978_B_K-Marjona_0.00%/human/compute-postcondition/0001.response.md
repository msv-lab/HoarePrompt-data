The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state only specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, which is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b` as integers derived from the input, and the condition for `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.**
