Let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `k` is calculated as `min(n, b - a)`.
- `b` is greater than `a`.

### Code Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

Let's break down the expression step by step:

1. **Calculate `k`:**
   - `k = min(n, b - a)`

2. **Calculate the first part of the expression `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`:**
   - `b + (b - k + 1)`: This is the sum of `b` and `b - k + 1`.
   - `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2`: This is the integer division of the sum by 2.
   - The entire expression `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` is then multiplied by `k`.

3. **Calculate the second part of the expression `(n - k) * a`:**
   - `n - k`: This is the difference between `n` and `k`.
   - The entire expression `(n - k) * a` is then multiplied by `a`.

4. **Sum the two parts:**
   - The final result is the sum of the two parts calculated above.

### Final Output Description:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a` where `k` is `min(n, b - a)`.

To provide a more precise description, let's denote:
- `k` as `min(n, b - a)`.
- The first part of the expression as `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k`.
- The second part of the expression as `(n - k) * a`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k + (n - k) * a (where k = min(n, b - a))**
