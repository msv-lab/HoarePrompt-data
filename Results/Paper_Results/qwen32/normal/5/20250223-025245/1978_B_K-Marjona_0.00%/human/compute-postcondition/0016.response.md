The code snippet `k = min(n, b - a)` updates the value of `k` to be the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n`, `a`, and `b` are the new integers read from the input; `k` is `min(n, b - a)`**
