Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9 inclusive) and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'NONE' if `a == b == c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and 'NONE' otherwise.**
