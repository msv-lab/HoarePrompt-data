Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input.
- It is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`. This means the sequence `a < b < c` does not hold.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal.
- The current value of `b` is the maximum among `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. It simply prints the string `'PEAK'`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` as long as they satisfy the given conditions.

Output: **PEAK**
