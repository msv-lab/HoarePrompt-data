Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if a < b < c:
        print('STAIR')
    elif a == b == c:
        print('NONE')
    elif max(a, b, c) == b:
        print('PEAK')
    else:
        print('NONE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input. If `a < b < c`, then the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this condition. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, then `a = b = c`. If they are not all equal, and `b` is the maximum among `a`, `b`, and `c`, then `b` is the maximum value; otherwise, the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is not `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a < b < c`, the program behaves as described in the if part. Otherwise, if `a` equals `b` equals `c`, the program behaves as described in the if part. In all other cases, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and the increment of `i` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `i` is incremented by 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user, separated by spaces. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, the condition `a < b < c` holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold, but the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
