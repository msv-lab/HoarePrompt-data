You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9 inclusive) and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'NONE' if `a == b == c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and 'NONE' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's go through the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c`. If true, it prints "STAIR" indicating a stair.
   - Then, it checks if `a == b == c`. If true, it prints "NONE". However, this condition is unnecessary because if `a == b == c`, it does not satisfy either `a < b < c` or `a < b > c` and will correctly fall into the "NONE" else clause. This condition can be removed without affecting the correctness.
   - Next, it checks if `max(a, b, c) == b`. If true, it prints "PEAK". This condition is intended to catch cases where `b` is the largest number and `a < b > c`, which correctly identifies a peak.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly identifies "STAIR" when `a < b < c`.
   - The program correctly identifies "PEAK" when `a < b > c`.
   - The program correctly identifies "NONE" when neither of the above conditions are met.

However, the condition `elif a == b == c:` is redundant because if `a == b == c`, the program will print "NONE" in the `else` clause anyway because neither `a < b < c` nor `max(a, b, c) == b` will be true.

Despite this redundancy, the program still produces the correct output for all test cases as per the problem description.

**Correctness:** **True**
