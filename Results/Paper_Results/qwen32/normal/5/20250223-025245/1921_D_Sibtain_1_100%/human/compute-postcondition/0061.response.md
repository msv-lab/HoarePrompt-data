The code snippet `ans += max(t1, t2)` calculates the maximum value between `t1` and `t2` and adds it to the variable `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer
- `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order
- `ans` is 0
- `k` is 0
- `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`
- `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`
- If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is 2. Otherwise, `j` is 1 and `i` is 1

After executing the code `ans += max(t1, t2)`, the variable `ans` will be updated to `max(t1, t2)`. The other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`; `k` is 0; `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`; If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is 2. Otherwise, `j` is 1 and `i` is 1.**
