The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the last `j`th elements of the lists `a` and `c` and assigns it to the variable `t2`. The value of `j` is 1, so it calculates the absolute difference between the last elements of both lists.

Given:
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- `j` is 1.

The calculation is:
- `t2 = abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[0])`.

Since `a` is sorted in ascending order, `a[len(a) - 1]` is the largest element in `a`.
Since `c` is sorted in descending order, `c[0]` is the largest element in `c`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is 0; `k` is len(a) - 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `t1` is abs(a[0] - c[0]); `t2` is abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[0])**
