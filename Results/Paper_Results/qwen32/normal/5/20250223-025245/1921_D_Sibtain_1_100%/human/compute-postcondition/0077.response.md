To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the context and the calculations involved in determining the value of `ans`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
2. `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
3. `a` is a sorted list of integers.
4. `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order.
5. `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated in each iteration.
6. `k` is `len(a) - 1`.
7. `i` and `j` are values based on the comparisons made during the loop.

### Calculation of `ans`:
The variable `ans` is calculated by summing up the maximum absolute differences between elements of the lists `a` and `c` during a loop. Typically, this involves iterating over the elements of the lists and computing the differences.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following for a clearer understanding:
- `a = [1, 3, 5]` (sorted in ascending order)
- `c = [9, 7, 2]` (sorted in descending order)

The loop would typically look something like this:
1. Initialize `ans` to 0.
2. For each element in `a` and `c`, compute the absolute difference and add the maximum of these differences to `ans`.

For example:
- First iteration: `abs(a[0] - c[0]) = abs(1 - 9) = 8`
- Second iteration: `abs(a[1] - c[1]) = abs(3 - 7) = 4`
- Third iteration: `abs(a[2] - c[2]) = abs(5 - 2) = 3`

In this case, the maximum absolute difference in each iteration is added to `ans`:
- `ans = 8 + 4 + 3 = 15`

### General Case:
Without the exact values of `a` and `c`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the value of `ans` based on the provided information.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated in each iteration of the loop, where `a` and `c` are lists of integers sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of the sorted lists `a` and `c`)**
