The value of `t1` is assigned the absolute difference between the first elements of the sorted list `a` and the sorted list `c` in descending order. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `k` is 0; `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`**.
