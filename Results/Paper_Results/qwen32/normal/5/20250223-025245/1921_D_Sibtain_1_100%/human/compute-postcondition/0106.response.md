The code snippet provided increments the `ans` variable by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. Given the initial state, `ans` is already defined as `max(t1, t2)`, and the code will add the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to it again. Therefore, `ans` will be doubled in terms of the maximum difference calculated between corresponding elements of the lists `a` and `c`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `2 * max(t1, t2)`; `k` is len(a) - 1; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` remains 2; otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 (so if `i` was 0, `i` is now 1, and if `i` was 1, `i` is now 2).**

In simpler terms, `ans` is now twice the maximum absolute difference between corresponding elements of the lists `a` and `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.
