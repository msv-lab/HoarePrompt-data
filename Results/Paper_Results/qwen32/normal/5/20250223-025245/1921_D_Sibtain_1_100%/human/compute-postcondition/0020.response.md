Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0; `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. Additionally, `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`.**
