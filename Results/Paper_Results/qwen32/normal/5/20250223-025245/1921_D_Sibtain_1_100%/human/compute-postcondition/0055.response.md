The code snippet assigns a new value to `t2` based on the absolute difference between the `j`-th last elements of `a` and `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `t2` is now calculated as `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. Since `j` is 1, `t2` becomes `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`, which is the absolute difference between the last elements of `a` and `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `k` is 0; `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`**.
