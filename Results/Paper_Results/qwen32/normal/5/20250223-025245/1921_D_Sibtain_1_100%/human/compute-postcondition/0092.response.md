The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the first elements of the lists `a` and `c` and assigns this value to the new variable `t1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is 0; `k` is len(a) - 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `t1` is abs(a[0] - c[0])**
