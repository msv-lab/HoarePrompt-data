The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or conditions outside of the loop. Since there is no loop structure provided in the context, the `continue` statement does not have any impact on the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, or `k`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration; `i` is a value between 0 and len(a) - 1; `j` is a value between 1 and len(a); `k` is len(a) - 1.**
