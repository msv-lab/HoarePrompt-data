### Reasoning:

The given problem requires maximizing the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) by selecting and arranging \( n \) integers from the list \( b \) to form the array \( c \).

The provided program follows a logical approach to achieve this:
1. **Input Parsing**: It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Special Case Handling**: If all elements in \( a \) and \( b \) are the same, the maximum difference \( D \) is zero.
3. **Sorting**: It sorts the array \( a \) in ascending order and the array \( b \) in descending order. This helps in maximizing the difference between elements of \( a \) and \( b \).
4. **Two Pointers Technique**: It uses a two-pointer technique to maximize the difference:
   - It maintains two pointers, one at the start of the sorted \( a \) and one at the start of the sorted \( b \) (in reverse order).
   - For each element in \( a \), it compares the absolute differences between the current elements of \( a \) and the two pointers in \( b \).
   - It adds the maximum of these differences to the total difference \( D \) and moves the pointer that provided the smaller difference.
5. **Edge Cases**: It handles edge cases such as when \( n = 1 \) by directly calculating the maximum difference between the single element in \( a \) and the maximum or minimum element in \( b \).

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the difference \( D \) for each test case as per the problem statement.
