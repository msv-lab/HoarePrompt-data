The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`, that will follow. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of integers representing the vertices) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5); `y` is 0; The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
