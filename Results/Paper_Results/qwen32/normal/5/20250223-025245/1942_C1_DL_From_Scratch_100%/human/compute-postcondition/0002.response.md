The provided code snippet `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` will read a line of input, split it into three parts, and convert each part into an integer. These integers will then be assigned to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial state provided includes `n`, `x`, and `y` with specific constraints, but the code snippet will overwrite the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` with the new input values.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state will be:
- `n` will be the first integer from the input.
- `x` will be the second integer from the input.
- `y` will be the third integer from the input.
- The variables `T` and `t` will remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input.**
