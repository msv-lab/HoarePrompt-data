You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, until it reaches the middle of the list. It then prints this sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. Specifically, the beauty is calculated as:

\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. The optimal strategy is to arrange the array in such a way that the largest elements are as far as possible from the smallest elements. One effective way to achieve this is by sorting the array and then pairing the smallest and largest elements to maximize the difference.

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows this strategy:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
3. It sorts the array in ascending order.
4. It then calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, moving towards the center of the array.

Let's break down the key part of the program:
```python
a.sort()
kq = 0
for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
    kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
```

- `a.sort()` sorts the array in ascending order.
- `kq` is initialized to 0.
- The loop runs from `0` to `len(a) // 2`, which means it pairs the smallest and largest elements, the second smallest and second largest, and so on.
- In each iteration, it adds the difference between the current largest and smallest elements to `kq`.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the problem statement:
- Input: `3 2 1 3`
- After sorting: `[1, 2, 3]`
- The loop runs for `i = 0`:
  - `kq = 0 + (a[2] - a[0]) = 0 + (3 - 1) = 2`
- The beauty is `2`, which matches the expected output.

For other test cases, the program should also produce the correct results following the same logic.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting the array and summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
