The value of `kq` is updated by adding the difference between the element at the `len(a) - i - 1` index and the element at the `i` index of the list `a`. The values of `a`, `itest`, `ntest`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `kq` is 0.
- `itest` is `itest_prev + 1`.
- `ntest` remains the same.
- `n` is an input integer.

The new value of `kq` will be `0 + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `kq` is `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`; `itest` is `itest_prev + 1`; `ntest` remains the same; `n` is an input integer.**
