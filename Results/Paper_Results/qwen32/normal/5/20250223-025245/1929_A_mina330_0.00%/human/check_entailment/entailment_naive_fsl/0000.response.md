Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The logic in the code is flawed in the way it sums the differences between elements to calculate the beauty.

The code sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on. However, this approach does not necessarily yield the maximum possible beauty.

To maximize the beauty, the optimal strategy is to arrange the elements in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then arranging the elements in an alternating fashion (largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, etc.).

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue with the given code:

**Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
Expected Output:
```
4
```
Explanation:
The maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the array as [1, 4, 2, 3]. The beauty is calculated as:
(4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 + (-2) + 1 = 2

However, if we follow the logic of the given code, the array would be sorted as [1, 2, 3, 4] and the beauty would be calculated as:
(4 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 1 = 4

But the code does not follow this optimal arrangement. Instead, it pairs the largest and smallest elements, which does not always yield the maximum beauty.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.
