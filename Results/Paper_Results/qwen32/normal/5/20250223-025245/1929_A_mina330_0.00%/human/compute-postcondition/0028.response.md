The only variable in the loop head is `itest`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `itest` and `ntest`. If `itest` is less than `ntest`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `itest` is `itest_prev + 1`.

Given that `itest` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `itest` should be `itest + 1`.

State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers; `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(a) // 2 - 1`; `itest` is `itest + 1`; `ntest` remains the same; `n` is an input integer.**
