The code snippet provided is:
```python
ntest = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `ntest`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 500`, but this variable `t` is not directly affected by the provided code snippet. The variable `ntest` is newly introduced and assigned the value of the input.

Therefore, the Output State will be:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `ntest` is an integer read from input.**
