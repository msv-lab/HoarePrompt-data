Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `0`
- `n` is an input integer
- `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}`
- `nums` is `[5]`
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `3`, `res` is set to `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` is not defined.

Since `cnt` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we will consider two cases:
1. `cnt` is greater than or equal to `3`
2. `cnt` is less than `3`

However, for the calculation of `total_sum`, the value of `cnt` is crucial. Let's proceed with the calculation for both cases:

### Case 1: `cnt` is greater than or equal to `3`
In this case, `cnt` could be `3`, `4`, `5`, etc. Since `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}`, the only value in `num_of_lens` is `1` which is associated with the key `5`. The condition `if i != cnt` will be true if `cnt` is not `1`. Since `cnt` is greater than or equal to `3`, the condition is always true, and the sum will include the value `1`.

Thus, `total_sum` will be `1`.

### Case 2: `cnt` is less than `3`
In this case, `cnt` could be `0`, `1`, or `2`. If `cnt` is `1`, the condition `if i != cnt` will be false because `i` is `1`. Therefore, the sum will not include any values, and `total_sum` will be `0`. If `cnt` is `0` or `2`, the condition will be true, and the sum will include the value `1`.

Thus, `total_sum` will be `1` if `cnt` is `0` or `2`, and `0` if `cnt` is `1`.

Since the exact value of `cnt` is not provided, we cannot definitively determine `total_sum` without more information. However, we can describe the possible states based on the value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}`, `nums` is `[5]`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `3` or `cnt` is `0` or `2`, `total_sum` is `1`. If `cnt` is `1`, `total_sum` is `0`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `3`, `res` is set to `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` is not defined.**
