In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `_` and the range is determined by the variable `t`. The loop will execute `t` times. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The state of `t` is already given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), which means the loop will execute at least once without any adjustments to `t`.

The variables `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are mentioned in the description of the input for each test case, but they are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. They will be used inside the loop body, which is omitted in the provided code snippet.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the given loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
