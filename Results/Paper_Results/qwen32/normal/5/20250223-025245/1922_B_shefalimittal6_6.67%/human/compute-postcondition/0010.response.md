Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is incremented by 1 if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, or set to 1 if `x` was not previously in `num_of_lens`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least two integers; `x` is the next element in `nums` after the current one; the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, or set to 1 if `x` was not previously in `num_of_lens`.**

In simple terms, the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` is increased by 1 if `x` already exists in the dictionary. If `x` does not exist in the dictionary, it is added with a value of 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
