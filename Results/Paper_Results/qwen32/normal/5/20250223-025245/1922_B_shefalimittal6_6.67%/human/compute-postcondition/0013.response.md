In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. The loop variable `cnt` takes on the value of each element in `num_of_lens.values()` during each iteration. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the state of `num_of_lens` since the loop head directly depends on it. The loop will execute if `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:
1. **`t`**: This variable is mentioned, but it is not used in the loop head. It does not need to be adjusted.
2. **`n`**: This variable is mentioned, but it is not used in the loop head. It does not need to be adjusted.
3. **`num_of_lens`**: This dictionary must have at least one key-value pair for the loop to execute.
4. **`nums`**: This list is used to populate `num_of_lens`, but since the loop head only depends on `num_of_lens`, we do not need to adjust `nums` directly. However, to ensure `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair, `nums` must contain at least one integer.
5. **`res`**: This variable is mentioned, but it is not used in the loop head. It does not need to be adjusted.

Given the above considerations, the state should be adjusted to ensure `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair, which implies `nums` must have at least one integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `res` is 0**
