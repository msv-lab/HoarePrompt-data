Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that `t` equals the length of `nums`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the counts of each unique integer in `nums` incremented by 1 for each occurrence; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that `t` equals the length of `nums`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, where the value is the count of a unique integer in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2 if the if condition was met; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` equals the length of `nums`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, where the value is the count of a unique integer in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `cnt` is set to the next value in `num_of_lens` that has not been iterated over; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that `t` equals the length of `nums`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, where the value is the count of a unique integer in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is updated based on the previous `cnt` value if `cnt` was greater than or equal to 2, and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` was indeed greater than or equal to 2; `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens` that has not been iterated over; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the new `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, no additional updates are made to `res`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
