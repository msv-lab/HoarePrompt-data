The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` updates the value of `res` by adding the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum` to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are part of the expression that modifies `res`.

Given the initial state, the value of `res` is updated as follows:
- `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, `total_sum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` equals the length of `nums`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, where the value is the count of a unique integer in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**
