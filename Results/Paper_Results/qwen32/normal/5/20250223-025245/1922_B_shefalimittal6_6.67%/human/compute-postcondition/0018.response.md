The code calculates `total_sum` by summing the values in the `num_of_lens` dictionary where the value is not equal to `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains 0; `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`.**
