The code `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` increments the value of `res` by the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items, calculated using the `math.comb` function.

Given that `res` was initially 0, its new value will be `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`; `cnt` is an integer and its current value is greater than or equal to 3.**
