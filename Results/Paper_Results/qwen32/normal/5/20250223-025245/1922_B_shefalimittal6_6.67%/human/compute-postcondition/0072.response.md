The code snippet provided updates the `nums` variable by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual components, converting each component to an integer, and then collecting these integers into a list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `res`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `len(nums) - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is {}, `nums` is the list of integers from the input, and `res` is updated to the accumulated sum based on the counts in `num_of_lens`.**
In simpler terms, `nums` is now a list of integers obtained from the input, while the other variables retain their initial states.
