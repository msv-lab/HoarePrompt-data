Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; if `cnt` is equal to 2, `res` is updated to `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; otherwise, `res` remains 0. `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`.***
