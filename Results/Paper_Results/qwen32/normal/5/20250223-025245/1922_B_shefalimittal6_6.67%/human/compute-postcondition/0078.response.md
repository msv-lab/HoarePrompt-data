The code snippet updates the count of the element `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Specifically, it increments the count of `x` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `len(nums) - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is updated such that the count of `x` is incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `res` is updated to the accumulated sum based on the counts in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the next element in `nums`.**
