Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` equals the length of `nums`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, where the value is the count of a unique integer in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is updated based on the previous `cnt` value if `cnt` was greater than or equal to 2, and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` was indeed greater than or equal to 2; `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens` that has not been iterated over; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the new `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, no additional updates are made to `res`.**
