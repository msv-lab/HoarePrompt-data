The code appends the value of `k + 1` to the list `nums`. The initial state specifies that `nums` is a predefined list of powers of 2 up to `4194304`, followed by `k - 4194304`. After the append operation, the new element `k + 1` is added to the end of this list. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `idx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is less than 16777216, `nums` is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, `k - 4194304`, `k + 1`], `idx` is 23.**
