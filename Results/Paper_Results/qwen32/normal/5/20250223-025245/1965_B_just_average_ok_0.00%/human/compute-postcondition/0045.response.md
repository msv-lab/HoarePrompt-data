The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state where `idx` is 2, after the execution of `idx += 1`, `idx` becomes 3. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` must be at least 4; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]; `idx` is 3.**
