The code appends a new value to the list `nums`. The new value is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `idx` remain unchanged except for the modification to `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`]; `idx` is the largest integer such that 2^idx <= k and idx <= 24, decremented by 1.**
