To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and understand how the `nums` list is constructed.

1. **Variables and Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
   - `nums` is a list constructed based on the value of `k` and the powers of 2 up to \(2^{24}\).
   - `idx` is the largest integer such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\) and \(\text{idx} \leq 24\), decremented by 1.

2. **Constructing the `nums` List:**
   - The list `nums` starts with the sequence: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608].
   - The element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from this sequence.
   - Additional elements \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\) are appended to the list.

3. **Determining the Length of `nums`:**
   - The initial list contains 25 elements (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{24}\)).
   - One element is removed, so the list has 24 elements left.
   - Three additional elements are appended, so the final list has \(24 + 3 = 27\) elements.

Given this understanding, the length of `nums` will always be 27 regardless of the specific values of `k` and `idx` within the given constraints.

Output: **27**
