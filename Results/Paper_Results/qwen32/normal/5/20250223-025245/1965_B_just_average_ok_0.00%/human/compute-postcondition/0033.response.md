Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + 2`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
nums.remove(1 << idx)
```

This line of code removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. The expression `1 << idx` computes 2 raised to the power of `idx` (since left shift by `idx` bits is equivalent to multiplying 1 by 2^`idx`).

Given the initial state, `nums` contains powers of 2 from 1 to 8388608. The value `1 << idx` will be one of these powers of 2, and it will be removed from `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + 2]` with the element `1 << idx` removed.**

In simpler terms, the list `nums` will no longer contain the element `2^idx`. All other variables remain unchanged.
