The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. Initially, `idx` is 1, so after the execution, `idx` becomes 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` must be at least 2, `nums` is a list of integers [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608], `idx` is 2**
