To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `k` and `idx`. The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to `2^idx`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `nums` is a predefined list of powers of 2.
- `idx` is 1.

For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << idx`, which translates to `k >= 2^idx`. Since `idx` is 1, `k` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is at least 2. No other variables need to be adjusted as per the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` must be at least 2; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]; `idx` is 1**
