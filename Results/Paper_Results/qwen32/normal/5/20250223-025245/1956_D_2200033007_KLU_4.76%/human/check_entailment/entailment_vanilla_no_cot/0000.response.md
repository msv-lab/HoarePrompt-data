Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem based on the given problem description and examples. The program only handles two specific cases (when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2) and prints hardcoded values, which do not correspond to the correct maximum sum for all possible inputs.

To solve the problem, the program would need to:

1. Calculate the MEX for different segments of the array.
2. Perform operations to maximize the sum of the array.
3. Track the number of operations performed and ensure it does not exceed the limit.

The current implementation does not perform any of these steps and thus is incorrect.
