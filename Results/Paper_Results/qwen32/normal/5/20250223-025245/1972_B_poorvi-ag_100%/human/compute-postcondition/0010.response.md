The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", `arr` is an input string. If the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd, `results` is `['yes']`. If the count of 'U' in `arr` is even, `results` is `['no']`.**
