Output State: **`results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the respective input string is odd or even.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `results` will be a list where each element corresponds to one of the test cases. The element will be 'yes' if the number of 'U' characters in the input string for that test case is odd, and 'no' if it is even.
