The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the existing value of `n` (which was an integer between 1 and 100) will be overwritten by the new input value. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", `results` is an empty list.**
