The code snippet assigns the input value to the variable `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", `results` is an empty list, `arr` is an input string.**
