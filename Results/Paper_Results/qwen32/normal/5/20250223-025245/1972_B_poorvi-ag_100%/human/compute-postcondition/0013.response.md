The code appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. Therefore, the list `results` will now contain two elements: `'yes'` and `'yes'` if the original count of 'U' in `arr` was odd, or `'no'` and `'yes'` if the original count of 'U' in `arr` was even. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, If the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is odd, `results` is `['yes', 'yes']`. If the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is even, `results` is `['no', 'yes']`.**
