In the given task, the for loop iterates over the `results` list. The loop will execute if the `results` list contains at least one element. The state of `results` before the loop starts needs to be such that it ensures the loop can execute.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in results:
    # the loop body is omit
```
The only variable in the loop head is `i`, but the list `results` is what determines whether the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `results` contains at least one element.

### Task Answer:
State: **`results` is a list containing at least one element, which is either 'yes' or 'no'**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
