The code snippet `arr = input()` takes a new input string and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `results`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string. If the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is odd, `results` is `['yes', 'yes']`. If the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is even, `results` is `['no', 'no']`.**

Note: The count of 'U' in the original `arr` is not affected by the new input string, so the condition for `results` is based on the original `arr` before the new input.
