Output State: **`results` is a list containing all the elements that have been processed, with each element being either 'yes' or 'no', representing whether the count of 'U' in the respective input string is odd or even.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will have been fully printed, with each entry indicating whether the count of 'U' in each corresponding input string was odd ('yes') or even ('no').
