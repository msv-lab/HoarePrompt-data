The code snippet `window_freq = Counter(a[:m])` creates a new `Counter` object named `window_freq` that counts the frequency of each element in the first `m` elements of the list `a`. This does not affect the initial state of `a`, `b`, `k`, `good_subarrays`, or `b_freq`. The only new variable introduced is `window_freq`, which holds the frequency of the first `m` elements of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m, and each element in `a` and `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; `good_subarrays` is 0; `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the list `b`; `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first m elements of `a`.**
