a is a list of strings representing the field, where each string contains pairs of characters separated by spaces, and b is a list of strings representing the actions. The field has dimensions N x M (3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd), and contains unique entities such as players (R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9), goals (RG, BG), and the Quaffle (.Q). The number of players per team is between 1 and 10. The actions list contains T lines (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000), each describing a valid action performed by an entity on the field.
