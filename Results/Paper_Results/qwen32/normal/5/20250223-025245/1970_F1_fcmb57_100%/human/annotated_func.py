#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of strings representing the field, where each string contains pairs of characters separated by spaces, and b is a list of strings representing the actions. The field has dimensions N x M (3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd), and contains unique entities such as players (R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9), goals (RG, BG), and the Quaffle (.Q). The number of players per team is between 1 and 10. The actions list contains T lines (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000), each describing a valid action performed by an entity on the field.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple where the first element is the concatenation of 'x' and 'dx', and the second element is the concatenation of 'y' and 'dy'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is expected to be a tuple of strings, and `b`, which is also expected to be a tuple of strings. It returns a tuple where the first element is the concatenation of the first elements of `a` and `b`, and the second element is the concatenation of the second elements of `a` and `b`.
