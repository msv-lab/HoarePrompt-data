Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is expected to be a tuple of strings, and `b`, which is also expected to be a tuple of strings. It returns a tuple where the first element is the concatenation of the first elements of `a` and `b`, and the second element is the concatenation of the second elements of `a` and `b`.**
