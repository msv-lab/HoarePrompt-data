### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the program correctly implements the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the dimensions of the field (N and M) correctly.
   - It then reads the field configuration, storing the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - The dictionary `players` stores the positions of all players.
   - The list `goals` stores the positions of the goals for each team.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program reads the number of moves and processes each move.
   - For each move, it checks if the action is a movement ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). If so, it updates the position of the entity using the `func_1` function.
   - If the action is 'T' (throw), it checks if the player is at a goal of the opposite team. If so, it increments the score for that team and prints the event.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function summary provided is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to accept two tuples of integers representing coordinates and return a new tuple with the coordinates updated based on the movement.
   - The correct behavior of `func_1` is to sum the corresponding elements of the tuples, not concatenate them. This is consistent with the code, which correctly implements the movement logic.

4. **Handling Goal Scoring:**
   - The program checks if the player's position is in the goals list for the opposite team using the `in` keyword, which checks for tuple equality. This is correct.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, which should result in a point for the other team. This is a critical oversight and means the program does not fully meet the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identifies the critical oversight in the program: the lack of handling for the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal. This is indeed a significant error that affects the correctness of the program.

Thus, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
