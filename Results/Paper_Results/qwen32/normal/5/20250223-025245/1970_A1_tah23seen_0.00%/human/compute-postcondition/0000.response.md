Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the string `s`. The precondition that `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence and its length does not exceed 500,000 remains unchanged.
