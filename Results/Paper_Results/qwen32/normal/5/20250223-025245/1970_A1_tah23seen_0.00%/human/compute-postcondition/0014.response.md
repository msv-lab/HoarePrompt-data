To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and how the variables `i` and `s` (which determines the length of the loop) are involved.

Given:
- `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `ans` is an empty string.
- `d` is a dictionary with keys `0` and `1`, and possibly `i + 1`.
- `d[0]` is `0`.
- `d[1]` is `1` if `s[1]` is "(", otherwise `-1`.
- If `s[1]` is ")", `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] - 1`.
- `i` is 1.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(len(s)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 because the `for` loop in Python automatically increments the loop variable by 1 after each iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be 2.
- `s` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop head.
- `n` remains the same as it is the length of `s`.
- `ans` remains the same as it is not mentioned to be modified by the loop head.
- `d` remains the same as it is not mentioned to be modified by the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys `0` and `1`, and possibly `i + 1`. `d[0]` is `0`, `d[1]` is `1` if `s[1]` is "(", otherwise `-1`. If `s[1]` is ")", `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] - 1`. `i` is 2**
