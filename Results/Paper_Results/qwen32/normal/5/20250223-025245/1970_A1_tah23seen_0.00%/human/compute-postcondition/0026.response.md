The code `ans += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the existing string `ans`. This means that the new value of `ans` will be the concatenation of its previous value and the character `s[i]`. 

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `d`, `j`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is the string `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[i_next] + s[i]`; `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses; `i` and `j` are the next tuple from the list `d`.**
