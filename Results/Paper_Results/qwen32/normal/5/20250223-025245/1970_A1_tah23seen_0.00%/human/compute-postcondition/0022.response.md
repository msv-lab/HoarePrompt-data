The code snippet `ans += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the string `ans`. 

Initial State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses.

After executing `ans += s[i]`, the string `ans` will now include the character at index `i` of `s`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `d`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is the string `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[i]`; `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses.**
