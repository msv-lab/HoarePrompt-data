To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `i` and `j`. The loop iterates over the list `d`, which contains tuples of `(i, j)` values. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `ans` is the string `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[i_next]`.
- `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses.
- `i` is `i_next`.
- `j` is `j_next`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` and `j` were set to `i_next` and `j_next` respectively. For the next iteration, the loop will take the next tuple `(i, j)` from the list `d`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be the next tuple `(i, j)` from the list `d`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is the string `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[i_next]`; `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses; `i` and `j` are the next tuple from the list `d`.**
