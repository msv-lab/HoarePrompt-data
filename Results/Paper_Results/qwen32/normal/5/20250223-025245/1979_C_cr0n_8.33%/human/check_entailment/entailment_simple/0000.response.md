### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem described. Let's break down the logic to see if it correctly addresses the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`N`) and the list of multipliers (`vals`).

2. **Product Calculation**:
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).

3. **Bet Calculation**:
   - It computes a list `vprod` where each element is the integer division of `prod` by the corresponding multiplier in `vals`.
   - It then calculates `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`. This is the remaining amount after distributing the bets as calculated in `vprod`.

4. **Validation**:
   - If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to distribute the bets in a way that guarantees a profit for any outcome.
   - Otherwise, it prints the list `vprod` as the bets.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The approach is based on the idea that if we can distribute the bets such that the total bet (`sum(vprod)`) is strictly less than the return for each possible winning outcome (`k_i * vprod[i]`), then we have a valid solution.
  - Since `prod` is the product of all `k_i`, `prod // k_i` ensures that `k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod`, which is greater than the total bet (`sum(vprod)`).
  - The condition `den > 0` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return for each outcome, making the solution valid.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles cases where it's impossible to distribute the bets to guarantee a profit (e.g., when all `k_i` are equal, leading to `den <= 0`).

- **Output**:
  - The program outputs the correct format for valid solutions and `-1` for invalid cases.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described. It handles the input parsing, product calculation, bet distribution, and validation appropriately.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
