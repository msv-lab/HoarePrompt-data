The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `vals`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, and `k` are already defined, and `N` is an input integer. The code does not affect `t`, `n`, `k`, or `N`; it only introduces a new variable `vals`.

Given the initial state and the code, the output state will include the newly created list `vals` containing integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20; `N` is an input integer; `vals` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
