Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to distribute the bets on `n` outcomes such that for each outcome `i`, if it wins, the amount received back (`k_i * x_i`) is strictly greater than the total amount bet on all outcomes (`sum(x_j) for all j`). The program should output the bets `x_i` or `-1` if no such distribution is possible.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculating Product:**
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod = k_1 * k_2 * ... * k_n`.

3. **Calculating `vprod`:**
   - For each outcome `i`, it calculates `vprod[i] = prod / k_i`. This essentially means `vprod[i]` is the product of all multipliers except `k_i`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - It calculates `den = prod - sum(vprod)`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod` as the bets.

### Correctness Check
To verify the correctness, let's consider the conditions:
- For each outcome `i`, the amount received back if it wins should be `k_i * x_i`.
- The total amount bet should be `sum(x_j) for all j`.
- The condition to satisfy is `k_i * x_i > sum(x_j) for all j`.

Let's see if the program satisfies this condition:
- The program sets `x_i = vprod[i] = prod / k_i`.
- The total amount bet is `sum(vprod)`.
- The amount received back if outcome `i` wins is `k_i * vprod[i] = k_i * (prod / k_i) = prod`.

So, the condition becomes:
- `prod > sum(vprod)`.

This is exactly what the program checks with `den = prod - sum(vprod)`. If `den > 0`, then `prod > sum(vprod)` and the condition is satisfied.

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the bets such that the condition is satisfied if possible. If not, it correctly outputs `-1`.

Therefore, **Correctness: True**.
