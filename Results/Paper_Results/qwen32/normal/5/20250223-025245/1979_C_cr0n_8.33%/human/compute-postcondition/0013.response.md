Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, the task is to determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

Here is a breakdown of the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (number of test cases).
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 (number of elements in the list `k`).
  - `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20.
  - `N` is an input integer.
  - `vals` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have at least `N` elements.
  - `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`.
  - `vprod` is a list where each element is the integer division of `prod` by the corresponding element in `vals`.
  - `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)` and the current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(-1)
```

From the code snippet, it is clear that the `print` statement will output `-1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `N`, `vals`, `prod`, `vprod`, or `den`.

Therefore, the output of the code is:
Output: **-1**
