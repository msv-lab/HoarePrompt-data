Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input provided by the user, `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each input in the list `a`, `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each input in the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`. Either the length of the set of characters in `a[0]` is not 1, or the length of the set of characters in `a[-1]` is not 1, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`**
