The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the existing value of `first_row`. 

Given that `first_row` initially holds the first character of the newly appended input and `a[-1][0]` is the first character of the last item in the list `a` (which is the newly appended input), the new value of `first_row` will be the concatenation of its initial value and the first character of the newly appended input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list containing `input_value` and the newly appended input, `first_row` is the concatenation of its initial value and the first character of the newly appended input, `last_row` is the last character of the newly appended input, `i` is 1.**
