The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i` are all defined in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
