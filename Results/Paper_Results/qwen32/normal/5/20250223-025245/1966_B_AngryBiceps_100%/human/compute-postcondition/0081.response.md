Output State: **The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, each determining if a grid of `n` by `m` size, with characters 'W' or 'B', meets the specified conditions. For each test case, the program checks if the first and last rows of the grid are composed of the same character and are different from each other, or if the first and last columns of the grid are composed of the same character and are different from each other. If either of these conditions is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the program will have evaluated each of the `t` test cases. For each test case, it checks if the first and last rows or the first and last columns of the grid are uniform and different. If they are, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.
