The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `first_row`. 

Given that `first_row` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `first_row` will contain the first character of the last element of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list containing `input_value`, `first_row` is the first character of the last element of `a`, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0**.
