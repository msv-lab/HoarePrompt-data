Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n-1`. If the first and last elements of `a` each consist of a single repeated character and are not equal, the condition in the if statement is satisfied. Otherwise, either the first or last element of `a` does not consist of a single repeated character, or they are equal. Additionally, either the set of characters in `first_row` is not a single character, the set of characters in `last_row` is not a single character, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`. Another input is about to be processed for the next iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input value, `first_row` is the first character of the input value, `last_row` is the last character of the input value, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the input values, `first_row` is the first character of the first input value concatenated with the first character of the second input value, `last_row` is the last character of the first input value concatenated with the last character of the second input value, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing three elements which are the input values, `first_row` is the first character of the first input value concatenated with the first character of the second input value and the first character of the third input value, `last_row` is the last character of the first input value concatenated with the last character of the second input value and the last character of the third input value, `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
