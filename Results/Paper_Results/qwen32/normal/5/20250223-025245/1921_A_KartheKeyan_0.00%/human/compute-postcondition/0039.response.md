Output State: **`n` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `coord` is a sorted list with 8 elements, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

In natural language, the value of `n` has been decreased by 1 while the values of `coord`, `res`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.
