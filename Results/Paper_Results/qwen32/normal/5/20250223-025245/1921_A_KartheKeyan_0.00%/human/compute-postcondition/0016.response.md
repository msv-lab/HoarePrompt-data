The code calculates the squared distance between the first two points in the `coord` list and assigns it to `p1`. The values of `n`, `coord`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `coord` is a sorted list of tuples `((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4))` based on ascending x and then y values, `res` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`.**
