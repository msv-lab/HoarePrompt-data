The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is a list with at least 7 elements (the original 5 elements plus the appended `(x, y)`), `res` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `x` and `y` are the new input integers, `i` is 4.
