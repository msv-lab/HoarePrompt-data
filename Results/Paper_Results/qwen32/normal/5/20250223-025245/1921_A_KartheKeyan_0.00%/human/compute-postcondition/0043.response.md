The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range value `4`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range value `4`, which is a constant and does not need adjustment. The loop will execute 4 times regardless of the values of `n`, `coord`, and `res`.

Since the loop will execute regardless of the initial values of `n`, `coord`, and `res`, we only need to ensure that these variables are in a valid state before the loop starts. However, since the task specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head only involves `i` and the range, no adjustments are needed for `n`, `coord`, and `res`.

State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is not yet defined (will be initialized by the loop)**

Since `i` is not defined before the loop starts and will be initialized by the loop itself, we do not need to specify its initial value. The loop will automatically handle the initialization of `i` to 0 and then increment it up to 3.

Final State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0**
