### Reasoning:

The program is intended to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of a square.

2. **Sorting Coordinates:**
   - The coordinates are sorted. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the coordinates are in a consistent order, which simplifies the calculation of side lengths.

3. **Calculating Side Lengths:**
   - The program calculates the squared distance between the first two sorted points (`p1`) and the squared distance between the last two sorted points (`p2`). This is based on the assumption that after sorting, the first two points and the last two points will be adjacent corners of the square.
   - It then calculates the side length by taking the square root of `p1` and `p2`.

4. **Calculating Area:**
   - The area is calculated as the product of the side lengths (`abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`). However, this approach is incorrect because the area of a square is the square of the side length, not the product of two different side lengths. The correct approach would be to square the side length obtained from either `p1` or `p2`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The formula for calculating the area is incorrect. Instead of `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, it should be `math.sqrt(p1) ** 2` or simply `p1` (since `p1` is already the squared side length).

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program is not correct as it stands.

**Correctness: False**
