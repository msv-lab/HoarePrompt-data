Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is a sorted list with 8 elements, `res` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `p1` remains unchanged as it was already defined in the initial state. The value of `p2` is now calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points at indices 3 and 2 in the `coord` list. The values of `n`, `coord`, and `res` remain unchanged.
