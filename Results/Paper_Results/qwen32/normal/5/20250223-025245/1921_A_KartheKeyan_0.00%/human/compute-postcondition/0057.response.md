Let's break down the provided code and state to determine the output of the `print(res)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`n`**: A non-zero value. This variable is mentioned but not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. **`coord`**: A list of four tuples, each representing coordinates `(x, y)`. The list is sorted by the default tuple comparison, which means it is sorted first by the x-values, and then by the y-values if the x-values are the same.
3. **`res`**: This variable is calculated as `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`.
4. **`p1`**: This is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, which is the difference in the x-coordinates of the second and first tuples in `coord`.
5. **`p2`**: This is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, which is the difference in the x-coordinates of the fourth and third tuples in `coord`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Sorting `coord`**: Since `coord` is sorted by the default tuple comparison, the x-values of the tuples in `coord` are in non-decreasing order. For example, if `coord` were `[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8)]`, it would remain the same after sorting because the x-values are already in increasing order.

2. **Calculating `p1`**: 
   - `p1` is the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first tuples in `coord`.
   - For example, if `coord` is `[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8)]`, then `p1 = 3 - 1 = 2`.

3. **Calculating `p2`**: 
   - `p2` is the difference between the x-coordinates of the fourth and third tuples in `coord`.
   - For example, if `coord` is `[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8)]`, then `p2 = 7 - 5 = 2`.

4. **Calculating `res`**:
   - `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`.
   - Continuing the example, `res = abs(math.sqrt(2) * math.sqrt(2)) = abs(2) = 2`.

### Final Output

Since we do not have the exact values of the tuples in `coord`, we can describe `res` in terms of the sorted `coord` list.

**Output**: **res (where res is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the differences in the x-coordinates of the second and first tuples, and the fourth and third tuples in the sorted `coord` list)**
