The loop iterates 4 times, appending a new coordinate `(x, y)` to the list `coord` during each iteration. Given the initial state and the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can deduce the state after all four iterations.

After the fourth iteration, the list `coord` will have 8 elements (the original 4 elements plus the 4 appended `(x, y)` pairs). The variables `n`, `res`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged as per the provided code and the description of the loop's impact.

Here's the final output state:

Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is a list with 8 elements, `res` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `i` is 4.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all four iterations, `coord` will contain 8 coordinates, and the other variables will retain their initial values except for `i`, which will be 4 since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 3`.
