Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 1 (though `n` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `coord` is a sorted list of tuples `((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4))` based on ascending x and then y values.
- `res` is calculated as `abs(math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]))`.
- `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.
- `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(res)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `coord`**: Since `coord` is a sorted list of tuples based on ascending x and then y values, we can assume the following:
   - `coord[0]` will be the tuple with the smallest x value, and if there's a tie, the smallest y value.
   - `coord[1]` will be the next tuple in the sorted order.
   - `coord[2]` will be the next tuple in the sorted order.
   - `coord[3]` will be the tuple with the largest x value, and if there's a tie, the largest y value.

2. **Calculating `p1` and `p2`**:
   - `p1` is the difference in the x-values of the second and first tuples in `coord`, i.e., `coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]`.
   - `p2` is the difference in the x-values of the fourth and third tuples in `coord`, i.e., `coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]`.

3. **Calculating `res`**:
   - `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, i.e., `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`.

### Output Calculation:
Given the sorted nature of `coord`, let's assume the following example values for `coord` to illustrate the calculation:
- `coord = ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8))`

Then:
- `p1 = coord[1][0] - coord[0][0] = 3 - 1 = 2`
- `p2 = coord[3][0] - coord[2][0] = 7 - 5 = 2`
- `res = abs(math.sqrt(2) * math.sqrt(2)) = abs(2) = 2`

However, since the exact values of `coord` are not provided, we will describe `res` in terms of `p1` and `p2`.

### Final Answer:
The `print(res)` statement will print the calculated value of `res`, which is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **res (where res is abs(math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])))**
