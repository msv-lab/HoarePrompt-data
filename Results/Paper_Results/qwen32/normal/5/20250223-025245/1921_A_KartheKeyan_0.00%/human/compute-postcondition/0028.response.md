The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. Given that `x` and `y` were previously defined as the first and second input integers respectively, this line of code will update the values of `x` and `y` based on the new input.

Since the initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are already defined as the first and second input integers, and the code reassigns them based on a new input, the new values of `x` and `y` will be whatever integers are provided in the new input.

The other variables (`n`, `coord`, `res`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is a list with at least 5 elements (the original 4 elements plus the appended `(x, y)`), `res` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `x` and `y` are the new input integers, `i` is 3.**
