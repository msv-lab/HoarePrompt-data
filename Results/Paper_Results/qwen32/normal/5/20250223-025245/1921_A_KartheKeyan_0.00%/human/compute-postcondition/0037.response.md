The code calculates the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, and assigns this value to `res`. The values of `n`, `coord`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The value of `res` is updated to the calculated value.

Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is a sorted list with 8 elements, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**.
