Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `y` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The `coord` list now contains an additional tuple `(x, y)`, making its length three. All other variables remain unchanged.
