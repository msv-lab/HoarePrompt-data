To ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the variable `n` in the loop condition `while n:`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is not zero.

Given the state right before the loop:
- There are `t` test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- For each test case, there are four lines of input, each containing two integers `x_i, y_i` (-1000 ≤ `x_i`, `y_i` ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area.
- The variable `n` holds the value of the integer input provided by the user.

The loop condition `while n:` requires `n` to be a non-zero value for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is not zero.

State right before the loop: `n` must be a non-zero value.

Since the problem doesn't specify the initial value of `n`, we can assume that `n` could be any integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to set `n` to a non-zero value. The simplest choice is to set `n` to 1.

State: **`n` is 1**
