The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to a new variable `m`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is an input integer.**
