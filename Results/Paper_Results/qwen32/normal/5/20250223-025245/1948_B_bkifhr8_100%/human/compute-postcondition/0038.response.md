Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99 and the current integer at index `i` is less than the integer at index `i - 1`; `ans` is `False`; `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. The list `nums` is not sorted.**
