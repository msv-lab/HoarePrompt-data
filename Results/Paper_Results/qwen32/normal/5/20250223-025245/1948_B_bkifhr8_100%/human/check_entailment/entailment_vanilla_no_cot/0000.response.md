Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to sort the array using the described operations. The main issue lies in the logic used to check if the array can be sorted.

The current implementation checks if the array can be sorted by examining each pair of elements from the end to the beginning. If an element is smaller than the previous one, it attempts to split the previous element and checks if the resulting array (including the current element) is sorted. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible ways to apply the operation and does not ensure that the entire array can be sorted through a series of valid operations.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    stack = []
    for num in arr:
        while stack and stack[-1] > num:
            last = stack.pop()
            digits = [int(d) for d in str(last)]
            if len(digits) == 1 or digits[-1] > num:
                return False
            stack.extend(digits[:-1])
            last_digit = digits[-1]
            if last_digit > num:
                return False
        stack.append(num)
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][can_be_sorted(arr)])

func()
```

In this corrected version, we use a stack to simulate the process of splitting numbers and checking if the array can be sorted. We iterate through the array and use the stack to keep track of the numbers. If we encounter a number that is smaller than the last number in the stack, we split the last number and check if the resulting sequence can still be sorted. If at any point we cannot maintain the sorted order, we return `False`. Otherwise, we return `True`.
