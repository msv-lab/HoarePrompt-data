Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is the new input integer and must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is False, `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.** 

The variable `ans` has been set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values.
