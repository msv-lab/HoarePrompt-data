The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`, `i` starts from `m - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is decreased by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1 (since it gets decremented at the start of the next iteration).

Let's break it down:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was decreased by 1.
2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be set to the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
3. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than 0.

So, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be set to 3 at the start of the next iteration. This pattern continues until `i` reaches 1, at which point the loop will execute one last time and then terminate.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input line where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99; `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.
