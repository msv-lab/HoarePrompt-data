Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is the new input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]` and `ans` is set to False if `nums` (which consists of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`) is not sorted. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.**
