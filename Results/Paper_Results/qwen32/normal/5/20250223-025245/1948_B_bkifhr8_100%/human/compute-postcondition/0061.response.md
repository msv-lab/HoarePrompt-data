The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of those elements to an integer, and then stores them in the list `arr`. This means that `arr` will now hold the integers provided in the input, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is the new input integer; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `ans` is a boolean that is `True` unless the loop found a pair `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` such that the concatenated list `nums` was not sorted, in which case `ans` is `False`**.
