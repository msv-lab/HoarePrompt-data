Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the number of moves `n` is greater than or equal to the number of cubes `m` required in the final tower. However, this approach is not entirely correct. 

To determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to consider that each move can either add or remove one cube. Therefore, the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` must be even. This is because adding and removing cubes in pairs will result in a net change of zero cubes, and any remaining moves must result in a net change that is an even number of cubes.

For example:
- If `n = 5` and `m = 3`, it is possible: three moves to add cubes, and two moves to remove cubes (or vice versa).
- If `n = 2` and `m = 4`, it is not possible: there are not enough moves to add four cubes without removing any, and any removal would result in fewer than four cubes.

The current implementation of `func_1()` only checks if `n >= m`, which is not sufficient to determine the possibility of building the tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. It fails to account for the requirement that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
