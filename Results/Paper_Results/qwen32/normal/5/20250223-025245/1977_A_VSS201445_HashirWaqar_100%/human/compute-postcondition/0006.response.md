Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input function. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, then `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even. Otherwise, either `n` is less than `m` or the difference between `n` and `m` is not even.**
