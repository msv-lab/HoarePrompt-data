### Reasoning:

Let's evaluate the program against the problem description and the annotations provided.

#### Problem Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly 1 cube per move.
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- For each test case, output "Yes" if possible, "No" otherwise.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Annotations:
The annotations indicate that the program iterates over `t` test cases, reads `n` and `m` for each test case, and prints "YES" if `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, otherwise "NO".

#### Analysis:

1. **Condition `n >= m`:**
   - This checks if the number of moves `n` is at least as many as the number of cubes `m` desired in the final tower.
   - This is necessary because if `n < m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves since each move can only add or remove one cube.

2. **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`:**
   - This checks if the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` is even.
   - This is correct because each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (an odd number). To end up with an exact number of cubes `m` after `n` moves, the net additions (or removals) must be even.

#### Original Assessment's Concerns:

The original assessment suggests that the program does not handle the case where `n < m` correctly. However, let's re-evaluate this:

- **Case `n < m`:**
  - If `n < m`, it means we need more moves than the current number of cubes to reach `m` cubes.
  - The condition `n >= m` will fail, and the program will print "NO".
  - This is correct because with fewer moves than cubes, it is impossible to reach the desired number of cubes `m` by only adding or removing one cube per move.

However, the original assessment also mentions that the logic `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is not applicable when `n < m`. This is true, but the program correctly handles this by simply checking `n >= m` first and then `(n - m) % 2 == 0` only if `n >= m`.

#### Correctness:

The program correctly handles all cases:
- If `n < m`, it correctly outputs "NO" because it is impossible to reach `m` cubes with fewer moves.
- If `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, it correctly outputs "YES".
- If `n >= m` but `(n - m) % 2 != 0`, it correctly outputs "NO".

Therefore, the original assessment's concern about the missing edge case is not valid because the program already handles it correctly by the initial condition `n >= m`.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correct.

**Final: True**
