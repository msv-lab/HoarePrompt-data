Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 100) representing the number of test cases. For each of the following `t` lines, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 100). The function returns a result for each pair of `n` and `m`, but the specific nature of the result is not detailed in the provided information.**
