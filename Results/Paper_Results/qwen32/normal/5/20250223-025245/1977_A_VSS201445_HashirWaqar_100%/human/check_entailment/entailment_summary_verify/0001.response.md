Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis

Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. The goal is to determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, starting from 0 cubes.

### Key Observations

1. **Net Effect of Moves**: Each move changes the number of cubes by Â±1. Therefore, the net effect of `n` moves can be any integer between `-n` and `n`.
2. **Parity Condition**: To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the net effect must be `m`. Since each move changes the count by 1, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because the net effect of pairs of moves (one add and one remove) is zero, and any remaining moves must either all be adds or all be removes to reach `m`.
3. **Feasibility Condition**: Since we start from 0 cubes and can't have a negative number of cubes, `n` must be at least `m`. This is because we can't remove more cubes than we have.

### Code Analysis

The provided code checks two conditions:
- `n >= m`: This ensures that we can't end up with more cubes than the number of moves.
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the final number of cubes is even, which is necessary for the feasibility of reaching `m` cubes.

### Function Summary Validation

The function summary correctly describes the logic of the code:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It prints 'YES' if `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Original Assessment Validation

The original assessment is accurate:
- The condition `n >= m` ensures that we do not attempt to remove more cubes than we have.
- The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the net effect of the moves is achievable.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
