Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input function.**

In this output state, `t` retains its initial value as an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The variables `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values provided by the input function, which splits the input into two parts and converts them to integers.
