Let's analyze the given program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly 1 cube per move.
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- For each test case, output "Yes" if possible, "No" otherwise.

### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `n >= m`:** 
   - This condition checks if the number of moves `n` is at least as many as the number of cubes `m` we want in the final tower. This is necessary because if `n < m`, we can't possibly have `m` cubes after `n` moves since we can only add or remove one cube at a time.
   - **Correctness:** This part of the condition is correct.

2. **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`:**
   - This condition checks if the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` is even. This is necessary because adding or removing one cube changes the number of cubes by 1, which is an odd number. To end up with an exact number of cubes `m` after `n` moves, the number of "net additions" (or removals) must be even.
   - **Correctness:** This part of the condition is also correct.

However, there is a missing edge case in the provided program:
- The program does not account for the scenario where `n < m`. Although the condition `n >= m` handles this, the logic `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is not applicable in this case. When `n < m`, the only way to have `m` cubes is if `n` is large enough to make up the difference, but the logic should handle this directly.

### Correctness Check:
- The program handles the cases where `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` correctly.
- However, the program should handle the case where `n < m` separately. If `n < m`, the program should check if `(m - n) % 2 == 0` to determine if it is possible to reach `m` cubes by adding cubes.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the test case:
- Input: `1\n3 1`
- Expected Output: `Yes` (Nikita can add 1 cube and then remove 2 cubes to end up with 1 cube after 3 moves).
- Actual Output: `NO` (The program incorrectly outputs `NO` because `n < m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is not checked).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `n < m` correctly.

**Correctness: False**. 

The program should be modified to handle the case where `n < m` by checking if `(m - n) % 2 == 0`.
