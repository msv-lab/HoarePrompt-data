The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers where `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and the difference between `n` and `m` is even.

Since the `print` statement is `print('YES')`, it will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`.

Output: **YES**
