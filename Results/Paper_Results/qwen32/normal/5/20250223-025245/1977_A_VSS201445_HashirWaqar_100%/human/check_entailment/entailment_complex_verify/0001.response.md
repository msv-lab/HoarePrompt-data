### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description, the program code, and the annotations to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move either adds or removes exactly 1 cube.
- **Key Insight**: 
  - Each move changes the number of cubes by ±1.
  - To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the net change in the number of cubes must be `m` (starting from 0 cubes).
  - The net change can only be achieved if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because the sum of an even number of ±1 changes can result in any even number.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
  - **Condition `n >= m`**: This ensures that the number of moves `n` is sufficient to reach `m` cubes, considering that each move can only add or remove one cube.
  - **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This ensures that the net change required to reach `m` cubes from 0 cubes is achievable with an even number of moves.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the program's state at key points, confirming that the program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It then checks the conditions and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions specified.

#### Validation:
- The annotations confirm that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem analysis.
- The condition `n >= m` ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach `m` cubes.
- The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the net change is achievable with the given number of moves.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly checks the necessary conditions to determine if it is possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
