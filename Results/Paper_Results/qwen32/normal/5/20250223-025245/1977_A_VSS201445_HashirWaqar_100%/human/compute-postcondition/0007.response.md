The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop runs for a number of iterations specified by `int(input())`. This means the state we need to adjust is the value that `int(input())` will return in the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input function.
- The condition about `n` and `m` does not affect the loop control directly, as the loop is controlled by the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used, the state we need to adjust is the next input that will be read by `int(input())`. If the loop has executed `k` times so far, then `int(input())` should return a value that is at least 1 more than `k` for the loop to execute one more time.

However, since we do not have the exact number of iterations that have occurred so far, we can only describe the state in terms of the next input required for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input function, and the next input to `int(input())` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time.**
