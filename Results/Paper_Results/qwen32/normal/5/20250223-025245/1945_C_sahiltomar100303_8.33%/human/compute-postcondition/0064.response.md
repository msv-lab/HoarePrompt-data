Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is 2; `s` is "00"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 1; `i` is 2; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; if the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is 0 and `leftOne` is 0 and `rightZero` is 2; otherwise, `leftZero` is 1 and `leftOne` is -1 and `rightOne` is 1.**
