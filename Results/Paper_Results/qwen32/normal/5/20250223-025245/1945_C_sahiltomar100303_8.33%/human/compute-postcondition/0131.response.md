Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is 2; `s` is "00"; `mid` is 1; `left` can be 0 or not 0; `i` is 2; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; `leftZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `right` is 2. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is not 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, then `tleftZero` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the condition does not affect the variables further. If `left` is not 0 and `right` is not equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `mid` and `left` is either less than or equal to the absolute difference between `mid` and `right`, or greater than the absolute difference between `mid` and `right`.**
