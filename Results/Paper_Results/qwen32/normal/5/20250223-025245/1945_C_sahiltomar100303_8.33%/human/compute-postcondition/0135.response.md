The code snippet `mid = n // 2` calculates the integer division of `n` by 2 and assigns the result to the variable `mid`. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`.**
