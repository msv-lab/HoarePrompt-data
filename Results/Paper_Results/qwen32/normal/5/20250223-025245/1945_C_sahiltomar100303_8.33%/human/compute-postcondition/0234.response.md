Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the final count of '0's in the first half of `s` after the loop; `rightZero` is the final count of '0's in the second half of `s` after the loop; `leftOne` is the final count of '1's in the first half of `s` after the loop; `rightOne` is the final count of '1's in the second half of `s` after the loop; `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`. If `s[right] == '0'`, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is decremented by 1. If `s[right] != '0'`, `trightOne` is decremented by 1 and `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. `left` is `0`; `leftMove` is `0`; `right` is `n // 2 + 2`.**
