The code increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `0`; `rightZero` is `2`; `leftOne` is `0`; `rightOne` is `0`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is `1`; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is `0`. The current character `s[i]` is '0'.**
