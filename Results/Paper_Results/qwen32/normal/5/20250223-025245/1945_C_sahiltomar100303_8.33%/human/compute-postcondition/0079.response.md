Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is 2; `s` is "00"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 0; `i` is 2; `leftMove` is 0; `trightZero` is 1; `trightOne` is 0; `leftZero` is either -1 or -2; `leftOne` is either 0 or -1; `rightZero` is either 2, 3, or 4; `rightOne` is either 0, 1, or 2`. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `rightZero` is either 3 or 4 and `leftZero` is -2. Otherwise, `rightOne` is either 1 or 2 and `leftOne` is -2.**

Explanation: The value of `left` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
