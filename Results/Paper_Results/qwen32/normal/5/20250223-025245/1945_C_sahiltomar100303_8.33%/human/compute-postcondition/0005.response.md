The code snippet provided initializes the variable `leftZero` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `mid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input from the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0.**
