Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` must be greater than 1; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `-1` if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is `0`; `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the count of '0's in the second half of `s`; `leftOne` is `0` if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`; `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus 1 and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the count of '0's in the second half of `s`; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is not '0', otherwise it remains the count of '1's in the second half of `s`; `left` is `n // 2`; `leftMove` is `0`.**
