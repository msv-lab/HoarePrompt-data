Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `mid`. If `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` is increased by 1 and `tleftZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is increased by 1 and `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**
