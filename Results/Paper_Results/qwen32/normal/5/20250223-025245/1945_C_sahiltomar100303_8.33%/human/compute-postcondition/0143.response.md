The code snippet `trightOne = 0` sets the value of `trightOne` to `0`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State remains the same for all other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `0`; `rightZero` is `0`; `leftOne` is `0`; `rightOne` is `0`; `tleftZero` is `0`; `trightZero` is `0`; `tleftOne` is `0`; `trightOne` is `0`.**
