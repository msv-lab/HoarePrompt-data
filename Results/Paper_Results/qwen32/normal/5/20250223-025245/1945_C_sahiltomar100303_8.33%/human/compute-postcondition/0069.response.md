The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state where `leftOne` is 0, this operation will result in `leftOne` being -1. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is 2; `s` is "00"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 1; `i` is 2; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is 2; `trightZero` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; `leftZero` is 0; `leftOne` is -1**.
