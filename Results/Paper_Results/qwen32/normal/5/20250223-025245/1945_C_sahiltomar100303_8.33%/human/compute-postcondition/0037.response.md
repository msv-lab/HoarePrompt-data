Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is the string input from the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`; `rightZero` is 2; `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the first half of `s`; `trightZero` is 1; `tleftOne` is the number of '1's in the first half of `s`; `trightOne` is 0; `i` is `mid`; the current character at position `i` in `s` is '0'.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `rightZero` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
