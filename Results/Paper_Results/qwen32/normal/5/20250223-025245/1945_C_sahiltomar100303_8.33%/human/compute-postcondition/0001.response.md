In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0**
