The only variables in the loop head of the provided `for` loop are `i` and `mid`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

From the given information:
- The loop condition is `for i in range(mid)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid`.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `mid`.

Since `i` is currently `mid` after the last iteration, the loop will not execute again with this value of `i`. Therefore, to simulate the start of a new iteration, we need to set `i` to the next value it would take if the loop were to continue, which is `0` (the starting value of `i` in the loop).

`mid` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `0`.**
