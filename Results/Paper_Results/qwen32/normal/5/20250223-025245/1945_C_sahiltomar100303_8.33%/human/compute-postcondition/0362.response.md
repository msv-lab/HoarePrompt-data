Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t`; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2`; `rightZero` is adjusted based on the characters moved, minus 1 if the character at position `right` in `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is adjusted such that `leftOne` is consistent with `leftZero`; `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2`; `tleftZero` is adjusted such that `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2`; `trightZero` is the count of '0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1`, minus 1 if the character at position `right` in `s` is '0'; `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`, plus 1 if the character at position `right` in `s` is not '0', plus 1; `trightOne` is adjusted such that `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2`; `left` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is adjusted such that `right < n` and `right` is now `right - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `tleftOne` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values.
