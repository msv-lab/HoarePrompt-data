Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `0`; `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s`; `leftOne` is `0`; `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s`; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s`; `left` is `n // 2`; `leftMove` is `0`.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` must be greater than 1; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `-1` if the character at position `left - 2` in `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is `0`; `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if the character at position `left - 2` in `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the count of '0's in the second half of `s`; `leftOne` is `0` if the character at position `left - 2` in `s` is '0', otherwise `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`; `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus 1 and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if the character at position `left - 2` in `s` is '0', otherwise it remains the count of '0's in the second half of `s`; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if the character at position `left - 2` in `s` is not '0', otherwise it remains the count of '1's in the second half of `s`; `left` is `n // 2 - 1`; `leftMove` is `0`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` must be greater than 2; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `-2` if the character at position `left - 2` in `s` is '0' and `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is `-1` if `s[left - 2]` is '0' or `0` if `s[left - 2]` is not '0'; `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 2 if `s[left - 2]` is '0' and `s[left - 1]` is '0', plus 1 if only `s[left - 2]` is '0', otherwise it remains the count of '0's in the second half of `s`; `leftOne` is `0` if `s[left - 2]` is '0', otherwise `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`; `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if `s[left - 2]` is '0' or `s[left - 1]` is not '0', plus 2 if `s[left - 2]` is not '0' and `s[left - 1]` is '0', and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 2 if `s[left - 2]` is '0' and `s[left - 1]` is '0', plus 1 if only `s[left - 2]` is '0', otherwise it remains the count of '0's in the second half of `s`; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if `s[left - 2]` is not '0' or `s[left - 1]` is not '0', plus 2 if `s[left - 2]` is not '0' and `s[left - 1]` is '0', and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`; `left` is `n // 2 - 2` and `left` must be greater than 0; `leftMove` is `0`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is `-3` if `s[left - 3]` and `s[left - 2]` are both '0', `-2` if only `s[left - 3]` is '0', and `-1` if `s[left - 3]` is not '0'. `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 3 if both `s[left - 3]` and `s[left - 2]` are '0', plus 2 if only `s[left - 3]` is '0', plus 1 if `s[left - 2]` is '0', and the original count otherwise. `leftOne` is `0` if `s[left - 3]` is '0', and `leftOne - 1` otherwise. `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if `s[left - 3]` is '0' or `s[left - 2]` is not '0', plus 2 if both `s[left - 3]` and `s[left - 2]` are not '0', and must be less than `(n - left + 2) // 2`. `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus the same adjustments as `rightZero`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus the same adjustments as `rightOne`, and must be less than `(n - left + 2) // 2`. `left` is `n // 2 - 3` and must be greater than 0, `leftMove` is `0`, and `rightOne` must be less than `(n // 2 + 4) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
