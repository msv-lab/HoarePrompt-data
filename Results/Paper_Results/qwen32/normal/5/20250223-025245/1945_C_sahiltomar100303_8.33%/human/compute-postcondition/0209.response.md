Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is `-3` if `s[left - 2]` and `s[left - 1]` are both '0', `-2` if only `s[left - 2]` is '0', and `-1` if `s[left - 2]` is not '0'. `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 3 if both `s[left - 2]` and `s[left - 1]` are '0', plus 2 if only `s[left - 2]` is '0', plus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', and the original count otherwise. `leftOne` is `0` if `s[left - 2]` is '0', and `leftOne - 1` otherwise. `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus 1 if `s[left - 2]` is '0' or `s[left - 1]` is not '0', plus 2 if both `s[left - 2]` and `s[left - 1]` are not '0', and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`. `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` plus the same adjustments as `rightZero`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` plus the same adjustments as `rightOne`, and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`. `left` is `n // 2 - 2` and must be greater than 0, `leftMove` is `0`, and `rightOne` must be less than `(n // 2 + 3) // 2`.**
