Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is 2; `s` is "00"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 1; `i` is 2; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is 3; `trightZero` is 1; `rightOne` is either 1 or 2; `trightOne` is 0; `leftZero` is -1; `leftOne` is -2.**

Explanation: The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1. Since `rightOne` was either 0 or 1 before the increment, it is now either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
