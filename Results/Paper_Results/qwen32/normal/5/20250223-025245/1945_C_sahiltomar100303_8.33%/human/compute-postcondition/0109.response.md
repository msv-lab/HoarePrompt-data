To determine what will be printed when the `print(right)` statement is executed, we need to refer to the initial state provided.

The initial state specifies:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is 2.
- `s` is "00".
- `mid` is 1.
- `left` is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `leftMove` is 0.
- `rightZero` is 1.
- `trightZero` is 0.
- `rightOne` is 0.
- `trightOne` is 0.
- `leftZero` is 0.
- `leftOne` is 0.
- `right` is not equal to `n` (specifically, `right` is 2).

The variable `right` is explicitly stated to be 2 in the initial state. Therefore, when the `print(right)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `right`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
