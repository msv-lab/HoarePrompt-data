Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the final count of '0's in the first half of `s` after the loop; `rightZero` is the final count of '0's in the second half of `s` after the loop; `leftOne` is the final count of '1's in the first half of `s` after the loop; `rightOne` is the final count of '1's in the second half of `s` after the loop; `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`; `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s`; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s`; `left` is `0`; `leftMove` is `0`; `right` is `n // 2`; the character at position `right` in `s` is '0'.**
