The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `leftOne`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `0`; `rightZero` is `0`; `leftOne` is `0`.**
