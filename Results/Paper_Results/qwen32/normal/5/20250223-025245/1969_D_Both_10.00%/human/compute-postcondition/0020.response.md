Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, which are lists of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers representing prices for Alice and Bob. The function calculates `sub_summ` by adding the sum of the two integers in each tuple of `main_ar` to `sub_summ` only if the sum of the two integers in the tuple is greater than or equal to 0. The function returns the final value of `sub_summ`.**
