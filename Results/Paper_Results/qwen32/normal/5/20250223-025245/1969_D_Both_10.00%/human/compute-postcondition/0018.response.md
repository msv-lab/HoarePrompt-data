To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the effect of each iteration on the `sub_summ` variable. The loop iterates over each tuple in `main_ar`, and for each tuple `val_b`, it checks if the sum of its first and second elements is greater than or equal to 0. If the condition is met, it adds this sum to `sub_summ`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final value of `sub_summ` will be the sum of `sub_summ`'s initial value plus the sum of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for all tuples `val_b` in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.

Let's denote:
- `initial_sub_summ` as the initial value of `sub_summ`.
- `sum_of_valid_elements` as the sum of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for all tuples `val_b` in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.

The final value of `sub_summ` will be `initial_sub_summ + sum_of_valid_elements`.

Since the values of `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are not modified in the loop, they remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `sub_summ`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`sub_summ` is the initial `sub_summ` plus the sum of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for all tuples `val_b` in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the final `sub_summ` is the initial `sub_summ` increased by the sum of the sums of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` that meet the condition `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. The lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr` stay the same.
