Postcondition: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1] < 0`, `sub_summ` remains unchanged.**
