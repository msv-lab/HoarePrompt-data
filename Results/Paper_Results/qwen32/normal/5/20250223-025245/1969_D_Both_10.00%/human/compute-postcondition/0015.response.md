The only variable in the loop head is `val_b`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `main_ar`. If there are more tuples in `main_ar`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `val_b` was the last tuple processed from `main_ar`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more tuple in `main_ar` that `val_b` can take as its value.

Given that `main_ar` must have at least 1 tuple at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `main_ar` must have at least 2 tuples. After the last iteration, `val_b` will now take the next tuple from `main_ar`.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1] < 0`, `sub_summ` remains unchanged.**
