Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`. If `h` is '02', then `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '03', then `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '04' to '11', then `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', then `h1` is '01' to '11' respectively and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` does not match any of these values, `h1` and `time` remain as empty strings.**
