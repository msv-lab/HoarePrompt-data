Reasoning:
The given program is intended to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. However, there are several issues with the provided code that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Midnight and Noon**: The program incorrectly assigns "PM" to midnight ("00:00"). According to the problem description, midnight should be "12:00 AM".
2. **Redundant Code**: The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to map each hour from 00 to 23 to its 12-hour format equivalent. This can be simplified using arithmetic operations.
3. **Inefficient Code**: The repeated code for each hour can be replaced with a more concise and efficient approach, such as using modulo and conditional checks to determine the correct hour and period (AM/PM).

Here is the corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h1 = 12
            time = 'AM'
        elif h < 12:
            h1 = h
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            h1 = 12
            time = 'PM'
        else:
            h1 = h - 12
            time = 'PM'
        
        print(f"{h1:02}:{m:02} {time}")

# Example usage:
# func()
```
This version of the code correctly handles the conversion and edge cases (midnight and noon).

Given the issues in the original code, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
