Let's break down the problem step by step based on the provided initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440. This represents the total minutes since midnight.
2. **`s`**: A string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", representing the time in 24-hour format.
3. **`h`**: The string representation of the hour part of `s`.
4. **`m`**: The string representation of the minute part of `s`.
5. **`h1`**: The string representation of the hour part of `s` converted to 12-hour format with leading zeros removed.
6. **`time`**: A string that is either 'AM' or 'PM', depending on the value of `h`.

### Conditions for `h1` and `time`:
- If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '02' to '12', then `h1` is the string representation of `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '13' to '23', then `h1` is the string representation of `h` converted to 12-hour format with leading zeros removed, and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

### Analysis:
- The `sep=''` argument ensures that there are no additional spaces between the printed elements.
- The output will be a formatted string combining `h1`, `m`, and `time`.

### Possible Values:
- **`h1`**: This will be the hour part in 12-hour format without leading zeros.
- **`m`**: This will be the minute part as it is in the original string `s`.
- **`time`**: This will be either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the time in 12-hour format with the appropriate AM/PM designation, without any additional spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the hour part of `s` in 12-hour format, m is the minute part of `s`, and time is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`)**

However, to provide a more concrete example, let's assume a specific value for `s`:
- If `s` is "14:30":
  - `h` is "14"
  - `h1` is "2" (since 14 in 12-hour format is 2)
  - `m` is "30"
  - `time` is "PM"
  
So, the output would be:
Output: **2:30 PM**

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we describe the output in terms of the variables:
Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the hour part of `s` in 12-hour format, m is the minute part of `s`, and time is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`)**
