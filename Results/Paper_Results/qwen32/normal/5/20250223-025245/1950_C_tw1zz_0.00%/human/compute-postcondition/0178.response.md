Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`. If `h` is `'22'`, then `h1` is `'10'` and `time` is `'PM'`. If `h` is `'23'`, then `h1` is `'11'` and `time` is `'PM'`. If `h` is `'00'`, then `h1` is `'12'` and `time` is `'PM'`. Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.**
