Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, `h1` is '08', `time` is 'PM'.**

In natural language, this means that the value of `time` has been changed to 'PM', while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
