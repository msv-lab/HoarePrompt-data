Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 1440) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. The function returns a value based on the time provided: if the time is between 00:00 and 11:59, it returns "Good Morning"; if the time is between 12:00 and 16:59, it returns "Good Afternoon"; if the time is between 17:00 and 21:59, it returns "Good Evening"; if the time is between 22:00 and 23:59, it returns "Good Night".**
