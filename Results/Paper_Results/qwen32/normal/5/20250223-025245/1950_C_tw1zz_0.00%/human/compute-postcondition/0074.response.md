Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `s` and `h` equals '18', `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, `h1` is `'06'`, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, `time` is 'PM', `h` is not equal to '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', and `h` is not equal to '17'**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the variable `time` is now assigned the value `'PM'`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
