Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `s`, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `time` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `time` remains an empty string.**
