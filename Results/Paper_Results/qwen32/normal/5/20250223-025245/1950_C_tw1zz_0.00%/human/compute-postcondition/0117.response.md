Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `s`, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, and `h` is not equal to '01', '02', '03', '04', or '05'. If `h` is '06', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, if `h` is '07', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '08', then `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '09', then `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '10', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '11', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '13' to '23', then `h1` is the string representation of `h` converted to 12-hour format with leading zeros removed, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. For all other values of `h` (i.e., '01' to '06'), `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.**
