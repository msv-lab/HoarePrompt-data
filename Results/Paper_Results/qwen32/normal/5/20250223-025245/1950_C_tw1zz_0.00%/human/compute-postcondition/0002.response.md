The code snippet assigns an empty string to `h1` and assigns the value of `m` to `m1`. The values of `t`, `s`, `h`, and `m` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `s`, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, `h1` is an empty string, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`.**
