Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`. If `h` is '03', then `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` and `time` are determined based on the value of `h`: `h1` is the same as `h` for '04' to '11', '01' to '11' for '13' to '23', and '12' for '00'; `time` is 'AM' for '04' to '11' and 'PM' for '12' to '23'. If `h` does not match any of these values, `h1` and `time` remain as empty strings.**
