The code snippet assigns an empty string to `h1` and keeps the value of `m1` unchanged. Therefore, `h1` becomes an empty string, and `m1` retains its original value, which is the string representation of the minute part of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, `h1` is an empty string, `time` is determined based on the new value of `h` as per the initial state conditions.**
