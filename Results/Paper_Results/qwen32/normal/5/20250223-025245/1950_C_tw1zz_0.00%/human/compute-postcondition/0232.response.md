The code assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `h`, `m`, `m1`, `h1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`, `h1` is '02', `time` is 'PM'.**
