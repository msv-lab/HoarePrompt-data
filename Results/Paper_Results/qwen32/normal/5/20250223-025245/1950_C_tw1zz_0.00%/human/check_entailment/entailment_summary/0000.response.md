Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format by using a series of `if-elif` statements to handle each possible hour value. However, there is a critical error in the handling of the '00' hour. According to the problem statement, '00:00' should be converted to '12:00 AM', but the program incorrectly converts it to '12:00 PM'. This is the only incorrect conversion in the program, as all other hours are correctly mapped to their 12-hour format equivalents with the appropriate 'AM' or 'PM' suffix.

Given the problem's requirement for exact output, even a single incorrect conversion means the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
