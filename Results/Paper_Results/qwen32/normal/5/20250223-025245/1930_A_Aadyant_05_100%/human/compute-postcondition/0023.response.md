The code snippet `s = s + int(list2[i])` updates the value of `s` by adding the integer value of `list2[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `s` was already updated to `s + int(list2[2])`, and now it is further updated by adding `int(list2[i])` where `i` is 4. Therefore, `s` will be increased by the value of the fifth element in the sorted list `list2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is an empty list; `s` is updated to `s + int(list2[2]) + int(list2[4])`; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user that contains at least two substrings when split by whitespace; `list2` is a sorted list of integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace, and `len(list2)` is at least 5; `i` is 4**
