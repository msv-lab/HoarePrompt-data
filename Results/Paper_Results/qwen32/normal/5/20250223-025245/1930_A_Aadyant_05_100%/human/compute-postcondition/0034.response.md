The code snippet `list2.append(int(str))` attempts to convert the string `str` to an integer and append it to `list2`. However, there is no variable named `str` in the initial state provided. Given the provided initial state, it seems like there might be a typo, and the intended variable might be `n` instead of `str`. Assuming `str` is a typo and should be `n`, the execution would proceed as follows:

- The value of `n` is converted to an integer.
- This integer is appended to the list `list2`.

Given the initial state and assuming `str` is a typo for `n`:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50.
- `a` remains a string input by the user.
- `final` remains a list containing the value of `s`.
- `s` remains 0.
- `b` remains a non-empty string input by the user that contains at least one non-whitespace character.
- `list2` is now a list containing the integer value of `n`.
- `num` is `num + 1`.
- `list1` remains a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace that must be non-empty.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s`; `s` is 0; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user that contains at least one non-whitespace character; `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `n`; `num` is `num + 1`; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace that must be non-empty.**
