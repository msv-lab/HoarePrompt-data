The code snippet appends the integer conversion of `str` to `list2`. Given the initial state, `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace that must be non-empty and have at least one more element; `str` is the next substring in `list1`. After the code execution, `list2` will have an additional element, which is the integer value of `str`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace that must be non-empty and have at least one more element; `str` is the next substring in `list1`; `list2` has an additional element which is the integer value of `str`.**
