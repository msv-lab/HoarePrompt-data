Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect due to several issues:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `n` but then incorrectly assumes that each test case consists of two lines: one line for `n` and another line for the list of integers. In reality, each test case consists of two lines: the first line is the integer `n`, and the second line is the list of `2n` integers.

2. The program reads input in a way that it expects the second input line of each test case to be just a single integer `a` and then the third line to be the list of integers `b`. This is not consistent with the problem description.

3. The program does not handle the input correctly for each test case. It should read the integer `n` for each test case and then read the list of `2n` integers in the next line.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().split()
        a = [int(x) for x in a]
        a.sort()
        s = sum(a[i] for i in range(0, 2*n, 2))
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

func()
```

This corrected version reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of `2n` integers, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair, appending the result to the `final` list. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
