The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num` and `n`. If `num` is less than `int(n)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be less than `int(n)`.

Given that `num` is `num + 1` at the end of the last iteration, we need to adjust `num` to the next value it should take for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended; `s` is the sum of every second element in `list2` starting from index 0; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `num` is the next integer value after the last iteration (i.e., `num + 1`); `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace**.

Since `num` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, we need to ensure that this new value of `num` is less than `int(n)` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended; `s` is the sum of every second element in `list2` starting from index 0; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `num` is the next integer value after the last iteration (i.e., `num + 1`); `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace**.

To be more specific, if `num` was 0 at the start of the last iteration, it would be 1 at the start of the current iteration. For the loop to continue, `num` must be less than `int(n)`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended; `s` is the sum of every second element in `list2` starting from index 0; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `num` is `num + 1`; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace**.

Since `num` was incremented at the end of the last iteration, we need to ensure `num` is still less than `int(n)` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended; `s` is the sum of every second element in `list2` starting from index 0; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `num` is `num + 1`; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace**

Since `num` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended; `s` is the sum of every second element in `list2` starting from index 0; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `num` is `num + 1`; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace**

Given that `num` is incremented, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s` and the value of `s` appended; `s` is the sum of every second element in `list2` starting from index 0; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace; `num` is `num + 1`; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace**
