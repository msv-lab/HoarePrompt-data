Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. If `reachable_first_row` is True, then if `row1[j]` is '>', both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are set to True if `j` equals `n - 1`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains False and `j` is set to `n - 1`. If `row1[j]` is not '>', `reachable_first_row` is set to False, and `reachable_second_row` is set to True if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains False, and `j` is set to 0. If `reachable_first_row` is False, no changes are made to `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, or `j`.**
