Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `results` contains `'NO'`. If `j` is equal to `n - 1` and `reachable_second_row` is `True`, then `j` remains `n - 1`. Otherwise, `j` is 0.**
