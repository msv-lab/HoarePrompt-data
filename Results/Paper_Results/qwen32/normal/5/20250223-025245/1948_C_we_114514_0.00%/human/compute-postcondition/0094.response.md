Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `j` is `j + 2`. If `reachable_second_row` is `True` and `row2[j] == '>'` and `j` equals `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` retains its original value. If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, it retains its original value.**

In simpler terms, `reachable_first_row` has been set to `False`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
