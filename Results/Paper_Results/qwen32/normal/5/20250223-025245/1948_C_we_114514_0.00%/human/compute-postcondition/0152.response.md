Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. `j` is `n`. If `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `reachable_second_row` is updated to `True` if `row1[j] == '>'` and `j` equals `n - 1`, or if `row1[j] != '>'` and `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`. If `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. If `row1[j] != '>'`, `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.**
