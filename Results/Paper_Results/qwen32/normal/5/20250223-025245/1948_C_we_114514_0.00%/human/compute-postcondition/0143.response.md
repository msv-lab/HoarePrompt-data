Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. If `j` was `n - 1` before the if statement and `row2[j]` equals `'>'`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True` and `j` remains `n - 1`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged and `j` remains unchanged.**
