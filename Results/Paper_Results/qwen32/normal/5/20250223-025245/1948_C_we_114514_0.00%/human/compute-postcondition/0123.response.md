Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. The character at index `j` in `row1` is not `'>'`. If `j` is less than `n - 1` and the character at index `j` in `row2` is `'>'`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains `False`.**
