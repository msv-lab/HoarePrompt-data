Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. If `row1[j]` is `'>'`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `j` is equal to `n - 1`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains `False`. If `row1[j]` is not `'>'`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is `'>'`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains `False`.**
