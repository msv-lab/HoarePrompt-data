The code snippet directly assigns `True` to `reachable_second_row` without considering any of the previous conditions or the values of `row1[j]`, `row2[j]`, or `reachable_first_row`. 

Therefore, `reachable_second_row` is now `True`, and all other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `results` contains `'NO'`, `j` is `n`, `reachable_first_row` is unchanged, `reachable_second_row` is `True`.**
