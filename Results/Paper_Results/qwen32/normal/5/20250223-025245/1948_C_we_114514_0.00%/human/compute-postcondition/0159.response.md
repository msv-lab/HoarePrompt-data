The code appends the string `'YES'` to the `results` variable, which is initially a string. However, the `append` method is used on a string, which will result in an `AttributeError` because strings do not have an `append` method. Assuming the intention was to use a list instead of a string for `results`, the output state would be as follows:

Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is `False` or `True` based on `row1` and `row2`, `reachable_second_row` is `True` based on `row1` and `row2`, `results` is `['YES', 'YES']`.**

This means that the `results` variable, which was initially `'YES'`, is now a list containing two elements, both of which are `'YES'`. The values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.
