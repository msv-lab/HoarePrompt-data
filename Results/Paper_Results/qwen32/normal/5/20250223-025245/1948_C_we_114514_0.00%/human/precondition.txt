t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even) and two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters representing the arrows in the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
