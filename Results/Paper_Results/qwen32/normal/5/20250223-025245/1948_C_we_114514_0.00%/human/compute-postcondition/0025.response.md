In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we only need to adjust `j`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then if `row2[j]` is '>', `j` remains equal to `n - 1` if `j` is equal to `n - 1`, otherwise the state of `j` and `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is False, no changes are made to `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, or `j`.

Since `j` is the only variable that can be adjusted in the loop head, we simply increment `j` by 1 to move to the next iteration. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_second_row`) remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is `j + 1`, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged**. 

Given that `j` was the value at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be `j` incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged**.

To make this more concrete, if `j` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be `j` is 1. If `j` was 1, the state at the start of the next iteration would be `j` is 2, and so on.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is `j + 1`, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged**.

Since the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can generalize it to `j + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is `j + 1`, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged**.

For the sake of a concrete example, let's assume `j` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is 1, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged**. 

However, since we are not given the exact value of `j`, the general state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is `j + 1`, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged**.
