Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is True, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is False, `n` is the first element of the next `test_case`, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is True, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, and `reachable_first_row` is True. If `reachable_second_row` is True, the current element `row2[j]` is `'>'`. Additionally, if `j` equals `n - 1`, the specific condition for `j` being the last index is met. If `reachable_second_row` is False, no changes are made to `row2[j]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `j` is `j + 1`. If `reachable_second_row` is `True` and `row2[j] == '>'` and `j` equals `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` retains its original value. If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, it retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `j` is `j + 2`. If `reachable_second_row` is `True` and `row2[j] == '>'` and `j` equals `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True`. If `reachable_second_row` is `True` and `row2[j] == '>'` and `j` is less than `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` retains its original value. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` retains its original value. If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` retains its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
