Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. If `j` was `n - 1` before the if statement, then `reachable_second_row` is `True`. If `j` was not `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. In all cases, `j` remains `n - 1` if `reachable_second_row` is `True` and `j` was `n - 1` before the if statement; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.**
