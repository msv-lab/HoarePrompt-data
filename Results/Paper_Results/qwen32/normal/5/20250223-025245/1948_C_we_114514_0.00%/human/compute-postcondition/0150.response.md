Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `results` contains `'NO'`, `reachable_second_row` is True if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged, `j` is n, `reachable_first_row` is False.**
