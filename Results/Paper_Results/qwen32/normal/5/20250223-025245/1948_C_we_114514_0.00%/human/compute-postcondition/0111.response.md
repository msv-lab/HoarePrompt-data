Output State: **`n` is the first element of `test_case`, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `reachable_second_row` is `True` if any of the conditions mentioned above are met; otherwise, it is `False`, and `results` contains `['YES']` if `reachable_second_row` is `True`; otherwise, `results` contains `'NO'`.**

Explanation: The value of `reachable_first_row` has been explicitly set to `True`. The values of `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_second_row`, and `results` remain as they were in the initial state, except for `reachable_first_row` which has been updated.
