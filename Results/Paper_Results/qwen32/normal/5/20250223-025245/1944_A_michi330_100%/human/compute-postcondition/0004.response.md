The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer input provided such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input and is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.

Since the `print` statement is `print(1)`, it will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **1**
