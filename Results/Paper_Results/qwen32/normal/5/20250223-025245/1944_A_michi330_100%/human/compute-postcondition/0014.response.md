The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the new input, while the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, and `k` is the second integer from the new input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.**
