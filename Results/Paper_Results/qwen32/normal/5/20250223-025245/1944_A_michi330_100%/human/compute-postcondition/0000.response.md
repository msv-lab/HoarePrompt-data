The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be the integer input provided, and the constraints on `t` will still hold.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3.**
