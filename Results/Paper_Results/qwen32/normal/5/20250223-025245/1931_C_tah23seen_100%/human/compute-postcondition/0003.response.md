To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head:

1. `i < len(arr) - 1`: This ensures that `i` is not at the last index of the list `arr`.
2. `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`: This ensures that the current element at index `i` is equal to the next element at index `i + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `n - 1`.

To satisfy the first condition `i < len(arr) - 1`, `arr` must have at least two elements (since `i` is 0).

To satisfy the second condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`, the first two elements of `arr` must be the same.

Therefore, we need to adjust the list `arr` so that `arr[0] == arr[1]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0] == arr[1]` and each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `i` is 0; `j` is `n - 1`.**
