Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The function `func_1` attempts to find the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal by using a single operation, but it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly.

Let's analyze the logic in `func_1`:
- The function tries to find the first and last segments of the array that are made up of the same repeated element.
- It then calculates the cost based on the segments found.

However, the logic is flawed because it only considers the first and last segments and assumes that making the elements within those segments the same will solve the problem. This is not always the case. There might be other elements in the middle that need to be changed, and the optimal solution might involve choosing a different segment or even a different value to set the array elements to.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:
- Consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`. The function will find that the first segment is `[1]` and the last segment is `[1]`. It will then return `max(3 - 1 - 1, 0) = 1`, which is incorrect.
- The correct answer is `2`, because you can choose to set the middle three elements to `2` or `1` (e.g., `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` or `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`), both of which require changing `2` elements.

Therefore, the given program does not handle all cases correctly, and the Correctness is **False**.
