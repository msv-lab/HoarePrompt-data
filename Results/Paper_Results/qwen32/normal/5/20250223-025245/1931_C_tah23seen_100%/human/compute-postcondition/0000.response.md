The code snippet provided initializes the variable `i` to 0. This action does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `arr` and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n, and n is the length of the list arr; i is 0.**
