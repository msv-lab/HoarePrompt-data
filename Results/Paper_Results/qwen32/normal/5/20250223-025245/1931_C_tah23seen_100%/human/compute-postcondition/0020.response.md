Given the initial state, we know:
- `arr` is a list of integers where the first `k` elements are all equal.
- `i` is `k`.
- `j` is `0`.
- `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
- The first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`.

The expression to evaluate is `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

We know `i` is `k` and `j` is `0`. Therefore, we need to evaluate `min(n - k - 1, 0)`. Since `j` is `0`, the expression simplifies to `max(min(n - k - 1, 0), 0)`, which means we are essentially taking the maximum of `min(n - k - 1, 0)` and `0`.

Since `min(n - k - 1, 0)` will always be `0` or a negative number (as `n - k - 1` is the number of elements after the first `k` elements minus one, and `k` is at least `1` because the first element is not equal to the last), the `max` function will always return `0`.

Output State: **The program returns 0**.
