The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing it from 2 to 3. The other variables, `arr`, `j`, and `n`, remain unchanged. The initial condition that `arr[0] == arr[1] == arr[2] == arr[3]` and each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n` is still valid. The value of `n` is the length of the list `arr` and is greater than 3. The value of `j` is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0] == arr[1] == arr[2] == arr[3]` and each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n - 1`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr` with `n > 3`.**
