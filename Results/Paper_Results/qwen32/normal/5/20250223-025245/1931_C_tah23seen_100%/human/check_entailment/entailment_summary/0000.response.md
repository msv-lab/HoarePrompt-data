Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` does not implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal. Instead, it incorrectly returns 0 or a value based on the first and last segments of the array that are not equal, which does not account for the optimal way to make all elements equal using the given operation.

The correct approach involves:
1. Identifying the most frequent element in the array.
2. Calculating the cost to make all elements equal to this most frequent element by applying the operation optimally.

The current implementation is flawed and does not handle the problem requirements correctly.

Correctness: **False**
