The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was initially 1, it is now 2. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0] == arr[1] == arr[2]` and each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `i` is 2; `j` is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0] == arr[1] == arr[2]` and each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`; `i` is 2; `j` is `n - 1`.**
