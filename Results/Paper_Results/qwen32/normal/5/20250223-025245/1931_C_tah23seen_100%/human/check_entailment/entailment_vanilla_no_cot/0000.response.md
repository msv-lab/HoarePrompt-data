Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal with at most one operation.

To solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

1. If all elements are already the same, no operation is needed, and the cost is 0.
2. Otherwise, we need to find the optimal segment `[i, j]` to change to minimize the cost `(j - i + 1)`. This can be done by checking the longest subsequence of the most frequent element, as changing the rest of the array to this element will yield the minimum cost.

The provided solution only checks the boundaries and does not consider the optimal segment to change, which is why it fails for many test cases.
