Reasoning:

The given function `func_1` is intended to solve the problem of determining the least amount of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal by applying the described operation at most once. 

However, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The function starts by finding the first segment of the array from the beginning that consists of identical elements and then finds the last segment of the array that consists of identical elements from the end. This is done by the two while loops.

2. If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it returns the maximum of `j - i - 1` and 0. However, this does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal. This logic only considers the case where the array can be made equal by changing the middle segment, but it does not account for other possibilities.

3. If the first and last elements are different, it returns the maximum of `n - i - 1` and `j`. This is also incorrect. The correct logic should consider the cost to change the entire array to the most frequent element or to a single element by choosing an optimal segment to change.

4. The function does not consider the possibility of changing the entire array to a single element by selecting an optimal segment to change. It does not consider the frequency of elements or the cost to change the array to the most frequent element.

5. The function does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the array has all distinct elements or when the array has a single element.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, and therefore the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
