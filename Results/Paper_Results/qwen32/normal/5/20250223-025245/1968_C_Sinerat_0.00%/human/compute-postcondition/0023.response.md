Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` after the operation, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In this state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, and `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
