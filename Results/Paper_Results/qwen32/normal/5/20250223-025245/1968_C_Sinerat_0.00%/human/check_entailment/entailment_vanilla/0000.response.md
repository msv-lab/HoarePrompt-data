Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The program is supposed to generate an array `a` such that for each `i` from `2` to `n`, `x[i] = a[i] % a[i-1]`. The given program initializes the first element of `a` to `500` and then, for each subsequent element, it sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

Let's verify if this approach satisfies the condition `x[i] = a[i] % a[i-1]`:

1. For `i = 2`, `a[2] = a[1] + x[1]`. We need to check if `x[2] = a[2] % a[1]`. Given `a[2] = a[1] + x[1]`, we have `a[2] % a[1] = (a[1] + x[1]) % a[1] = x[1]`. This is not correct because it should be `x[2]`, not `x[1]`.

2. For `i = 3`, `a[3] = a[2] + x[2]`. We need to check if `x[3] = a[3] % a[2]`. Given `a[3] = a[2] + x[2]`, we have `a[3] % a[2] = (a[2] + x[2]) % a[2] = x[2]`. This is not correct because it should be `x[3]`, not `x[2]`.

It's clear that the current implementation does not correctly compute the array `a` to satisfy the condition `x[i] = a[i] % a[i-1]`.

A correct approach would be:
- Set `a[1]` to any value greater than `x[2]` (since `x[2] = a[2] % a[1]` and `a[2]` must be greater than `x[2]` to ensure a non-zero remainder).
- For each `i` from `2` to `n`, set `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. This ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]`.

However, the given program does not implement this logic correctly, as it incorrectly sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]` and checks against `x[i]` instead of `x[i-1]`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
