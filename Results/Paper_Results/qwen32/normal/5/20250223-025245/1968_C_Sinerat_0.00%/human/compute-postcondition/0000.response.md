In the provided for loop, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input()))`, which means the loop will run `t` times if `t` is a positive integer.

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This state already ensures that the loop can execute because `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1. There are no other variables in the loop head that need adjustment.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute. Here is the state as required:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
