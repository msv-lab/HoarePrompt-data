The code snippet `a = [0] * n` changes the list `a` to be a list of `n` zeros, overwriting its previous values. The variable `t` remains unchanged, `n` retains its value as the integer value of the user's input, and `x` keeps its value as a list of integers obtained from the user's input.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `a` is a list of `n` zeros.**
