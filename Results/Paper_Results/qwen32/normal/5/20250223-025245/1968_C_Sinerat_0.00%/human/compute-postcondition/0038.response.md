To determine the output of the `print(*a)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the construction of the list `a`.

### Initial State Recap:
1. **`t` remains unchanged**: This variable is not relevant to the print statement, so we can ignore it.
2. **`n` is the integer value of the user's input**: This is the length of the list `x`.
3. **`x` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input**: This list has `n` elements.
4. **`a` is a list where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n - 1`) is the cumulative sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, starting with `a[0] = 500`**:
   - `a[0]` is explicitly set to 500.
   - For `i` from 1 to `n - 1`, each element `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

### Construction of List `a`:
- `a[0] = 500` (by definition)
- `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 500 + x[0]`
- `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = (500 + x[0]) + x[1] = 500 + x[0] + x[1]`
- `a[3] = a[2] + x[2] = (500 + x[0] + x[1]) + x[2] = 500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`
- Continuing this pattern, `a[i] = 500 + sum(x[0] to x[i-1])` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

### Output Description:
The list `a` will contain `n` elements, starting with 500 and each subsequent element being the cumulative sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in `x`.

### Example Calculation:
If `n = 4` and `x = [10, 20, 30]`, the list `a` would be:
- `a[0] = 500`
- `a[1] = 500 + 10 = 510`
- `a[2] = 510 + 20 = 530`
- `a[3] = 530 + 30 = 560`

Thus, `a = [500, 510, 530, 560]`.

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the construction of `a`, the output of the print statement `print(*a)` will be the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **500, 500 + x[0], 500 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 500 + sum(x[0] to x[n-2]) (where x is the list of integers obtained from the user's input)**

To make it more precise and easier to understand:

Output: **500, 500 + x[0], 500 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 500 + sum(x[0] to x[n-2]) (where x is the list of integers provided by the user)**
