Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 500
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `a` is updated such that each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of the previous element of `a` and the corresponding element of `x`.

In natural language, the final output state is:

- `t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is the same integer input by the user.
- `x` is the same list of integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is the cumulative sum of the previous element of `a` and the corresponding element of `x`.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains unchanged, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n - 1`) is the cumulative sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, starting with `a[0] = 500`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
