You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it constructs a list `a` of length `n` starting with `a[0] = 500`. Each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`. It then prints the list `a` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The program is supposed to generate an array `a` such that for each `i` from `2` to `n`, `x[i] = a[i] % a[i-1]`. The given program initializes the first element of `a` to `500` and then, for each subsequent element, it sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

Let's verify if this approach satisfies the condition `x[i] = a[i] % a[i-1]`:

1. For `i = 2`, `a[2] = a[1] + x[1]`. We need to check if `x[2] = a[2] % a[1]`. Given `a[2] = a[1] + x[1]`, we have `a[2] % a[1] = (a[1] + x[1]) % a[1] = x[1]`. This is not correct because it should be `x[2]`, not `x[1]`.

2. For `i = 3`, `a[3] = a[2] + x[2]`. We need to check if `x[3] = a[3] % a[2]`. Given `a[3] = a[2] + x[2]`, we have `a[3] % a[2] = (a[2] + x[2]) % a[2] = x[2]`. This is not correct because it should be `x[3]`, not `x[2]`.

It's clear that the current implementation does not correctly compute the array `a` to satisfy the condition `x[i] = a[i] % a[i-1]`.

A correct approach would be:
- Set `a[1]` to any value greater than `x[2]` (since `x[2] = a[2] % a[1]` and `a[2]` must be greater than `x[2]` to ensure a non-zero remainder).
- For each `i` from `2` to `n`, set `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. This ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]`.

However, the given program does not implement this logic correctly, as it incorrectly sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]` and checks against `x[i]` instead of `x[i-1]`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
