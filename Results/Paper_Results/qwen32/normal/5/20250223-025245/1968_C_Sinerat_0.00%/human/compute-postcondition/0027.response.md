The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code reassigns the variable `n` to the integer value of the user's input. The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `x` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is the cumulative sum of the previous element of `a` and the corresponding element of `x`.**
