The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a certain number of times based on the input. The loop will execute as many times as the integer provided by `int(input())`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only thing that needs to be adjusted is the number of iterations left. Since the loop head does not involve `t`, `n`, `x`, or `a`, we do not need to adjust these variables.

The loop will continue to execute as long as the number of iterations specified by `int(input())` has not been reached. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same in terms of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.**
