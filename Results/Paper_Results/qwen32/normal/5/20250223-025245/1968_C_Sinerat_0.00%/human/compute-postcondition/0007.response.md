The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1` (since the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`), and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented by 1, but since the loop has already reached `i = n-1`, it means the loop will terminate after the current iteration. However, to adhere to the task of adjusting the state for the next iteration if it were to continue, we would increment `i` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, `i` is `n`**
