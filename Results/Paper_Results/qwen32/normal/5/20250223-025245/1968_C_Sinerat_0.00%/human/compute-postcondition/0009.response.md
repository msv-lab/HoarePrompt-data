The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented and should be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the loop cannot execute again with the current state. However, to determine the state just before the loop terminates, we need to consider the state just before `i` reaches `n`.

So, just before the loop terminates, `i` should be `n-1` and `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, `i` is `n-1`**
