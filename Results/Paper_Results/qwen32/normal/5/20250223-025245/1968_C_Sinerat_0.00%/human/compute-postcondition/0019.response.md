The code modifies the list `a` by setting `a[i]` to the value of `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `a` starts with its first element as 500 and the rest as 0. After the code execution, the value of `a[i]` will be the cumulative sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i > 0` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.**
