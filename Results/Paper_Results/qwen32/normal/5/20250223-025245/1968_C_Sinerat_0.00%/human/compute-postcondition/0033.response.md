The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 (since the loop starts from 1), and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, incrementing `i` by 1 makes `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

The states of `t`, `x`, and `a` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `a` is a list where the `i`-th element is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is 2**
