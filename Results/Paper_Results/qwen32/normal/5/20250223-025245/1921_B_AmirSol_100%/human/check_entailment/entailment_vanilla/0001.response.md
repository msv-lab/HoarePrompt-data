### Reasoning:

To determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (s1) to the desired state (s2), the program calculates the number of cats that need to be added and the number of cats that need to be removed or moved.

1. **Counting Cats to Add**: The program counts the number of positions where there is no cat in the initial state (s1[i] == '0') but there should be a cat in the desired state (s2[i] == '1'). This is done by the expression:
   ```python
   cats_to_add = sum((1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1'))
   ```

2. **Counting Cats to Remove**: The program counts the number of positions where there is a cat in the initial state (s1[i] == '1') but there should not be a cat in the desired state (s2[i] == '0'). This is done by the expression:
   ```python
   cats_to_remove = sum((1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'))
   ```

3. **Determining Minimum Operations**: The minimum number of operations required to achieve the desired state is the maximum of the two counts (cats_to_add and cats_to_remove). This is because:
   - If there are more positions that need cats to be added than positions that need cats to be removed, then the limiting factor is the number of cats that need to be added.
   - Conversely, if there are more positions that need cats to be removed than positions that need cats to be added, then the limiting factor is the number of cats that need to be removed.
   - If the counts are equal, then the number of operations is simply that count, as each addition can be paired with a removal/move.

The function `func_1` correctly implements this logic, and the program reads the input and applies this function to each test case.
