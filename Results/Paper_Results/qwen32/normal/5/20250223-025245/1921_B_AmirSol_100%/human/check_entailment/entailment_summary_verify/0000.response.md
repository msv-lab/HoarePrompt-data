### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify it against the problem description and the function summary.

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial configuration of cats in boxes (`s1`) to the desired configuration (`s2`). The allowed operations are:
1. Adding a cat to a box (changing a '0' to a '1').
2. Removing a cat from a box (changing a '1' to a '0').
3. Moving a cat from one box to another (changing a '1' to a '0' and a '0' to a '1' in different boxes).

The function `func_1` calculates:
- `cats_to_add`: The number of positions where `s1` is '0' and `s2` is '1'.
- `cats_to_remove`: The number of positions where `s1` is '1' and `s2` is '0'.

The function returns the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`.

### Analysis:

1. **Additions and Removals**:
   - If there are more positions that need cats added (`cats_to_add`) than positions that need cats removed (`cats_to_remove`), the limiting factor is the number of additions needed. This is because every addition operation is independent of the removals, and we need to perform all the additions.
   - Conversely, if there are more positions that need cats removed (`cats_to_remove`) than positions that need cats added (`cats_to_add`), the limiting factor is the number of removals needed. This is because every removal operation is independent of the additions, and we need to perform all the removals.
   - If the counts are equal, the number of additions equals the number of removals, and these operations can be performed simultaneously, but the total number of days required is still equal to the count of either additions or removals.

2. **Simultaneous Operations**:
   - The key insight here is that moving a cat from one box to another can be seen as a combination of a removal and an addition. However, the problem simplifies this by considering the net number of additions and removals required. The maximum of these two counts correctly accounts for the minimum number of days required because any simultaneous operations (like moving a cat) do not reduce the total count of required additions and removals below the maximum of the two.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the function with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - `s1 = "10010"`, `s2 = "00001"`
   - `cats_to_add = 1` (position 5)
   - `cats_to_remove = 2` (positions 1 and 4)
   - `max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove) = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**:
   - `s1 = "1"`, `s2 = "1"`
   - `cats_to_add = 0`
   - `cats_to_remove = 0`
   - `max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove) = 0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**:
   - `s1 = "000"`, `s2 = "111"`
   - `cats_to_add = 3`
   - `cats_to_remove = 0`
   - `max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove) = 3`
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**:
   - `s1 = "0101"`, `s2 = "1010"`
   - `cats_to_add = 2` (positions 1 and 3)
   - `cats_to_remove = 2` (positions 2 and 4)
   - `max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove) = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**:
   - `s1 = "100"`, `s2 = "101"`
   - `cats_to_add = 1` (position 3)
   - `cats_to_remove = 0`
   - `max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove) = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

6. **Example 6**:
   - `s1 = "10011001"`, `s2 = "11111110"`
   - `cats_to_add = 4` (positions 2, 3, 4, 8)
   - `cats_to_remove = 1` (position 1)
   - `max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove) = 4`
   - Output: `4` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The function correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required in all the given examples. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem description and the function summary.
