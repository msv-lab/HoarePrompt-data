The code snippet `count_u = s.count('U')` counts the number of occurrences of the character 'U' in the string `s`. Given the initial state, `s` is `data[2]`, and `count_u` is being assigned the result of this count.

Output State: **`input` is assigned the entire input data as a single string; `data` is a list of strings where the first element is the number of test cases `t` and the subsequent elements are the integers `n` and strings `s` for each test case, all as strings; `t` must be greater than 0; `index` is 3; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `s` is `data[2]`; `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`.**
