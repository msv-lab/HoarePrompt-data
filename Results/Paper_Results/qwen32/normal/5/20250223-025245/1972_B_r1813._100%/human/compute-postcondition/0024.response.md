The code snippet `s = data[index + 1]` updates the value of `s` to the element at the position `index + 1` in the `data` list. Given that `index` is 5, `s` will be updated to `data[6]`.

Here is the updated state:
- `input` is still assigned the entire input data as a single string.
- `data` remains the same list of strings.
- `t` is still greater than 1 and will be decremented by 1.
- `index` is still 5.
- `n` is still the integer value of `data[5]`.
- `s` is now `data[6]`.
- `count_u` is still the number of occurrences of 'U' in the previous value of `s` (which was `data[4]`).

Output State: **`input` is assigned the entire input data as a single string; `data` is a list of strings where the first element is the number of test cases `t` and the subsequent elements are the integers `n` and strings `s` for each test case, all as strings; `t` must be greater than 1 and will be decremented by 1; `index` is 5; `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`; `s` is `data[6]`; `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `data[4]`.**
