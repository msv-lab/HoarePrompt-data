### Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of coins facing up ("U"). According to the problem statement, Alice wins if the number of "U" coins is odd, and Bob wins if it is even. The program reads the input, counts the number of "U" coins for each test case, and prints "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" otherwise. This aligns perfectly with the rules described in the problem statement.

### Correctness: **True**
