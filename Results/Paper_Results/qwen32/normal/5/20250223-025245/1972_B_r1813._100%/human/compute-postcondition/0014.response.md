The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not represent any state that needs to be adjusted. However, the loop's continuation depends on the variable `t` which indicates the number of test cases left to process.

At the end of the previous iteration, `index` is 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, and `s` is `data[2]`. Since the loop iterates `t` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 (since one iteration has just completed).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect a decrement in `t`.

State: **`input` is assigned the entire input data as a single string; `data` is a list of strings where the first element is the number of test cases `t` and the subsequent elements are the integers `n` and strings `s` for each test case, all as strings; `t` must be greater than 0 and decremented by 1; `index` is 3; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `s` is `data[2]`; `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`. If `count_u` is odd, then `count_u` is odd. Otherwise, `count_u` is even.**
