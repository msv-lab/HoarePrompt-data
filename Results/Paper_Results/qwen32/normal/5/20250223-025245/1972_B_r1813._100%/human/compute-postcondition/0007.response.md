The value of `index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `index` was 1, so the new value of `index` is 3. The values of `input`, `data`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`input` is assigned the entire input data as a single string; `data` is a list of strings where the first element is the number of test cases `t` and the subsequent elements are the integers `n` and strings `s` for each test case, all as strings; `t` must be greater than 0; `index` is 3; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `s` is `data[2]`.**
