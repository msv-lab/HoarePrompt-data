Reasoning:  
The provided program solves the problem by counting the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the string `s` for each test case. The logic is based on the observation that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win, and if it is even, Bob will win. This is because each player's move flips two adjacent coins, changing the parity of the number of facing-up coins. If the initial count of 'U' is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of 'U's, and vice versa. The game will end with the player who has an odd number of 'U's at their turn winning, as the last move will always be a winning move for the player with an odd count.

The program reads the input, processes each test case by counting the 'U's, and prints "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" if it is even. This matches the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
