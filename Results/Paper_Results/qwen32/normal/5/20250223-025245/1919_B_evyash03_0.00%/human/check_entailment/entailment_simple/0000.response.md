### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is `|sum(subarray)| * len(subarray)`.
   - The goal is to find the optimal way to split the array to achieve the minimum total penalty.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
   - It then splits the string `s` by the character `'-'` and calculates the sum of the lengths of the resulting parts. However, this step does not seem relevant to the optimal splitting strategy.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `s` and the calculated length.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program iterates over each character in the string `s`:
     - It maintains a `balance` variable that increments for `'+'` and decrements for `'-'`.
     - If `balance` becomes negative, it increments a `count` variable and resets `balance` to 0.
     - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`.
   
3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to be counting the number of times the balance of the array becomes negative (indicating an excess of `'-'` characters) and resetting it to 0.
   - The final return value `count + (balance > 0)` suggests that the program is trying to count the number of segments where the sum is not zero and needs to be split.
   - However, this logic does not directly translate to minimizing the penalty as described in the problem. The penalty calculation involves the absolute value of the sum of each subarray and its length, which is not considered in the given logic.
   - The provided example outputs and the logic in `func_1` do not align with the optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty as described in the problem statement. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the penalty calculation involving the absolute value of the sum and the length of each subarray.

**Correctness: **False**
