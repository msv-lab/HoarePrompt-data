Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1, `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`, `count` is 1 if `balance` was less than 0, otherwise `count` remains 0, and `balance` is `balance - 1` if `balance` was not less than 0 or `balance` remains 0 if `balance` was less than 0, `char` is the next character in `expression`.**

In simpler terms, the `balance` has been decremented by 1. The values of `expression`, `length`, `count`, and `char` remain unchanged except for `balance`. If `balance` was already less than 0, it remains 0; otherwise, it is reduced by 1.
