### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its logic in the context of the problem statement.

The problem requires us to split the given string `s` into non-empty arrays such that the sum of penalties of these arrays is minimized. The penalty of each array is the absolute value of the sum of the array elements multiplied by the length of the array.

The provided code seems to attempt this by maintaining a "balance" counter, which increases with '+' and decreases with '-'. When the balance becomes negative, it increments a `count` and resets the balance to zero. Finally, it adds one to `count` if the balance is positive.

However, this approach does not achieve the goal of minimizing the total penalty. Here's why:

1. **Resetting Balance to Zero:** When the balance becomes negative, it is reset to zero. This means that any positive values that came before the negative ones are ignored, which can lead to suboptimal splits. For example, consider the string "++--". The optimal split would be ("++", "--"), but the code would split it into ("++", "-", "-"), which is not optimal.

2. **Final Balance Check:** The code adds one to `count` if the final balance is positive. This is also not the correct way to calculate the penalty. The penalty should be calculated based on the absolute value of the sum of the array elements multiplied by the length of the array, not just by checking if the balance is positive.

3. **Ignoring Length of Subarrays:** The code does not consider the length of the subarrays when calculating the penalty. The penalty depends on both the sum of the subarray and its length, which is not accounted for in the given code.

The correct approach to solve this problem would involve dynamic programming or a greedy strategy that considers the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. The provided code does not implement such an approach.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as per the provided problem description and execution summary. The logic used in the code does not lead to an optimal solution for minimizing the penalty.

**Correctness: False**
