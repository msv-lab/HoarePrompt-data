Postcondition: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1; `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`; `count` is either 1 or 2 if `balance` was less than 0 before the if-else block, otherwise `count` remains 0; `balance` is `balance - 1` if `char` is '-', otherwise `balance` is incremented by 1 if `char` is '+', and remains unchanged if `char` is '-' and `balance` was not less than 0; `char` is the next character in `expression`.**
