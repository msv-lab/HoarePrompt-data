The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1, `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`, `count` is 1, `balance` is -1, and `char` is '-'.
