### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the minimum penalty for splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. However, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum penalty.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to split the array `a` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
   - The string `s` is split by the character `'-'`, and the sum of the lengths of the resulting parts is calculated.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `s` and the calculated length.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of times the cumulative balance of `'+'` and `'-'` characters becomes negative and resets to zero, plus one if the final balance is positive.

3. **Issues with the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. It only counts the number of times the balance becomes negative and adds one if the final balance is positive, which does not correspond to the penalty calculation as described in the problem statement.
   - The function does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
