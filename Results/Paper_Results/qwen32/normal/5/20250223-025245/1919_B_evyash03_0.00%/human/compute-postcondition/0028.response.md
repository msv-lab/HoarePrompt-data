The code snippet provided resets the `balance` variable to 0. The other variables (`expression`, `length`, `count`, and `char`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1; `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`; `count` is either 2 or 3 if `balance` was less than 0 before the if-else block, otherwise `count` is 1; `balance` is 0; `char` is the next character in `expression`.**
