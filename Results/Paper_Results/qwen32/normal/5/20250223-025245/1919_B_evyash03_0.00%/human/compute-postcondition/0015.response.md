The code snippet `balance += 1` directly increments the value of `balance` by 1. The other variables (`expression`, `length`, `count`, and `char`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1.
- `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`.
- `count` is 1 if `balance` was less than 0, otherwise `count` remains 0.
- `balance` is 0 if `balance` was less than 0 and `char` is '-', otherwise `balance` remains unchanged.
- `char` is the next character in `expression`.

After executing `balance += 1`, the new value of `balance` will be `balance + 1`.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1; `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`; `count` is 1 if `balance` was less than 0, otherwise `count` remains 0; `balance` is `balance + 1`; `char` is the next character in `expression`.**
