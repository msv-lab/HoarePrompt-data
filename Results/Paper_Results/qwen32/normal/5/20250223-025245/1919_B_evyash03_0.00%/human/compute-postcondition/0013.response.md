Postcondition: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1, `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`, `count` is 1 if `balance` was less than 0, otherwise `count` remains 0, and `balance` is 0 if `balance` was less than 0 and `char` is '-', otherwise `balance` remains unchanged.**
