### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Program Overview**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `expression` of length `n`.
   - It then splits the string using `split('-')` and calculates `result_length` as the sum of lengths of these parts.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1(expression, result_length)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through the string `expression`.
   - It maintains a `balance` which is incremented for each `'+'` and decremented for each `'-'`.
   - If `balance` becomes negative, it increments `count` and resets `balance` to 0.
   - It returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before the function call.
   - They also describe the state inside `func_1` and the logic behind the return statement.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program is incorrect.
   - It points out issues with the splitting logic and the penalty calculation.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - The program's splitting logic using `split('-')` is incorrect. This logic does not align with the problem's requirement to split the array into non-empty subarrays such that their concatenation equals the original array.
   - The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the penalty but does so incorrectly. It increments `count` whenever `balance` becomes negative, which does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty.
   - The final penalty calculation `count + (balance > 0)` is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the program.
   - The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem.
   - The correct approach involves dynamic programming or a more sophisticated algorithm to find the optimal splits.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
