The code snippet provided resets the variable `balance` to 0. The other variables (`expression`, `length`, `count`, `char`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1; `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`; `count` is either 1 or 2; `balance` is 0; `char` is the next character in `expression`.**
