You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    parts = expression.split('-')
    result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))
    print(func_1(expression, result_length))

def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
    return count + (balance > 0)



- Function Summary: 
The function takes a string `expression` consisting of '+' and '-' characters and a positive integer `length` representing the length of the string. It returns the number of times the cumulative balance of '+' and '-' characters became negative and was reset to zero, plus one if the final balance is positive.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to split the given string `s` (consisting of `+` and `-`) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to find the optimal way to split the array to get the minimum penalty.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Splitting the String:**
   ```python
   parts = expression.split('-')
   result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))
   ```
   This part of the code splits the string `expression` by `-` and sums the lengths of the resulting parts. This does not help in calculating the minimum penalty because it does not consider the optimal way to split the array.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(expression, length):
       count = 0
       balance = 0
       for char in expression:
           if char == '+':
               balance += 1
           elif char == '-':
               balance -= 1
           if balance < 0:
               count += 1
               balance = 0
       return count + (balance > 0)
   ```
   This function is intended to count the number of times the balance (the sum of the subarray) goes negative and adds an extra count if the balance is positive at the end. However, this approach does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. It does not consider the length of the subarrays or the absolute value of their sums.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach or a greedy algorithm is typically used. The idea is to find the optimal way to split the array such that the sum of penalties is minimized. This involves considering the balance of the subarrays and their lengths.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.
