To determine the final output state after the loop has executed for all characters in the `expression` string, we need to understand how the `balance` and `count` variables evolve as the loop processes each character.

### Key Points:
1. **`balance`**:
   - Increments by 1 for each `'+'`.
   - Decrements by 1 for each `'-'`.
   - Resets to 0 if it becomes negative.

2. **`count`**:
   - Increments by 1 each time `balance` is reset to 0 due to being negative.

### Iteration Process:
- For each character in `expression`, `balance` is adjusted based on whether the character is `'+'` or `'-'`.
- If `balance` becomes negative, it is reset to 0, and `count` is incremented by 1.

### Final Output State:
- **`length`**: Remains unchanged as it is simply the length of the `expression` string.
- **`balance`**: Will be 0 if the loop has processed all characters, as any negative `balance` would have been reset to 0.
- **`count`**: Represents the number of times `balance` was negative and reset to 0.

### Natural Language Explanation:
- After the loop has processed every character in the `expression` string, the `balance` will be 0 because any negative `balance` would have been reset.
- The `count` will reflect how many times the `balance` dropped below 0, meaning how many times a sequence of `'-'` characters outweighed the preceding `'+'` characters.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **expression is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `length`; `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`; `count` is the number of times `balance` was negative and reset to 0; `balance` is 0.**
