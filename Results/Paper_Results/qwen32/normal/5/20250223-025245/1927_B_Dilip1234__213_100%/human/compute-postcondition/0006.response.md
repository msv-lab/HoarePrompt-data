Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n); `s` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(j + ord('a'))`; `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros where `char_count[j]` equals `a[i] + 1`; `j` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `char_count[j]` has been incremented by 1, so `char_count[0]` is now equal to `a[0] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
