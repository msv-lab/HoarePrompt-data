Postcondition: **`s` is a string containing characters 'a' to 'z' in the order they were matched with `a[i]`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` includes 'a' at the end, `char_count[0]` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must still be greater than `i`, and `j` is 0, with the most internal loop or if statement being exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s`, `char_count`, `i`, `n`, or `j`.**
