The code snippet `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends the character corresponding to `chr(j + ord('a'))` to the string `s`. Given that `j` is initially 1, `chr(j + ord('a'))` evaluates to `chr(1 + ord('a'))`, which is `chr(98)`, or the character `'b'`. Therefore, the string `s` will have `'b'` appended to it.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `char_count`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n); `s` is a string containing 'b'; `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros; `j` is 1**.
