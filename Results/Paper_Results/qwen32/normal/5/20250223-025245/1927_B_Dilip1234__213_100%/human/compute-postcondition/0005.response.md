The code snippet appends a character to the string `s` based on the value of `j`. Specifically, it converts `j` to a character by adding it to the ASCII value of 'a'. This character is then concatenated to `s`. The values of `n`, `a`, `char_count`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Given that `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]` initially, this relationship is preserved as none of these variables are modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n); `s` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(j + ord('a'))`; `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros where `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`; `j` is 0.**
