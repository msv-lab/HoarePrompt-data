Postcondition: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is 2, `leftZero` is 3 if `s[1]` is '0' and `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 2 if `s[1]` is '0', or `leftZero` is 1 if `s[1]` is not '0' and `s[i]` is '0', or `leftZero` is 2 if `s[1]` is not '0' and `s[i]` is not '0', `tleftZero` is 3 if `s[1]` is '0' and `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[1]` is '0', or `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[1]` is not '0' and `s[i]` is '0', or `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[1]` is not '0' and `s[i]` is not '0', `leftOne` is incremented by 1 if `s[1]` is not '0', and by 1 again if `s[i]` is not '0', `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 1 if `s[1]` is not '0', otherwise 0, and `tleftOne` is 3 if `s[1]` is not '0' and `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `tleftOne` is 2 if `s[1]` is not '0' and `s[i]` is '0', or `tleftOne` is 2 if `s[1]` is '0'.**
