Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `left` is 1, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is 3, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value of `leftOne` minus 1 if `s[2]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 1 if `s[2]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightOne` is less than `(n - 1) // 2` plus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '1', otherwise it is less than `(n - 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is the same as `rightZero`, `trightOne` is the same as `rightOne` plus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', `leftZero` is -1 and `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 0 and `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and `rightOne` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `left` is decremented by 1, so it changes from 2 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions as described.
