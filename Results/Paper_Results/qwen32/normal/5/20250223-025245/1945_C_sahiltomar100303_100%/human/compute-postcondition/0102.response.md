`tleftOne` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 3) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid - 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, and `tleftOne` is now `tleftOne + 1`.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 3) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid - 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`**.
