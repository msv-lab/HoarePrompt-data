Given the initial state, we have the following information:
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is `n`.
- `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `trightOne` is at least 0.
- The current value of `right` is `n`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(left)
```

Since `left` is explicitly stated to be 0, the `print` statement will output the value of `left`, which is 0.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **0**
