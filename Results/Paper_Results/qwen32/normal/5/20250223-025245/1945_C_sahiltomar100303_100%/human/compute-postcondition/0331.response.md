The code snippet `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `left` is 3, `s` is the value of the user's input, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:3]`, `mid` is 3, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value, `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 1, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[3:n]`, `trightZero` is the same as `rightZero`, `trightOne` is the same as `rightOne`, `leftMove` is 0, and the character at position `s[left - 1]` (i.e., `s[2]`) is '0'.**
