The code snippet assigns the value of `mid` to `right`. Given that `mid` is initially 3, `right` will also be 3 after the assignment. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `left` is 0, `s` is the value of the user's input, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:3]` minus 3, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:3]` minus 3, `mid` is 3, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value of `leftOne` minus 3 if `s[2]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 3, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 3, `trightZero` is the same as `rightZero`, `trightOne` is the same as `rightOne`, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is 3**.
