Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `left` is 1, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is 3, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value of `leftOne` minus 1 if `s[2]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 2 if `s[2]` is '0', otherwise it is the number of '0's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 1, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is the same as `rightZero`, `trightOne` is the same as `rightOne` plus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is decreased by 1. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and `rightOne` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms: The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1, making it one more than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state descriptions.
