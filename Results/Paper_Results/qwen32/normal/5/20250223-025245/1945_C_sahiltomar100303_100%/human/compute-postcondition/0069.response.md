Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n > 0`, `s` is an input string such that `leftZero` (count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`) is less than `n // 4` and `leftZero` is now `leftZero - 1`, `rightOne` (count of '1's in the second half of `s` (from `mid` to `n-1`)) is less than `((n // 2) + 2) // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `n // 2 - 1`, `leftMove` is 0, `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `rightZero` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial states.
