Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0; `s` is the value of the user's input; `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is `leftOne + 1`; `mid`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero` remain unchanged; if `right` is not equal to `n`, `right` remains 4; if `right` equals `n` and `left` is 0, `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2` based on the condition; if `right` equals `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; if `right` does not equal `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; `tleftZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`; `trightOne` is 0; `mid` must be greater than 0; the character at index `i` of `s` is not '0'**

In natural language: The value of `tleftOne` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
