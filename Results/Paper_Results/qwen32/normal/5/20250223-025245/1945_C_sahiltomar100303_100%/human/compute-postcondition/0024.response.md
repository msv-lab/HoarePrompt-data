The variable `leftOne` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `leftOne` is incremented by 1.
