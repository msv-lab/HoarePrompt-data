Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The character '0' indicates that a resident wants to live on the left side, and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side. The function returns the number of residents who want to live on the left side for each test case.**
