The code snippet `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions and constraints for the other variables still hold.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n > 0`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `n // 2 - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`, `leftZero` is decreased by 1, `rightZero` is increased by 1.**
