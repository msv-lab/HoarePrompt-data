The code snippet `leftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' and 1 otherwise plus 1, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `trightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` is not '0' and 0 otherwise, `i` is 1**.

In simpler terms: The value of `leftOne` is increased by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
