Output State: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mid + 1`, `rightZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 3. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` was 1 and `trightZero` was 2. Otherwise, `rightOne` is 2.**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `trightZero`, which has been incremented by 1 from its previous value of 2 to 3. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
