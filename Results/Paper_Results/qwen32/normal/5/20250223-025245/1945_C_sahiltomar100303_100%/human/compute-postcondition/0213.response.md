The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `rightOne` is either 3 (if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0') or 2 (if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'). After incrementing, `rightOne` will be either 4 or 3 respectively. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 1, `leftZero` is -2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is -1, `rightOne` is 4 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 3, `rightZero` is 3 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 2, `leftOne` is -2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `leftOne` is -1, `n` is at least 5**.
