Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n > 0`, `s` is an input string such that `leftZero` (count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`) is less than `n // 4 + 1` and `rightOne` (count of '1's in the second half of `s` (from `mid` to `n-1`)) is less than `n // 4 + 1`. `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0. If the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0', `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1.**
