`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0, and `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer**.
