Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 1`, `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2` plus 1 if `s[right - 1]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`. `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` minus 1 if `s[right - 1]` is not '0', otherwise `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`. `n` is greater than `mid`. If `s[right - 1]` is '0', then `trightZero` is `trightZero - 1`. If `s[right - 1]` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**

In simpler terms: The value of `right` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain with their previous conditions, except that `s[right]` is now `s[right - 1]` in the context of the conditions affecting `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, `trightZero`, and `tleftOne`.
