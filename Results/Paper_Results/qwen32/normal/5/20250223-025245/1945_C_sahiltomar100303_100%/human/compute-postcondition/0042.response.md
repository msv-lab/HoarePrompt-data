Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `n // 2` characters of `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 1 and `trightZero` is 2; otherwise, `rightZero` is 0 and `trightOne` is 2. `rightOne` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0', and 1 if `s[i]` is not '0'.**
