Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, `trightOne` is 0, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0'.**

The value of `tleftOne` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
