Let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `left` is 0.
- `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0.
- `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1.
- `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'.
- `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'.
- `right` is 4 and `right` equals `n` (where `n` is the length of the string `s`).
- `tleftZero` is 0.
- `trightOne` is 1.
- `tleftOne` is 1.
- `trightZero` is 1.
- `tleftZero` is less than (n + 1) // 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(left)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement is only concerned with the value of the variable `left`. From the initial state, it is explicitly mentioned that `left` is 0.

### Output:
The value of `left` is 0, so the `print` statement will output 0.

Output: **0**
