Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `mid` is the same as the initial value, `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0, `s` is the value of the user's input, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 4 and `trightZero` is 3, with `rightOne` and `trightOne` being 0. Otherwise, `s[i]` is not '0', `rightOne` is 1, `trightOne` is 1, with `rightZero` being 1 and `trightZero` being 0, `i` is `mid + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` was '0', `rightZero` was initially 3, so it becomes 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
