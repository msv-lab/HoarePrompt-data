Output State: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mid + 1`, `rightZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', `trightZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0', `rightOne` is 3 if `s[i]` is not '0', `trightOne` is 4 if `s[i]` is not '0'**

Explanation: The value of `trightOne` is incremented by 1. Since `trightOne` was initially 3 if `s[i]` is not '0', after the increment, it becomes 4 if `s[i]` is not '0'. All other variables remain unchanged.
