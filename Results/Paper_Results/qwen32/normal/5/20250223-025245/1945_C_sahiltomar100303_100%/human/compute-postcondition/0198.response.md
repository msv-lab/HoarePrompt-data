The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `leftOne` is 1, it will now be 0. The other variables (`left`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`, and the character at index 0 of the string `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 1, `leftZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 1, `leftOne` is 0, and the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'**.
