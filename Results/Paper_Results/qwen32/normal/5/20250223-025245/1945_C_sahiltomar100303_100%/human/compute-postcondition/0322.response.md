The code snippet `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than `mid`. `mid` remains the same as the initial value. `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0. `s` is the value of the user's input. `leftZero` and `leftOne` are the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:mid]` respectively, and they remain the same. `tleftOne` remains the same as the initial value. `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]` and remains the same. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 4, `trightZero` is 1, `rightOne` is 1, and `trightOne` is 0. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is the initial value of `rightOne` plus 2, `trightOne` is 2, `rightZero` is 0, and `trightZero` is 3. `i` is `mid + 2`.**

In simple terms, the value of `rightOne` is increased by 1, and all other variables retain their initial values.
