The code snippet provided increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. None of the other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `rightOne` will be its initial value plus one.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `left` is 3, `s` is the value of the user's input, `leftZero` is 1, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:3]` minus 1, `mid` is 3, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value of `leftOne` minus 1, `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[3:n]`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 1, `trightZero` is the same as `rightZero`, `trightOne` is the same as `rightOne`, `leftMove` is 0, and the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '1'**.
