Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is an input string with exactly 2 occurrences of '1'. If the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not immediately followed by another '1', then the condition `a.index('1') and a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1'` holds. Otherwise, either the first '1' is at the last position of the string, or the character immediately following the first '1' is also '1'.**
