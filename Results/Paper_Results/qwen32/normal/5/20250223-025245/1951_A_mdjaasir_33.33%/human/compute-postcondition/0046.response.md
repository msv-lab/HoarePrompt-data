Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new user input string, `i` is 2, and `count` is the number of '1's in the new string `a`. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the if part executes; otherwise, the else part executes. In both cases, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `count` remain unchanged.**
