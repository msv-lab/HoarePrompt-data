Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `a`. It then determines if the number of '1's in the string `a` meets specific conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on these conditions. The function does not return any value explicitly; it outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.**
