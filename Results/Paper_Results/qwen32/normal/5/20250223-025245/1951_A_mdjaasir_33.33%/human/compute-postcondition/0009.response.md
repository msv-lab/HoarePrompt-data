The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement outputs the string `'YES'` directly. The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `count`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Based on the code and the initial state, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
