Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the user input string, `i` is 1, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. The condition checks if the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not followed by another '1'. The state of the variables remains unchanged regardless of whether the if condition is true or false.**

This postcondition captures the fact that the variables retain their initial states after the execution of the if-else block, as the if and else parts do not modify any of the variables.
