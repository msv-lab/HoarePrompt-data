Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, and the number of occurrences of '1' in `a` (denoted as `count`) is exactly 2. The first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not immediately followed by another '1'**.
