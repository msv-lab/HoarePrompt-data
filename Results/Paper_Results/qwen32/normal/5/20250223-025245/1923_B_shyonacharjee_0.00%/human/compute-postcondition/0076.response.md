Output State: **`t` is 2; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `healths` is unchanged; `positions` is unchanged; `monsters` is unchanged; `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters processed if `success` is True, otherwise it is the sum up to the point where the loop broke; `position` is the position of the last monster processed; `health` is the health of the last monster processed; `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster processed; `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster processed; `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster processed; `success` is True if the total bullets used never exceeded the time available for any monster, otherwise False.**

In simple terms: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the input, while all other variables remain unchanged.
