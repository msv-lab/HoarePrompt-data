The code reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string into an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `healths`. The variables `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input but are not modified by this specific code snippet. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by space; `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by space.**
