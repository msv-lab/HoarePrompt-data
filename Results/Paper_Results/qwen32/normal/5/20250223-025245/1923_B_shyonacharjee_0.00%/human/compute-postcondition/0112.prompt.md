Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9. a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each i. x is a list of n integers such that -n <= x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n <= n and x_i != 0 for each i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
    positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
    total_bullets_used = 0
    success = True
    for i in range(n):
        position, health = monsters[i]
        distance = abs(position)
        time_available = distance
        bullets_needed = health
        if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
            success = False
            break
        total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
    print('YES' if success else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1; `n` and `k` are integers from the input; `healths` is a list of integers from the input; `positions` is a list of integers from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all monsters if `success` is True; `success` is True if the total bullets used never exceeded the time available for each monster, otherwise False; `position` and `health` are from the last monster in `monsters`; `distance` and `time_available` are the absolute value of the last position; `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1; `n` is unchanged; `k` is unchanged; `healths` is unchanged; `positions` is unchanged; `monsters` is unchanged; `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters processed if `success` is True, otherwise it is the sum up to the point where the loop broke; `position` is the position of the last monster processed; `health` is the health of the last monster processed; `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster processed; `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster processed; `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster processed; `success` is True if the total bullets used never exceeded the time available for any monster, otherwise False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 2; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `healths` is a list of integers from the input; `positions` is a list of integers from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions; `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the `bullets_needed` for all `n` monsters; `position` is the first element of the `n`-th tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the second element of the `n`-th tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of the first element of the `n`-th tuple in `monsters`; `time_available` is the absolute value of the first element of the `n`-th tuple in `monsters`; `bullets_needed` is the second element of the `n`-th tuple in `monsters`; `i` is `n-1`; `success` is `True` if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` never exceeded `time_available` for any monster during the loop, otherwise `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
