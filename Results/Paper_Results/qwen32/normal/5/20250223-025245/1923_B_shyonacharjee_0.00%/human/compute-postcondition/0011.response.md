The code assigns the value of `distance` to `time_available`. The value of `distance` is `abs(position)`, where `position` is the position from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is an integer; `healths` is a list of integers; `positions` is a list of integers; `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `success` is True; `position` is the position from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the health from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is `abs(position)`; `time_available` is `abs(position)`**.
