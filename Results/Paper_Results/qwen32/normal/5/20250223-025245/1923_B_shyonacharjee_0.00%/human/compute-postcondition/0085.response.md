Output State: **`t` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is an input integer; `healths` is a list of integers from the input; `positions` is a list of integers from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `position` is the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`; `time_available` is the absolute value of the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`; `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster processed; `success` is True; `i` is 0**.

Explanation: The value of `time_available` is updated to be equal to `distance`, which is the absolute value of the position of the first monster in the `monsters` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
