Postcondition: **`t` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is an input integer; `healths` is a list of integers from the input; `positions` is a list of integers from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `position` is the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`; `time_available` is the absolute value of the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`; `bullets_needed` is the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`; `i` is 0. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, then `success` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `success` remains True.**
