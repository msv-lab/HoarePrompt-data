The given Python code snippet contains a print statement that outputs the string `'Alice'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `s`, `a`, and `b`, but these are not used in the print statement. Therefore, the output of the print statement is not influenced by the values of these variables.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer input provided, and it is within the range 1 to 1000.
- `s` is a string input provided.
- `a` is the integer value of the first substring of `s`.
- `b` is the integer value of the second substring of `s`.
- The sum of `a` and `b` is odd.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `s`, `a`, `b`) are referenced in the print statement `print('Alice')`. Thus, the output is simply the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
