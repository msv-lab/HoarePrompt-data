The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is the integer input provided, and 1 <= `t` <= 1000. This range already ensures that the loop will execute at least once because `t` is at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop variable and is initialized automatically by the `range` function, so it doesn't need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is the integer input provided, and 1 <= `t` <= 1000**
