### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the game mechanics and the given solution.

1. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - They can either swap wallets or keep their current one.
   - They must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Given the rules, the player who starts with an odd total number of coins (a + b) will always win if both play optimally.
   - Conversely, if the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) will win.

3. **Explanation of the Solution:**
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b` in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then calculates the sum `a + b`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob" (indicating Bob wins).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice" (indicating Alice wins).

4. **Verification with Example Test Cases:**
   - For the test case `1 1`:
     - `a + b = 2` (even), so the output is "Bob".
   - For the test case `1 4`:
     - `a + b = 5` (odd), so the output is "Alice".
   - For the test case `5 3`:
     - `a + b = 8` (even), so the output is "Bob".
   - For the test case `4 5`:
     - `a + b = 9` (odd), so the output is "Alice".
   - And so on...

The solution correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the sum of the coins. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if odd, Alice wins. This matches the optimal play strategy for the game.
