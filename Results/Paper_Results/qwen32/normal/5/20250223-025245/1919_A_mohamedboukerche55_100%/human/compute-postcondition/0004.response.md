The code takes the string `s`, splits it into a list of substrings, and then converts the second substring into an integer, which is assigned to `b`. The value of `t` and `a` remains unchanged. The value of `b` is now the integer value of the second substring of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided, and 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is the string input provided; `a` is the integer value of the first substring of `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second substring of `s`.**
