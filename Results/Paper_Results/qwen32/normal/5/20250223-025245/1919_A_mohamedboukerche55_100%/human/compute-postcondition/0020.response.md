The code snippet `b = int(list(s.split())[1])` splits the string `s` into a list of substrings, converts the second substring to an integer, and assigns it to `b`. The variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is not affected by this code snippet as the increment operation `i += 1` was not part of the provided code snippet.

Given the initial state, `b` is reassigned to the integer value of the second substring of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided, and 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is the new string input provided; `a` is the integer value of the first substring of the new `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second substring of the new `s`.**
