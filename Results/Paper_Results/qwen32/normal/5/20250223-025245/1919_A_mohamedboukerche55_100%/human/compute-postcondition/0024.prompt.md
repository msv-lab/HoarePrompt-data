Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer input provided, and 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    a = int(list(s.split())[0])
    b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer input provided, and 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is the string input provided; `a` is the integer value of the first substring of `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second substring of `s`. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the integer input provided, and 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is the new string input provided; `a` is the integer value of the first substring of the new `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second substring of the new `s`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. Regardless of whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the integer input provided, and 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is the new string input provided; `a` is the integer value of the first substring of the new `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second substring of the new `s`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, then the conditions of the if part are satisfied. Otherwise, the conditions of the else part are satisfied.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
