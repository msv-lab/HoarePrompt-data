Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input provided, and 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is the new string input provided; `a` is the integer value of the first substring of the new `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second substring of the new `s`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, then the conditions of the if part are satisfied. Otherwise, the conditions of the else part are satisfied.**
