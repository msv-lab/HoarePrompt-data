### Reasoning:

The given problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins, with the player who cannot make a move losing. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Parity Analysis**:
   - If `a + b` is **even**, Bob wins.
   - If `a + b` is **odd**, Alice wins.

This is because:
- When `a + b` is even, the total number of moves available in the game is even. Since Alice starts first, she will always leave an odd number of moves for Bob, and Bob will eventually be the one who cannot make a move.
- When `a + b` is odd, the total number of moves available in the game is odd. Alice will be the one to make the last move and thus win the game.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then checks the parity of `a + b` and prints "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

This logic aligns perfectly with the key observations derived above. Therefore, the program is correctly implementing the solution to the problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
