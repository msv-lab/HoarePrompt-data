Let's analyze the given task step by step:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input provided, and it satisfies the condition 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `s` is a string input provided.
- `a` is the integer value of the first substring of the new `s`.
- `b` is the integer value of the second substring of the new `s`.

The Python code snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, `a`, or `b`. The statement simply prints the string 'Alice'.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Alice**
