### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to verify that it correctly implements the rules of the game as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key components and their functionalities:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the dimensions of the field (`N` and `M`).
   - It then reads the initial state of the field, identifying the positions of the goals, players, Quaffle, and Bludger.
   - It initializes the scores for both teams (`rs` for red and `bs` for blue) and the `carry` variable to keep track of which player, if any, is carrying the Quaffle.

2. **Processing Each Action:**
   - For each action, the program identifies the entity performing the action and the type of action.
   - If the action is to catch the Quaffle (`C`), the program sets the `carry` variable to the player's identifier.
   - If the action is to throw the Quaffle (`T`), the program sets the `carry` variable to `None` and checks if the Quaffle is in a goal. If it is, the program updates the score for the appropriate team and resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field.
   - If the action is a movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), the program updates the position of the entity using the `func_1` function.
   - After processing the movement, if the entity carrying the Quaffle moved, the Quaffle's position is also updated to match the player's position.

3. **Checking for Eliminations:**
   - After each action, the program checks if any player's position matches the Bludger's position using the `func_2` function.
   - If a match is found, the player is eliminated, and the program prints the appropriate message.

4. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all actions, the program prints the final score of the game.

### Analysis of Functions:
- **`func_1`**: This function correctly updates the position of an entity based on the direction of movement. It handles all four possible directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R').
- **`func_2`**: This function correctly identifies and eliminates players who are in the same position as the Bludger. It sorts the list of eliminated players and prints their identifiers in alphabetical order.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the game rules as described in the problem statement. It handles all types of actions, updates the game state accordingly, checks for eliminations, and outputs the correct events and final score.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
