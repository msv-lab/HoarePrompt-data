You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, player is a dictionary where keys are player identifiers (strings in the format "R0", "B0", ..., "R9", "B9") and values are lists of two integers representing the player's position on the field, and blud is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field.
def func_2(t):
    out = []
    for p in player:
        if player[p] == blud:
            out.append(p)
            player[p] = [-1, -1]
        
    #State: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary where `player[p]` is `[-1, -1]` if `player[p]` was equal to `blud` at any point during the loop, otherwise `player[p]` remains unchanged, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, and `out` is a list containing the values of all player identifiers `p` for which `player[p]` was equal to `blud`.
    for p in sorted(out):
        print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
        
    #State: `t` is a non-negative integer, `player` is a dictionary, `blud` is a list of two integers, and `out` is an empty list. All player identifiers in the original `out` have been printed with the message 'ELIMINATED'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player`, which is a dictionary where keys are player identifiers (strings in the format "R0", "B0", ..., "R9", "B9") and values are lists of two integers representing the player's position on the field, and `blud`, which is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field. The function returns a specific value or performs an action based on these inputs, but the exact return value or action is not specified in the given information.

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
