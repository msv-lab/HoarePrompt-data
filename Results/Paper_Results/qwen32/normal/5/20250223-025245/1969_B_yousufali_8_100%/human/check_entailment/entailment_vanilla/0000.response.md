Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order using a specific operation: cyclically shifting a substring. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted. We need to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

### Key Observations

1. **Binary String Characteristics**: Binary strings consist of only '0's and '1's.
2. **Sorted Condition**: The string is sorted in non-descending order if all '1's are to the right of all '0's.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost to move a '1' to the left of a '0' is the number of positions it needs to be shifted plus one. This is because the operation involves shifting a substring that includes the '1' and potentially other characters to the right of it.

### Strategy

To sort the string, we need to move all '1's to the right of all '0's. The cost of moving each '1' to the correct position can be calculated by counting how many '0's it needs to pass. For each '0' encountered after a '1', the cost to move that '1' past the '0' is the number of '1's encountered so far plus one.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly implements the above strategy:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - Reads a binary string `s`.
  - Initializes `n` (count of '1's encountered) and `ans` (total cost).
  - Iterates through the string:
    - Increments `n` for each '1'.
    - For each '0' encountered after at least one '1', adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
  - Prints the total cost `ans`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Verification

The program correctly implements the strategy:
- It counts the number of '1's encountered (`n`).
- For each '0' encountered after a '1', it calculates the cost to move the '1's past that '0' as `n + 1`.
- It accumulates these costs to get the total minimum cost to sort the string.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the given operation.

**Correctness: True**
