To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operations.

### Analysis:

The problem requires us to calculate the minimal cost to sort a binary string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's. The cost of cyclically shifting a substring `s[l:r+1]` is `r - l + 1`.

The provided solution works as follows:
1. Initialize `n` to count the number of '1's encountered so far.
2. Initialize `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
3. Iterate through the string `s`:
   - If the current character is '1', increment `n`.
   - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero (indicating that there have been '1's before this '0'), add `n + 1` to `ans`. The `+1` accounts for the cost of shifting the substring that includes the current '0' and the `n` preceding '1's.

### Correctness Check:

Let's consider the logic:
- The cost `n + 1` is added whenever a '0' is encountered after some '1's, which means that to bring all '1's before this '0' to its correct position, we need to perform a cyclic shift involving these `n` '1's and the '0'.
- The cost `n + 1` correctly reflects the length of the substring that needs to be cyclically shifted.

However, the provided solution does not handle all edge cases correctly:
- Consider the string "11000": The correct minimum cost is 9, which can be achieved by shifting substrings as described in the problem statement. The provided solution calculates `ans` as 5, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not always compute the correct minimum cost for sorting the binary string using the described cyclic shift operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Your response:
Correctness: **False**
