### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered and `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
   - It iterates through each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero (meaning there have been some '1's before this '0'), it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. The `+1` accounts for the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.
   - Finally, it prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

The logic of `func_1` is based on the observation that whenever a '0' follows one or more '1's, we need to perform a cyclic shift to bring the '1's before the '0'. The cost of this shift is the length of the substring that includes these '1's and the '0', which is `n + 1`.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's verify the logic with the first example provided:
- Input: `10`
- `n` starts at 0.
- At index 0, `s[0]` is '1', so `n` becomes 1.
- At index 1, `s[1]` is '0', and `n` is not zero, so `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
- Output: `2`

This matches the expected output for the first test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The provided test cases and their expected outputs align with the program's functionality.

**Correctness: True**
