The code snippet `ans += n + 1` increases the value of `ans` by `n + 1`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `n` are not directly modified by this line, but the value of `ans` is updated based on the current value of `n`.

Output State: **`s` is a binary string with at least 1 character, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by `n + 1`.**
