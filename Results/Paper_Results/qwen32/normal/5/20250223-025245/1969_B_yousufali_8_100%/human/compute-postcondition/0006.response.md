To accurately determine the output state, we need to know the definition of `func_1()`. Since the function `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific impact it has on the variables. 

However, if we assume that `func_1()` does not modify the variable `t` and does not introduce any new variables or modify any existing ones, the output state would simply be the same as the initial state.

Given the lack of information about `func_1()`, the most we can conclude is that `t` remains 2, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is 2**.
