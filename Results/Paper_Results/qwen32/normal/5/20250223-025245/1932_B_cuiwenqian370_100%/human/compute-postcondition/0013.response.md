Given the provided Python code snippet and the initial state, we need to determine the output state after executing the given line of code. Let's break down the calculation of `next_year` based on the initial state.

The line of code is:
```python
next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
```

Breaking down the calculation:
- `last_year` is the first element of the list `a`, which is `a[0]`.
- `a[i]` is an element of the list `a` at index `i`.

The expression simplifies to:
```python
next_year = (last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]
```
This expression can be further simplified to:
```python
next_year = (last_year // a[i] + 1) * a[i]
```
This means `next_year` will be the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace, `input` holds the entire input string, `index` is `index + n`, `T` is an integer value greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `last_year` is `a[0]`, `next_year` is `(last_year // a[i] + 1) * a[i]`.**

In natural language: The variable `next_year` is calculated as the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
