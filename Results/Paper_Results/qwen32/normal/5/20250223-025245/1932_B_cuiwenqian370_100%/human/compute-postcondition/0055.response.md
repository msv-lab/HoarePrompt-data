Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace, `input` holds the entire input string, `index` is `index + 2*n + 1`, `T` is an integer value greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and `last_year`, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `i` is 1, `next_year` is `(next_year + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `last_year` has been updated to be equal to `next_year`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
