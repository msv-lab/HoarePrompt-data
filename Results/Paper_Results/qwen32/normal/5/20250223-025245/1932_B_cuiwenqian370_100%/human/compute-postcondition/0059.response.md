The code provided writes the contents of the `results` list to the standard output, with each element separated by a newline character, and an additional newline character at the end. This action does not change the values of the variables `data`, `input`, `index`, `T`, or `results`. It only outputs the contents of `results`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` points to the position right after the last element of the last test case; `T` is 0; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` for each test case; the contents of `results` have been written to the standard output with each element separated by a newline character and an additional newline character at the end.**
