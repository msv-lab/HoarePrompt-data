### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs at regular intervals and must occur sequentially. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input from standard input in a single read operation and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the first integer to determine the number of test cases, `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`. This is because the first sign will occur at the first multiple of `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year the sign can occur using the formula: 
     ```
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
     This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`. Here's a breakdown of the formula:
     - `last_year + 1` ensures that we are looking for the next occurrence after `last_year`.
     - `a[i] - 1` is added to ensure that we round up to the next multiple of `a[i]`.
     - The entire expression `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` effectively calculates the ceiling of `(last_year + 1) / a[i]` and multiplies it by `a[i]` to get the next multiple.

3. **Updating the Last Year:**
   - After calculating `next_year`, it updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues to the next sign.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur by ensuring each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The formula used to calculate the next occurrence of each sign is correct, and the program handles multiple test cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.

### Your Response:
Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur by ensuring each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one using the appropriate formula. It handles multiple test cases as required.
Correctness: **True**
