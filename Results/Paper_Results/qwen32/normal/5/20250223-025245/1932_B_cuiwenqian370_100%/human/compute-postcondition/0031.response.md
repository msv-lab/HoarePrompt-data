The code snippet provided is:

```python
last_year = next_year
```

This line assigns the value of `next_year` to `last_year`. 

Given the initial state, `last_year` is already defined and equal to `next_year`. After executing this line, `last_year` will still be equal to `next_year`, as the value of `next_year` is directly assigned to `last_year`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same for `last_year` and `next_year` in terms of their relationship, but we need to reflect that `last_year` is explicitly set to `next_year` in the output state.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`; `n` is an integer value greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`; `i` is 1; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`.**
