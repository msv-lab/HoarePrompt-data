Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and `last_year`; `n` is an integer value greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`; `i` is `n-1`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[n-1]) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`.**

In simpler terms, the `results` list now contains two string representations of `last_year`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
