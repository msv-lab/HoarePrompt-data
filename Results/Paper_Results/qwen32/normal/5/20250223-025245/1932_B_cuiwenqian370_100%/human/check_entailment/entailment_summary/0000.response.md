Reasoning:
The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the given description and the example test cases. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `T` from the first element of this list.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes `last_year` with the periodicity of the first sign `a[0]`.
   - It then iteratively calculates the year for each subsequent sign based on the formula:
     ```python
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
     This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.

3. **Updating `last_year`:**
   - After calculating `next_year`, the program updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues to the next sign.

4. **Storing and Printing Results:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program stores the final `last_year` (which is the year the n-th sign occurs) in the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints all results, each on a new line.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes each test case correctly and calculates the synchronized blinking periodicity for all signs, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Hence, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example test cases.

Correctness: **True**
