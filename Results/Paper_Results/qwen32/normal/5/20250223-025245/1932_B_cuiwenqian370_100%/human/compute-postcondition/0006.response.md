The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones according to the code. The loop will execute based on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The other variables (`data`, `input`, `index`, `results`) are not directly related to the execution of the loop itself, but they are part of the provided state.

For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. The value of `_` is irrelevant before the loop starts because it is a throwaway variable used in the loop.

State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is 1; `T` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is an empty list**
