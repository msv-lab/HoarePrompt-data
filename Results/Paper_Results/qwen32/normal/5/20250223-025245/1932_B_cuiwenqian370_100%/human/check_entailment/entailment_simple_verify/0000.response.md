### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated version to ensure the correctness of the solution.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.

2. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
   - This formula is intended to find the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

3. **Validation of the Formula:**
   - The formula can be simplified to:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + a[i]}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
   - This is equivalent to:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\left\lceil \frac{\text{last\_year} + 1}{a[i]} \right\rceil \right) \times a[i]
     \]
   - This ensures that `next_year` is the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Sign (n=1):** If there is only one sign, the year of the apocalypse is simply `a[0]`. The program correctly handles this case since `last_year` is initialized to `a[0]`.
   - **Multiple Signs:** For multiple signs, the program correctly calculates the year of each sign based on the previous sign's occurrence.
   - **All Signs with Periodicity 1:** If all signs have the same periodicity (e.g., `a = [1, 1, 1]`), the program correctly calculates the year as `n` (since each sign occurs every year).
   - **Different Periodicities:** If the periodicities are different, the program correctly calculates the year based on the sequential occurrences.

5. **Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at various points.
   - The final state of `results` contains the correct year for the `n`-th sign for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program logic and the annotations align with the problem description and correctly handle all edge cases and scenarios. The formula used ensures that each sign occurs on the next multiple of its periodicity after the previous sign, which is the correct approach as per the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and handles all given scenarios accurately.
