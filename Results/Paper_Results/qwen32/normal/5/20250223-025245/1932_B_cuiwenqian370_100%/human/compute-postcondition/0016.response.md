The code modifies the value of `next_year` based on the current values of `last_year` and `a[i]`. The new value of `next_year` is calculated as `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which simplifies to `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that is changed by the code is `next_year`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace, `input` holds the entire input string, `index` is `index + n`, `T` is an integer value greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `last_year` is `(last_year // a[i] + 1) * a[i]`, `next_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`, `i` is 1**.
