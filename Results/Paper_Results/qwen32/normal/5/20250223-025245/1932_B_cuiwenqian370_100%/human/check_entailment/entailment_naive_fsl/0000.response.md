Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
The Chaya tribe has `n` signs of the apocalypse, each occurring periodically every `a_i` years. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the `i+1`-th sign can only occur after the `i`-th sign. The task is to determine in which year the `n`-th sign will occur.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the year in which each sign occurs sequentially. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.

2. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs on the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year + 1`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it stores the year of the `n`-th sign in the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints all results.

### Correctness Verification:
Let's verify if the program handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

- **Single Sign (n=1):**
  - If there is only one sign, the year of the apocalypse is simply `a[0]`.
  - The program correctly handles this case since `last_year` is initialized to `a[0]`.

- **Multiple Signs:**
  - For multiple signs, the program correctly calculates the year of each sign based on the previous sign's occurrence.
  - The formula used ensures that each sign occurs on the next multiple of its periodicity after the previous sign.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If all signs have the same periodicity (e.g., `a = [1, 1, 1]`), the program correctly calculates the year as `n` (since each sign occurs every year).
  - If the periodicities are different, the program correctly calculates the year based on the sequential occurrences.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all described scenarios, including edge cases. It follows the problem description accurately and calculates the year of the `n`-th sign correctly for each test case.

Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The program reads the input correctly, initializes the year of the first sign, and iteratively calculates the year for each subsequent sign using the correct formula. It handles all edge cases and scenarios described in the problem statement, ensuring the correct output for every potential input.
