The code snippet updates the value of `arr` by mapping the slice of `data` starting from `index` to `index + n` to integers. The variables `data`, `index`, `n`, `results`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Given:
- `arr` was initially a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`.
- `index` is `3 + 2n + 1`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`.

After the execution of `arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`:
- `arr` is now a list of integers derived from the slice `data[index:index + n]`, which is `data[3 + 2n + 1:3 + 3n + 1]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from the slice `data[3 + 2n + 1:3 + 3n + 1]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n + 1`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `results` is a list containing the `result` value twice; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.
