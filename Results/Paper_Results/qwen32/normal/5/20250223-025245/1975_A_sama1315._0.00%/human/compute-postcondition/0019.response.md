Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `results` is a list containing the `result` value twice; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**

Explanation: The code appends the `result` value to the `results` list, which already contains the `result` value. Therefore, `results` now contains the `result` value twice. All other variables remain unchanged.
