To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is only the underscore `_` representing the loop variable. However, the loop variable `_` does not influence the state directly. Instead, we need to consider how the loop condition and the provided state evolve.

The loop is defined as:
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```
This means the loop will execute `t` times. The state provided includes `t`, which is the number of iterations the loop will perform.

Given:
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `index` is `2 + n`
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`
- `results` is a list containing the `result` value
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`

The loop variable `_` does not change the state directly, but the loop will execute `t` times. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, and we are only adjusting states of objects in the loop head, the only relevant state to adjust here is `t`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`. For the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `results` is a list containing the `result` value; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**
