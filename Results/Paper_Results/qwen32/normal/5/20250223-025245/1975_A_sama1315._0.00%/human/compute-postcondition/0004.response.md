Output State: **`arr` is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each element in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings, where each string is a positive integer from the input; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

In simple terms, the `index` variable has been incremented by 1, while the other variables (`arr`, `data`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
