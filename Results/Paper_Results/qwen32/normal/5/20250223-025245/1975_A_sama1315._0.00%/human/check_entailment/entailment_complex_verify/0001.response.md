### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where each operation involves splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping these two parts.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
   - The function checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`.
   - If the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, it returns "Yes".
   - If any element is greater than the next element, it proceeds to the `else` clause.
   - The `else` clause contains a condition `any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`, which is redundant because the `if` condition already ensures that the array is either sorted or not.
   - The `else` clause incorrectly checks if the array is sorted in non-increasing order and returns "Yes" if it is. However, the problem requires checking if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the allowed operations, not if it is already sorted in non-increasing order.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the array and calls `func_1(arr)` to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It collects the results for all test cases and prints them.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The function `func_1` is described as checking if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order and returning "Yes" if it is. If not, it incorrectly checks if the array is sorted in non-increasing order and returns "Yes" if it is.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is incorrect because `func_1` does not implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operations.
- The `else` clause in `func_1` is identified as incorrect because it checks for non-increasing order, which is not relevant to the problem.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operations. The `else` clause in `func_1` is redundant and incorrectly checks for non-increasing order.

### Final: **False**
