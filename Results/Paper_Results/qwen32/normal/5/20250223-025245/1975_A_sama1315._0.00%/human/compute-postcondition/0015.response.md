The code snippet increments the value of `index` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `results` is a list containing the `result` value; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.
