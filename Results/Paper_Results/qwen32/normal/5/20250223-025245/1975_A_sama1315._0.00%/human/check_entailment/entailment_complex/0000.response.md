Reasoning: 
The given program is intended to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of prefix-suffix swaps. The logic of the program is flawed, however, as it doesn't correctly implement the necessary checks to determine if such a series of swaps can achieve a sorted array.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns 'Yes'. If it's not, it incorrectly returns 'No' without considering the possibility of sorting through prefix-suffix swaps.
   - The problem requires checking if the array can be split into two parts such that swapping these parts results in a sorted array. This involves more than just checking if the array is already sorted.

2. **Function `func_2` Logic**:
   - This function reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` for each array. It collects the results and prints them.
   - The logic here is correct in terms of reading and processing the input, but the results are incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted through the allowed operations.

The correct approach would involve finding a point in the array where it can be split into two parts such that the suffix followed by the prefix is sorted. This requires checking for a point where the array transitions from a non-decreasing sequence to a non-increasing sequence and back to a non-decreasing sequence.

Given the issues with `func_1`, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
