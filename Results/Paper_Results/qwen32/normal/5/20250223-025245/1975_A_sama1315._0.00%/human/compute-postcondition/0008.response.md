The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each element in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings, where the first string `data[0]` is a positive integer; `index` is 2; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` which must be greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
