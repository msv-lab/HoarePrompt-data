Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations. Each operation consists of splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping these two parts. The key insight is that the only way to sort the array using this operation is if the array is already sorted or if it can be split into two parts such that the suffix is less than or equal to the prefix and the prefix is greater than or equal to the suffix when reversed.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(arr)**: This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns "Yes". If there is any element that is greater than the next element, it returns "No". However, it also has an else clause that checks if the array is sorted in non-increasing order, which is incorrect for this problem. The else clause should not exist because the array could still be unsortable even if it is not sorted in non-increasing order.
2. **func_2()**: This function reads the input, processes each test case using the `func_1` function, and prints the results.

### Issues in the Program:
- The `func_1` function incorrectly checks if the array is sorted in non-increasing order and returns "Yes" in that case. This is not a valid condition for the problem as the array needs to be sorted in non-decreasing order after some operations, not necessarily non-increasing.
- The program does not handle the scenario where the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix can be moved to the front to sort the array. The function `func_1` does not implement this logic.

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operations. The function `func_1` incorrectly checks for non-increasing order and does not handle the logic for splitting and swapping parts of the array.

### Correctness: **False**
