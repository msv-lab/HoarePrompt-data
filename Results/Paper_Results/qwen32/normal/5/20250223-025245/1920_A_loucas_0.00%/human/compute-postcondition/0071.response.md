Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `loop` remains unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than `iterable2`, `iterable2` is incremented by 1, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big`, `less`, and `no` are initialized based on the new value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `big` contains the value of `a`. If `x` is 2, `less` includes `a` as its last element. Otherwise, `no` includes `a` as its last element.**
