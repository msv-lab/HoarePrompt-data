Output State: **`num` is `i`, `iterable` is a valid integer, `loop` remains unchanged, `innerLoop` is a valid integer, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1 (must be non-empty), `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2 (must be non-empty and `min(less)` must be greater than `max(big)`), `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `i` is `i+1`**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to be equal to `i`. The values of `iterable`, `loop`, `innerLoop`, `big`, `less`, `no`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` has been incremented by 1.
