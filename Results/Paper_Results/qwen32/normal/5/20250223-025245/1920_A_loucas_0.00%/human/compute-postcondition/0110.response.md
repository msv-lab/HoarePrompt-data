Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is a valid integer (e.g., 0), `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing the input integer `a` if `x` is 2; otherwise, `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the input integer `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 and not equal to 2; otherwise, `no` is an empty list, `loop` remains unchanged, `x` is an input integer that is not equal to 1, `a` is an input integer.**
