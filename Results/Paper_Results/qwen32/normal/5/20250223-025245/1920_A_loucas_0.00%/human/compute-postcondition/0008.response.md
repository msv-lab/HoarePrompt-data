The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `a`. The other variables (`t`, `loop`, `less`, `big`, `no`, `num`, `innerLoop`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `a` are integers read from the input.**
