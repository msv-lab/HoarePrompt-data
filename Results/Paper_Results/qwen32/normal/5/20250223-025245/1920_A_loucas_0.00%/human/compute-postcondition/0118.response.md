Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is a valid integer, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `loop` remains unchanged, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 1, `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 2, and `no` is a list containing `a` if `x` is neither 1 nor 2. If `x` is not 2, `no` includes `a` regardless of the initial condition.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block is executed, considering all possible values of `x` and how they affect the lists `big`, `less`, and `no`.
