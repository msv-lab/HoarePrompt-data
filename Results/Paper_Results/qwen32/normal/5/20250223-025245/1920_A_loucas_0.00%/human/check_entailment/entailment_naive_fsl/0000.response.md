Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are a few reasons and a counterexample:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Number of Valid Integers**:
   - The program is supposed to count the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints, but it only finds one such integer and breaks out of the loop.
   - Specifically, the line `num = i` and `break` inside the loop only assigns the first valid integer found and then exits, which is incorrect.

2. **Handling of Constraints**:
   - The program calculates the range between `max(big)` and `min(less)`, which is correct for identifying the possible range of `k`.
   - However, it does not properly count all integers in this range that do not appear in the `no` list.

3. **Output**:
   - The program should output the count of valid integers for each test case, but it outputs a single integer (the first valid integer found) instead.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
The expected output is `7` because the valid integers `k` are `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`.

However, the provided program will output `3` because it finds `3` as the first valid integer and breaks out of the loop.

### Correct Implementation:
Here's a correct implementation of the problem:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = set()  # Using a set for faster lookup
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.add(a)
        low = max(big)
        high = min(less)
        count = 0
        for i in range(low, high + 1):
            if i not in no:
                count += 1
        print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This implementation correctly counts all valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints for each test case.
