Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, followed by `n` lines where each line contains two integers `a` and `x`. The integer `a` indicates the type of constraint (1: k must be greater than or equal to x, 2: k must be less than or equal to x, 3: k must not be equal to x). The function returns a value `k` that satisfies all the constraints for each test case.**
