Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is a newly input integer that must be at least 1, `a` is the newly input string, `b` is the newly input string, `c` is the newly input string, and `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` is 'NO'. At the current index `i`, if `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, then `l` is 'YES'.**
