The code snippet provided sets the variable `l` to the string `'YES'`. This assignment overrides the previous value of `l`, regardless of what it was before (which was determined by a specific condition involving the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`).

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is a newly input integer that must be at least 1, `a` is the newly input string, `b` is the newly input string, `c` is the newly input string, and `l` is 'YES'. At the current index `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.**
