Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 1, `n` is a newly input integer that must be at least 1, `a` is the newly input string, `b` is the newly input string, `c` is the newly input string, and `l` is 'YES' if `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.**
