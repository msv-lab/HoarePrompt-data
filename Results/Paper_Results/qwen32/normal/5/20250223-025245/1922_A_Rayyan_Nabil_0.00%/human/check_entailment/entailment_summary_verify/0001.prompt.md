You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. It then checks if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If such an index exists for a test case, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Logic Issue:**
   - The program iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - For each character position `i`, it checks if `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. If this condition holds for at least one position, it sets `l` to 'YES'.
   - However, the program does not ensure that the template `t` is consistent across all positions. It should check if there exists a template `t` that satisfies the conditions for all positions simultaneously.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Template Conditions:**
   - The program does not create or check a template `t` that meets the problem's requirements. It only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ from `c[i]` independently for each position, which is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.

3. **Incorrect Loop and Condition Handling:**
   - The `else` block of the `for` loop is incorrectly placed. The `else` block associated with the `for` loop will only execute if the `for` loop completes without a `break`, but even if the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` holds for one position, `l` is set to 'YES', and this should be printed immediately for that test case. The current code will always print 'NO' if the condition is not met for the last character position, regardless of previous positions.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
- For this test case, a valid template `t` could be "XYZ", where:
  - 'X' matches 'a' and 'd' (different from 'g').
  - 'Y' matches 'b' and 'e' (different from 'h').
  - 'Z' matches 'c' and 'f' (different from 'i').
- The program should output "YES" for this case, but the current implementation will output "NO".

**Correct Implementation Example:**

A correct implementation would involve checking if a valid template exists by ensuring that for each position `i`, either `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]` when the template character is uppercase, or `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different and can be matched by an uppercase template character.

Since the provided program does not handle these conditions correctly, it is incorrect.
