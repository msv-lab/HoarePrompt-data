Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. (This variable `t` is not directly relevant to the print statement involving `l`.)
- `i` is `n`, where `n` is a newly input integer.
- `a` is a newly input string.
- `b` is a newly input string.
- `c` is a newly input string.
- `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(l)
```

### Analysis:
The variable `l` is determined based on a condition involving the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. Specifically, `l` is 'YES' if there is at least one index `i` where the characters at that index in both `a` and `b` are different from the character at the same index in `c`. If no such index exists, `l` is 'NO'.

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of `l`, which is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition described above.

Output: **l (where l is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO')**
