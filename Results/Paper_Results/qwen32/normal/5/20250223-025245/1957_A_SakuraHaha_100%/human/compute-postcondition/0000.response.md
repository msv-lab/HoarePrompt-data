The code provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. After executing the code, the value of `n` will be the integer input provided, and it will replace the previous value of `n` in the initial state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the integer input provided, where 1 <= `n` <= 100.**
