Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the integer input provided, where 1 <= `n` <= 100; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is 0; `cnt` is a dictionary where the count of each unique integer in `a` is stored.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `cnt` dictionary will contain the count of each unique integer present in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged as per their initial states.
