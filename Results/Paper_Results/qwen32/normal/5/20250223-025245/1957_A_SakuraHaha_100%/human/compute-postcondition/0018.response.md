Let's break down the task step by step based on the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
2. `n` is an integer input provided, where 1 <= `n` <= 100.
3. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
4. `cnt` is a dictionary where the count of each unique integer in `a` is stored.
5. `ans` is the sum of `x // 3` for all `x` in `cnt.values()`.

### Understanding `cnt` and `ans`:
- `cnt` is a dictionary that keeps track of the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. For example, if `a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `cnt` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}`.
- `ans` is calculated as the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 3. In the example above, `ans` would be calculated as `1 // 3 + 2 // 3 + 3 // 3 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`.

### The Print Statement:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 3.

### Output Description:
Since the exact values of `a` and `cnt` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of x // 3 for all x in cnt.values())**
