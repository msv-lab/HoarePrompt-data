Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of integers and a series of queries. Each query specifies a range within the list, and the function determines whether a specific condition is met for that range. The condition checks if the number of 1s in the range, adjusted by the range's length, is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the range minus the number of 1s. The function outputs 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise.**
