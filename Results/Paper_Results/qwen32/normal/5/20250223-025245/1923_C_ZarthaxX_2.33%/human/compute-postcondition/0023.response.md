Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `q` is an input integer where \(1 \leq q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\).
- For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\).
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]` for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
- `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq l \leq r \leq n\).
- `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the range from index `l` to `r` in the `nums` list, calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'YES'`. The condition provided in the initial state, `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`, is given to be true for the given inputs. However, this condition does not affect the execution of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is independent of this condition and will always output `'YES'` regardless of the values of `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
