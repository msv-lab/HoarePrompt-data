To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions provided.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9.
- For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
- `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ `n`.
- `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the range from index `l` to `r` in the `nums` list, calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange` holds true.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NO')
```

Given the precondition, the value to be printed is explicitly stated as 'NO'. The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange` being true does not affect the output of the `print` statement since the statement directly prints 'NO' without any conditional logic.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **NO**
