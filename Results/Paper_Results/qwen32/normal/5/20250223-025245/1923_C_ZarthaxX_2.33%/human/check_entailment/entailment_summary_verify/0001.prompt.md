You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

testCases = int(input())
for i in range(testCases):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
    for _ in range(q):
        (l, r) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of integers and a series of queries. Each query specifies a range within the list, and the function determines whether a specific condition is met for that range. The condition checks if the number of 1s in the range, adjusted by the range's length, is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the range minus the number of 1s. The function outputs 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem defines a subarray as "good" if there exists an integer array `b` of the same length such that:
1. The sum of elements in `a` (the subarray) equals the sum of elements in `b`.
2. Each element in `a` is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. Each element in `b` is positive.

Given a subarray `c[l...r]`, we need to check if it can be transformed into such a "good" array `b`.

### Key Observations

1. **Sum Condition**: Since `b` must have the same sum as `a` and all elements in `b` must be positive, the sum of `a` must be at least `r - l + 1` (the length of the subarray). This is because the smallest possible sum of `r - l + 1` positive integers is `1 + 1 + ... + 1` (r - l + 1 times).

2. **Difference Condition**: For each element in `a`, the corresponding element in `b` must be different. If an element in `a` is `1`, the only positive integer we can choose for `b` that is different from `1` is at least `2`. Therefore, if the subarray `a` contains `k` ones, the sum of `b` must be at least `k * 2 + (r - l + 1 - k) = k + (r - l + 1)`. This is because we replace each `1` with `2` and each other element with at least `1`.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution uses prefix sums to efficiently compute the number of `1`s and the sum minus the number of elements in any subarray `c[l...r]`.

1. **Prefix Array `ones`**: This array keeps track of the number of `1`s up to each index in the subarray.
2. **Prefix Array `sum`**: This array keeps track of the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements up to each index. This effectively captures the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements, which is useful for checking the conditions.

For each query, the solution calculates:
- `onesInRange`: The number of `1`s in the subarray `c[l...r]`.
- `sumInRange`: The sum of the subarray `c[l...r]` minus the number of elements in this subarray.

The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` checks if the sum of `b` can be equal to the sum of `a` while satisfying the conditions:
- `2 * onesInRange`: This represents the minimum sum contribution of the `1`s in `a` when they are replaced with `2`s.
- `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange`: This represents the minimum sum contribution of the remaining elements in `a` when they are replaced with `1`s.

If this condition holds, the subarray can be transformed into a "good" array `b`.

### Conclusion

The provided solution efficiently checks the conditions for each subarray using prefix sums, and it correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good". Therefore, the solution is correct.
