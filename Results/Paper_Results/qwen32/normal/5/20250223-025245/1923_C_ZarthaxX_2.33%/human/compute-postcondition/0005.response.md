The provided code snippet updates the `ones` list based on the values in the `nums` list. Specifically, for each index `i` from 1 to `n`, `ones[i]` is set to `ones[i - 1]` plus 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise it remains the same as `ones[i - 1]`.

Given the initial state where `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers all initialized to 0, after executing the code, `ones[i]` will hold the cumulative count of 1s from the start of the `nums` list up to the `(i-1)`th element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]`; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0;**
