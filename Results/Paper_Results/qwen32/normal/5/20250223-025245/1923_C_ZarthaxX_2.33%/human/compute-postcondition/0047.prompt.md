Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `i` is `n + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `i` is `n + 1`; `q` must be greater than 0; `l` and `r` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ `n`; `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the range from index `l` to `r` in the `nums` list, calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`; `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true, then the if part is executed. Otherwise, the else part is executed. The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` determines the execution path, but the state of the variables remains consistent with the initial conditions provided in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an input integer where 0 < q ≤ 3 · 10^5 (decremented by 1); `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `i` is `n + 1`; `l` and `r` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ `n`; `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the range from index `l` to `r` in the `nums` list, calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`; `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an input integer where 0 < `q` ≤ 3 · 10^5 (decremented by 1); `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]` for all 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for all 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `n`; `i` is `n + 1`; `l` and `r` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ `n`; `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`; `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, it is not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
