The code snippet provided initializes a list named `sum` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, or `ones`. The `nums` list is not mentioned as being affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`. `nums` is a list of integers read from the input. `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0. `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0.**
