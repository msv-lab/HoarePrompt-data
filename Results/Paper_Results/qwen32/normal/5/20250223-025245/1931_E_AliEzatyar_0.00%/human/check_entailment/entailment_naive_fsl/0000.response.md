Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains multiple issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Function Name and Usage**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to count the trailing zeros in a number, but it is not defined before its usage. The program should define `func_1` before using it.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Digits**:
   - The program attempts to count the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros in each number, but it does not correctly handle the logic for determining whether Sasha wins or Anna wins.
   - The logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program subtracts the number of trailing zeros in pairs and checks if the remaining digits are sufficient to make the number greater than or equal to \(10^m\). However, this does not accurately simulate the game rules, which involve reversing digits and concatenating numbers.

3. **Incorrect Winner Determination**:
   - The program incorrectly checks `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` to determine the winner. This logic does not correctly simulate the game rules. The correct approach would involve simulating the game moves and checking if the final number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).

4. **Typographical Error**:
   - The program prints `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'` in one of the conditions, which is a typo.

5. **Handling Leading Zeros**:
   - The problem description mentions that leading zeros are removed when reversing digits, but the program does not handle this correctly. The program only counts trailing zeros, which is not sufficient to determine the correct number after reversing.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when all numbers are single digits, when there are multiple zeros, or when the numbers are already large enough to satisfy the condition without any moves.

Here is an example that demonstrates the incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Program Output:**
```
Anna
```

In this example, Anna can reverse the integer `2` to `2`, and then Sasha can concatenate `2` and `14` to get `214`, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). However, the program incorrectly determines that Anna wins.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
