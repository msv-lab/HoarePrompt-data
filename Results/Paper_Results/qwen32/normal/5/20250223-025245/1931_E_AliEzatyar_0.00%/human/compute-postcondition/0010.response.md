Postcondition: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one test case, and `i` remains `len(num) - 2`. If `num[i]` is '0', then `counter` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `counter` retains its original value, which is 1 if `num[i]` is '0', otherwise 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
