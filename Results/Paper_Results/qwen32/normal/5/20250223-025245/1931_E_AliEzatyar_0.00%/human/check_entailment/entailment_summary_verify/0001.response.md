### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Recap:
- **Anna's Move**: Reverses the digits of a number, removing leading zeros.
- **Sasha's Move**: Concatenates two chosen numbers in any order.
- **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if the final number is \(\ge 10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Count Total Digits**: The program correctly sums up the total number of digits in all numbers.
2. **Count Trailing Zeros**: The function `func_1` counts the number of trailing zeros in a number. This is not what Anna's move does. Anna reverses the digits and removes leading zeros, not trailing zeros.
3. **Sort and Subtract Zeros**: The program sorts the counts of trailing zeros in descending order and subtracts every second count from the total digits. This logic is flawed because:
   - It doesn't account for the actual effect of Anna's move on the smallest possible starting digit.
   - It incorrectly assumes that subtracting every second count of trailing zeros will lead to the correct determination of the final number.
4. **Comparison**: The program compares the adjusted total digits minus the subtracted zeros to \(m + 1\) to determine the winner. This comparison is based on incorrect logic.

### Key Issues:
- **Incorrect Counting**: The function `func_1` counts trailing zeros, which is not relevant to Anna's move.
- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic of subtracting every second count of trailing zeros and comparing it to \(m + 1\) does not correctly simulate the game's outcome under optimal play.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the winner correctly, we need to simulate the game's optimal play:
- **Anna's Optimal Play**: Reverse the digits to minimize the number.
- **Sasha's Optimal Play**: Concatenate numbers to maximize the number.

The program's current logic does not simulate these optimal strategies accurately. Instead, it relies on a flawed heuristic that does not account for the actual game mechanics.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine the winner based on optimal play by both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
