The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. It checks if there exists a pair of consecutive elements in the list `p` such that `p[i] = i + 2` and `p[i + 1] = i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`.
