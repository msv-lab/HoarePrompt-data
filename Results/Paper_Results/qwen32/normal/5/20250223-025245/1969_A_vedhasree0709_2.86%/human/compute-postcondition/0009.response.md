Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a list of integers; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
