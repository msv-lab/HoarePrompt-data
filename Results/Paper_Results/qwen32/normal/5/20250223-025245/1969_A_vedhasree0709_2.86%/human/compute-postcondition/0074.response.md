To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the `while` loop:
```
while i <= n - 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 1
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 1
- `l` is a new list of integers read from the input

Since `j`, `l`, and the conditions inside the loop body do not affect the continuation of the `while` loop, we only need to ensure that `i <= n - 1` holds true for the next iteration.

Given that `i` is currently 2, `n` must be at least 3 for the condition `i <= n - 1` to be satisfied (i.e., 2 <= 3 - 1 is false, but 2 <= 4 - 1 is true).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is at least 3.

Final State:
State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, and `l` is a new list of integers read from the input**
