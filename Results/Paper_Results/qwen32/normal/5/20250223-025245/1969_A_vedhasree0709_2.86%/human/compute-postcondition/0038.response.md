Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and the current value of `l[i]` is `i + 2` and the current value of `l[i + 1]` is `i + 1` if the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is true. Otherwise, `j` remains 0, `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input without any changes.**
