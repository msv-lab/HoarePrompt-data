The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `l`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, while `l` is newly assigned the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
