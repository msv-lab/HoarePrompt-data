The value of `i` is explicitly set to `0`. The values of `j`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input.
Output State: **`j` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input.**
