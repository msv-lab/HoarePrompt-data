The `print(2)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The integer `2` is explicitly provided as the argument to the `print` function.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides details about variables `t`, `n`, `l`, and `i`, but these are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `2`.

Therefore, the output will be the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
