The code snippet `j = 1` sets the variable `j` to the value 1. The initial state specifies that `j` is already 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, and `l` is a new list of integers read from the input. Since `j` is explicitly set to 1 in the code, and this is the same as its initial value, the state of `j` does not change. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, and `l` is a new list of integers read from the input.**
