Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, the current value of `l[i]` is `i + 2`, and the current value of `l[i + 1]` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `j`, `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
