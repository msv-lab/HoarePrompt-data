To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `i <= n - 1`. The variables involved in this condition are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- `j` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input

The loop will execute if `i <= n - 1`. Since `i` is 0, for the loop to execute, `0 <= n - 1` must be true. This simplifies to `n` being greater than or equal to 1.

No other variables (`j` or `l`) are involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified such that `n` is at least 1.

State: **`j` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
