Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is `curr` + `i` - `last`, and `i` is not equal to 0.**

In simpler terms, the value of `curr` has been updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last`. All other variables retain their initial values.
