The code snippet assigns the last element of the list `nums` to the variable `last`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, while `last` is now equal to the last element of `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `last` is the last element of `nums`.**
