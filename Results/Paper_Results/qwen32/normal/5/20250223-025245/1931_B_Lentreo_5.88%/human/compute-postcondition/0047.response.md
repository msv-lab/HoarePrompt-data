Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is the newly input list of integers, `last` is `nums[-1]`, and `curr` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `curr` has been set to 0 by the code snippet. All other variables retain their original values as described in the initial state.
