The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last element of `nums`, and `last` was also the last element of `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `nums` must have more elements to iterate over. Therefore, `i` should be the next element in `nums`.

Let's denote the next element in `nums` as `next_element`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `next_element`.

Since `last` is the last element of `nums` from the previous iteration, it should now be updated to `i` (which was the last element in the previous iteration).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `last` is `i` (the last element of `nums` from the previous iteration), `i` is `next_element` (the next element in `nums`)**

However, since we don't have a specific variable for `next_element` in the original state, we can just denote it as the next element in the list after `last`. Therefore, the state can be expressed as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `last` is the current `i` from the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in `nums`**
