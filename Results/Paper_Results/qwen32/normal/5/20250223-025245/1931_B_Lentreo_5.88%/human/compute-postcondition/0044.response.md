Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is the input list of integers, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all `i` in `nums` that are not equal to 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list. If `curr` is 0, then no additional changes are made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input provided. All other variables (`t`, `nums`, `last`, `curr`) remain unchanged.
