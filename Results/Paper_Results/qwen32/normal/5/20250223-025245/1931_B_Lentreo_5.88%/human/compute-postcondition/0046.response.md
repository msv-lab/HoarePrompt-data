The code snippet provided updates the value of the variable `last` to be the last element of the list `nums`. This means that the previous value of `last` is now replaced by the new last element of the list `nums`.

Given that:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is the newly input list of integers.
- `last` was previously the last element of the new `nums`.
- `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all `i` in the new `nums` that are not equal to 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list. If `curr` is 0, then no additional changes are made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.

The updated value of `last` will be `nums[-1]`, which is the last element of the list `nums`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is the newly input list of integers, `last` is `nums[-1]`, and `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all `i` in the new `nums` that are not equal to 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list. If `curr` is 0, then no additional changes are made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.**
