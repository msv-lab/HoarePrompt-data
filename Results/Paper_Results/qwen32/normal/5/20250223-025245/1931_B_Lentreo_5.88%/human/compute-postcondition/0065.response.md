Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a value for each test case based on the input list `a`. Specifically, for each test case, the function calculates and returns the integer value that each element in the list `a` should be equal to if the sum of the elements in `a` is evenly distributed among all elements (i.e., the average of the elements in `a`).**
