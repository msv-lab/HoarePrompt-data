The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of those elements to an integer, and then stores them in the list `nums`. This operation overwrites the previous value of `nums` with the newly read list of integers. The variables `t`, `n`, `last`, and `curr` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is the accumulated sum of differences `i - last` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`. If `curr` is 0, no additional changes are made to `curr`. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.**
