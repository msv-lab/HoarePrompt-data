Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is the input list of integers, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all `i` in `nums` that are not equal to 0, where `last` is the previous element in the list. Additionally, `curr` is not equal to 0.**
