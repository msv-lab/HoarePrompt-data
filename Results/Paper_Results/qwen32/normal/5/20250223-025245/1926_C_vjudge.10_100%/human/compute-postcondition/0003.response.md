To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, inf)`. The variables involved are `i` and `inf`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and will increment `i` by 1 in each iteration. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 1 to begin the first iteration.
2. **Variable `inf`**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `inf`. Since `inf` is set to 200001, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 200001. Therefore, `inf` does not need to be adjusted; it is already set to a value that allows the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure the loop starts correctly. The value of `t` (number of test cases) and `values` (a list of 200001 zeros) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1**
