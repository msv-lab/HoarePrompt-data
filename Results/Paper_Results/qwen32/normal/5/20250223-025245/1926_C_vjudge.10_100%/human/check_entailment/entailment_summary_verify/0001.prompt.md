You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by precomputing the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 2 * 10^5. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `inf` is set to 2 * 10^5 + 1 to accommodate the largest possible value of `n`.
   - `values` is an array initialized with zeros, where `values[i]` will eventually hold the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program iterates over every integer `i` from 1 to `inf - 1`.
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits (`sum_value_digits`).
   - It then updates `values[i]` to be the cumulative sum of digit sums up to `i`, which is `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `value` (which is `n` for that test case).
   - It then prints `values[value]`, which is the precomputed cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `value`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness**: The program correctly precomputes the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers up to 2 * 10^5. When processing each test case, it simply looks up the precomputed value, ensuring that each test case is handled efficiently.
- **Efficiency**: Precomputing the cumulative sums ensures that each test case can be handled in constant time, O(1), after the initial O(n) precomputation. Given the constraints (up to 10^4 test cases and n up to 2 * 10^5), this approach is efficient and well within the time limit of 0.5 seconds.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and efficient for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
