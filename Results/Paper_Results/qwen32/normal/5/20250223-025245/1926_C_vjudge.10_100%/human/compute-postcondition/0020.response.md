The code snippet provided is `sum_value_digits += int(x)`. This line of code increments the variable `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. However, the initial state provided does not specify what `x` is. Therefore, we can only describe the change in terms of `x`.

Since `sum_value_digits` is initially `0` and it is incremented by `int(x)`, the new value of `sum_value_digits` will be `int(x)`. The other variables in the initial state (`t`, `inf`, `values`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t`, `i` is 3, `sum_value_digits` is `int(x)`**.
