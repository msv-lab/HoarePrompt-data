### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program to understand its logic and correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `inf` is set to `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1` (which is 200001), representing the maximum possible value of `n` plus one.
   - `t` is read from the input, representing the number of test cases.
   - `values` is initialized as a list of 200001 zeros. This list will store the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i` for each index `i`.

2. **Pre-computation**:
   - A loop runs from 1 to `inf-1` (i.e., 1 to 200000).
   - For each number `i`, the sum of its digits is computed and added to the cumulative sum stored in `values[i-1]`.
   - The result is stored in `values[i]`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each of the `t` test cases, the value of `n` is read.
   - The precomputed cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `n` is printed from the `values` list.

### Analysis:

- **Pre-computation**:
  - The pre-computation step ensures that for any `n` up to 200000, the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n` can be retrieved in constant time.
  - This is efficient because the loop runs a maximum of 200000 times, which is feasible within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.

- **Processing Test Cases**:
  - Since the cumulative sums are precomputed, each test case is processed in constant time by simply looking up the value in the `values` list.
  - This is efficient and ensures that the program can handle up to 10^4 test cases within the time limit.

- **Correctness of Pre-computation**:
  - The logic for computing the sum of the digits of each number and storing the cumulative sum is correct.
  - The cumulative sum is correctly built by adding the sum of the digits of the current number to the cumulative sum of the previous numbers.

### Conclusion:

The program is correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. It efficiently pre-computes the required cumulative sums and processes each test case in constant time.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
