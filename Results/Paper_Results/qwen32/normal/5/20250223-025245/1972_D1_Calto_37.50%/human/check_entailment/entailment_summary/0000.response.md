Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The description and code match, and the function works correctly for this purpose.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\) and calculates \(x\) and \(y\) using the formulas \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then increments `cnt` by \(x // y\) and adds an additional 1 if \(i > 1\).
   - If `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

However, there are several issues with `func_2`:
   - The logic for counting valid pairs does not align with the problem's requirement. The provided formula does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The condition `if cnt == 0: return 1` is not justified based on the problem's constraints and does not correctly handle cases where there are no valid pairs.
   - The calculation of `x` and `y` and their usage in the loop do not correspond to the problem's requirements.

Given these issues, `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
