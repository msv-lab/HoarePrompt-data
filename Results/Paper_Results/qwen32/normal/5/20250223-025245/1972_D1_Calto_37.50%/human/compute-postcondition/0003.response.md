The code snippet assigns the value of `i * i` to the variable `y`. The values of `n`, `m`, `cnt`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt` is 0, `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `i * i`**
