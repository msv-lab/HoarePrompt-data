### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the provided program code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Program Code Analysis:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
   - Annotations confirm this: `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b` upon return.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`**
   - This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.
   - The annotations describe the state of `cnt` after the loop, but the logic inside the loop does not align with the problem's requirements.

#### Issues with `func_2`:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop runs from `1` to `m-1`. The problem requires checking pairs where \(1 \leq b \leq m\), so `m` should be included.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked. Instead, the function uses a derived formula:
   - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
   - `y = i * i`
   - `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`
   - This formula does not correspond to the problem's condition.
3. **Special Case Handling**: If `cnt` is zero, the function returns `1`. This handling is incorrect because it does not align with the problem's logic.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of variables after each step but do not validate the logic against the problem's requirements.
- The final state of `cnt` is described as `n + (m - 2) + sum((n - (k^2 - k)) // (k^2) for k in range(2, m))`, which does not match the problem's condition.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues with the loop range, the incorrect condition check, and the special case handling, the provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for all valid pairs \((a, b)\).
