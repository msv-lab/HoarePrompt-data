The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (specifically, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration), and `m` is greater than 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `m`.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`. The value of `m` remains unchanged.

The states `n`, `cnt`, `x`, and `y` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt` is `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`, `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `i * i`, `i` is `i + 1`**
