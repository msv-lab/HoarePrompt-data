Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt` is `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`, `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `i * i`**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is updated to its previous value plus the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1 if `i` is greater than 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
