Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt` is `cnt + x // y + (i > 1) + x // y + (i > 1)`, `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `i * i`, `i` is `i + 1`**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding `x // y + (i > 1)` to its previous value again. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain as specified in the initial state, except `i` has been incremented by 1.
