### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The program defines two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

However, upon analyzing `func_2(n, m)`, it does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to count the valid pairs. The formula used in `func_2` does not directly relate to the problem's condition that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution:
- The problem requires checking each pair \((a, b)\) to see if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The provided `func_2` function does not perform this check. Instead, it uses a formula involving \(n\), \(m\), and sums of certain expressions, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
Given the discrepancy between the problem requirements and the provided solution, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
