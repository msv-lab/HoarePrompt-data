To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `m`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6
- `m` is greater than 1
- `cnt` is `cnt + x // y + (i > 1) + x // y + (i > 1)`
- `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`
- `y` is `i * i`
- `i` is `i + 1`

We need to adjust the state for the next iteration. Specifically, we need to adjust `i` and ensure that `m` remains unchanged since it defines the loop's boundary.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Adjust `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration.
2. **Ensure `m` remains unchanged:** `m` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

### Calculation of `i` for the next iteration:
Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `i + 1`

State at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is `i` (from the end of the previous iteration before it was incremented)

### Final State:
Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration is the value it had before the increment. Therefore, if `i` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `i - 1` at the start of the next iteration.

However, since we are only adjusting based on the loop head and `i` is already incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `i` (from the end of the previous iteration)**

But to be precise in terms of the next value of `i`:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1` (from the end of the previous iteration)**

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `i` (from the end of the previous iteration before increment)**

So the correct state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `i` (from the end of the previous iteration before increment)**

But to reflect the next value of `i` correctly:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`**

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`**
