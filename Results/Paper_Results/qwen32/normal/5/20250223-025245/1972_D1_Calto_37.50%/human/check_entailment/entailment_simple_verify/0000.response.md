### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Condition**: \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. **Condition**: \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The annotation correctly describes the state and the behavior of this function.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The annotation states that the loop runs from \(1\) to \(m-1\) and provides a specific formula for `cnt`:
     ```python
     cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
     ```
     where \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - The annotation suggests that the final state of `cnt` is:
     \[
     \text{cnt} = n + (m - 2) + \sum_{k=2}^{m-1} \left(\frac{n - (k^2 - k)}{k^2}\right)
     \]
   - However, this formula does not align with the problem's requirement of counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correctness of `func_2(n, m)`:
- The logic inside `func_2(n, m)` does not correctly implement the problem's requirement.
- The loop should iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The provided code does not do this and instead uses a formula that does not match the problem's condition.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
- The explanation provided in the original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
