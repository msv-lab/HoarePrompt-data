The code snippet assigns the value of `n - (i * i - i)` to the variable `x`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `cnt` remains 0. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so `x` will be calculated based on whatever value `i` holds.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt` is 0, `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`**.
