The value of `x` is calculated as `n - (i * i - i)`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, but `i` is updated to `i + 1` before the calculation, so the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`**.
