You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`; `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters and returns their greatest common divisor.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: cnt is `n + (m - 2) + sum((n - (k^2 - k)) // (k^2) for k in range(2, m))`
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `cnt` is `n + (m - 2) + sum((n - (k^2 - k)) // (k^2) for k in range(2, m))`, and `cnt` is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns `cnt`, which is calculated as `n + (m - 2) + sum((n - (k^2 - k)) // (k^2) for k in range(2, m))` and is not equal to 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two positive integer parameters `n` and `m` and calculates a value `cnt` using a specific formula. If `cnt` equals 0, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the calculated value of `cnt`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions specified in the problem description. Let's analyze the given code and the problem requirements in detail:

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Condition**: \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. **Condition**: \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Provided Code:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\). However, the logic in this function is incorrect.

### Issues in `func_2(n, m)`:
- The loop runs from \(1\) to \(m-1\), but it should run from \(1\) to \(m\) to include all possible values of \(b\).
- The logic inside the loop (`x = n - (i * i - i)`, `y = i * i`, `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`) does not correctly implement the logic to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Example usage:
# print(count_valid_pairs(1, 1))  # Output: 1
# print(count_valid_pairs(2, 3))  # Output: 3
# print(count_valid_pairs(3, 5))  # Output: 4
# print(count_valid_pairs(10, 8))  # Output: 14
# print(count_valid_pairs(100, 1233))  # Output: 153
# print(count_valid_pairs(1000000, 1145141))  # Output: 1643498
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
