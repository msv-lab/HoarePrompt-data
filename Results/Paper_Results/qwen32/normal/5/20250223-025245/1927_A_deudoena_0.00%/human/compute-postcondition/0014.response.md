The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `ind1`. The value of `i` is 2, so `ind1` will also be 2. The other variables (`inpstr`, `j`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`inpstr` is a string containing the integer `t`, `i` is 2, `j` is the third character of `inpstr`, `ind1` is 2**.
