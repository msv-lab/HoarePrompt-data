Output State: **`inpstr` is a string containing the integer `t`, `i` is 1, `j` is the second character of `inpstr`, `ind1` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of `inpstr`, `i`, `j`, or `ind1`. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the values remain as they were in the initial state, except that we are now breaking out of the loop or if statement.
