The value of `ind1` is set to the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of `inpstr`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The condition that affects `ind1` (whether `j` is 'B') is not altered by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`inpstr` is a string containing the integer `t`, `i` is 1, `j` is the second character of `inpstr`, `ind1` is 1. If `j` is equal to 'B', then `ind1` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ind1` and the loop or if statement continues.**
