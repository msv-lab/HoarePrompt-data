The code snippet `list1 = b.split()` takes the input string `b` and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This means `list1` will now contain the words or numbers from `b` as separate elements in the list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- `a` is an integer
- `num` is a string representing an integer greater than 0
- `out` is an empty list
- `list2` is an empty list
- `list1` is an empty list
- `b` is the input string provided by the user

After executing `list1 = b.split()`, the value of `list1` changes to be a list of the substrings from `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is an integer, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is a list of substrings from the input string `b`.**
