The code snippet provided only initializes an empty list named `list2`. It does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `out`). Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the addition of the `list2` variable.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list**.
