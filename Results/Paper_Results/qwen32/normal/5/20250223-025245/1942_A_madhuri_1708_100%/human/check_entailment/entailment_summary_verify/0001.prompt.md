You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a number of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints a sequence of numbers based on the conditions: if `k` is at least 2 and `n` equals `k`, it prints `k` repeated `k` times; if `k` is at least 2 and `n` does not equal `k`, it prints `-1`; if `k` is less than 2, it prints numbers from 1 to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Sorted Array Definition**: An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
2. **Cyclic Shift**: For a given array `a`, the `x`-th cyclic shift is defined as `a_x, a_{x+1}, ..., a_n, a_1, ..., a_{x-1}`.
3. **Objective**: Find an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted.
4. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for each `1 <= i <= n`.
   - `1 <= k <= n <= 10^3`.
   - The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `10^3`.
5. **Output**: If such an array exists, print it; otherwise, print `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided Python program processes multiple test cases. For each test case with given `n` and `k`, it attempts to determine if a valid array exists and prints it or `-1` if no such array exists.

#### Case 1: `k >= 2`
- **Sub-case 1**: `n == k`
  - The program constructs an array of length `n` where all elements are equal to `k`. This array will have exactly `n` (which equals `k`) sorted cyclic shifts because all cyclic shifts are identical.
  - **Example**: `n = 3, k = 3`, array `[3, 3, 3]` has all 3 cyclic shifts sorted.
- **Sub-case 2**: `n != k`
  - The program outputs `-1` because if `n > k`, it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts with all elements being equal. If `n < k`, it's invalid as `k` cannot be greater than `n`.
  - **Example**: `n = 3, k = 2`, no valid array can have exactly 2 out of 3 cyclic shifts sorted if all elements are the same.

#### Case 2: `k < 2`
- The program constructs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This array is sorted, and its only sorted cyclic shift is the array itself.
  - **Example**: `n = 3, k = 1`, array `[1, 2, 3]` has only 1 sorted cyclic shift.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the cases where `k >= 2` and `k < 2`:
- For `k >= 2` and `n == k`, it correctly outputs an array with all elements equal to `k`.
- For `k >= 2` and `n != k`, it correctly outputs `-1`.
- For `k < 2`, it correctly outputs the sorted array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Therefore, the program is correct.
