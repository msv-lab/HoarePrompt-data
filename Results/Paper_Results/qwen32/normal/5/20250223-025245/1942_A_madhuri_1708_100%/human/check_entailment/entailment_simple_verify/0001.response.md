Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the program code to determine if the program is correct. We will use the annotated code to validate or challenge the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted. The array must satisfy:
- `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for each `1 <= i <= n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^3`.
- The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `10^3`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program processes each test case with `n` and `k`:
- If `k >= 2`:
  - If `n == k`, it outputs an array where all elements are equal to `k`.
  - If `n != k`, it outputs `-1`.
- If `k < 2` (i.e., `k == 1`):
  - It outputs the array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Case-by-Case Evaluation:
#### Case 1: `k >= 2`
- **Sub-case 1: `n == k`**
  - The program outputs an array where all elements are equal to `k`.
  - **Example**: For `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the array is `[3, 3, 3]`. All cyclic shifts are `[3, 3, 3]`, which are sorted.
  - **Conclusion**: This is correct.
  
- **Sub-case 2: `n != k`**
  - The program outputs `-1`.
  - **Reasoning**: It is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts if `n != k` when all elements are the same. If `n > k`, there are more shifts than required, and if `n < k`, it's invalid.
  - **Example**: For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, no valid array can have exactly 2 out of 3 cyclic shifts sorted if all elements are the same.
  - **Conclusion**: This is correct.

#### Case 2: `k < 2` (i.e., `k == 1`)
- The program outputs the array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- **Reasoning**: The array `[1, 2, ..., n]` is sorted, and its only sorted cyclic shift is the array itself.
- **Example**: For `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the array is `[1, 2, 3]`. The only sorted cyclic shift is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- **Conclusion**: This is correct.

### Annotations:
The annotations confirm the program's behavior:
- For `k >= 2` and `n == k`, the array `[k, k, ..., k]` is printed.
- For `k >= 2` and `n != k`, `-1` is printed.
- For `k < 2`, the array `[1, 2, ..., n]` is printed.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly handles all cases based on the annotations and reasoning provided. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
