To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's break down the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the observed output states after the first three iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The loop reads from the input file starting from the second line (since the first line contains `t`, the number of test cases).
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - If `k >= 2`:
     - If `n == k`, it prints a list of `k` elements, each being `k`.
     - If `n != k`, it prints `-1`.
   - If `k < 2`, it prints a list of `n` elements, each being `j + 1` for `j` in `range(n)`.

### Output State after All Iterations:
- The loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the output will be determined based on the values of `n` and `k` read from the input file.
- The values of `n` and `k` for each test case are independent of each other.

### Final Output State:
The final output state will be a series of outputs corresponding to each test case. Each output is determined by the conditions described above.

### Natural Language Description:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will be a sequence of printed results, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case, the output will be:
- A list of `k` elements, each being `k`, if `k >= 2` and `n == k`.
- `-1`, if `k >= 2` and `n != k`.
- A list of `n` elements, each being `j + 1` for `j` in `range(n)`, if `k < 2`.

### Final Output State Format:
Output State: **the sequence of printed results for each test case as described above.**

Since the exact input values are not provided, we can't give a concrete sequence of printed results. However, the format and conditions for each test case's output are clearly defined.

### Final Answer:
Output State: **a sequence of printed results for each test case based on the conditions provided in the loop.**
