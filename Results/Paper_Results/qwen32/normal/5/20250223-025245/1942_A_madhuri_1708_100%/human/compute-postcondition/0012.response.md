The code snippet reads a line from the input file, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` are now updated based on the values provided in the input file's next line. The conditions regarding the initial values of `n` and `k` are no longer relevant since `n` and `k` are reassigned.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the next line of the input file, `t` is at least 2, and `s` is the next line from the input file.**
