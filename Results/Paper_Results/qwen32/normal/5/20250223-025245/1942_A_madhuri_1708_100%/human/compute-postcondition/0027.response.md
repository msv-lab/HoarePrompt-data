The function `func` accepts a parameter `t` which is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 1000. Based on the values of `n` and `k`, the function performs some computation and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. It then computes and returns a result for each test case based on the provided values of `n` and `k`.**
