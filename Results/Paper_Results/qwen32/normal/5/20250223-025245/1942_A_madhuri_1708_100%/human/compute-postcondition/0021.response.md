The `print` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, `t`, or `s`. The statement simply prints the string `'-1'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, and `s`), but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet.
2. The code snippet contains only a `print` statement that outputs the string `'-1'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the described variables, the output will be exactly the string `'-1'`.

Output: **-1**
