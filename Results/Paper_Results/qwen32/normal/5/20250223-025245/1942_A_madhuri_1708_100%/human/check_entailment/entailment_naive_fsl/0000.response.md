Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate a valid array for certain values of `n` and `k` that should have a solution. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Case when `k == 1`**:
   - The program correctly generates an array `[1, 2, ..., n]` which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the array itself).
   - Example: For `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the output is `1 2 3`, which is correct.

2. **Case when `k >= 2` and `k == n`**:
   - The program correctly generates an array with all elements equal to `k`, which results in all cyclic shifts being sorted.
   - Example: For `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the output is `3 3 3`, which is correct.

3. **Case when `k >= 2` and `k < n`**:
   - The program outputs `-1` for these cases, which is incorrect.
   - There are valid arrays that can have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k < n`.
   - Example: For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the program outputs `-1`, but a valid array would be `[1, 2, 1]` which has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2]`.

To summarize, the program does not handle the case where `k >= 2` and `k < n` correctly. It should be able to generate an array that satisfies the conditions for these cases, but it currently outputs `-1` for them, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
