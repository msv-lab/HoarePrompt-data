The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'-1'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of `'-1'` is explicitly defined in the code and does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(s1)`, which means `n` is an integer derived from the string `s1`.
2. The variable `k` is assigned the value of `int(s2)`, which means `k` is an integer derived from the string `s2`.
3. There are at least two lines in the input file, meaning `t` (the number of test cases or lines) is at least 2.
4. The variable `k` is greater than or equal to 2.
5. The variable `n` is not equal to `k`.

Despite the above conditions, the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'-1'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **-1**
