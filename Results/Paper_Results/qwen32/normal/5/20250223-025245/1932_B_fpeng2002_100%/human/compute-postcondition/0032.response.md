The provided code snippet updates the `nums` list by converting space-separated input values into integers. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the `nums` list will now hold the newly input integers, and `start_year` will still be the least common multiple (LCM) of the original `nums` list (before the input was taken).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is at least 0; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers; `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original integers in the `nums` list.**
