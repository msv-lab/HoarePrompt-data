The code snippet updates the `nums` list by reading a new set of space-separated integers from the input and converting them to a list of integers. The other variables (`t`, `num_tests`, `n`, `start_year`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0 and is now `num_tests - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers; `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the previous `nums`.**
