The code snippet updates the value of `start_year` based on the value of `nums[x]`. Given that `start_year` is initially 0, the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` simplifies to `nums[x]` because `0 // nums[x]` is 0, and thus `(0 + 1) * nums[x]` is `nums[x]`.

The values of `t`, `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is a positive integer and is now reduced by 1 from its initial value; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 integer; `start_year` is `nums[x]`; `x` is 0**.
