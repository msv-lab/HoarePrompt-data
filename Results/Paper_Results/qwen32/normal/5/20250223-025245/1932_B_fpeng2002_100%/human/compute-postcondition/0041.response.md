To determine the output of the print statement `print(start_year)`, let's break down the given information step by step.

### Given Information:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. `num_tests` is at least 0.
3. `n` is the input integer.
4. `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting space-separated input values to integers.
5. `start_year` is defined as the smallest multiple of `nums[-1]` that is greater than or equal to the result of some previous operations, effectively the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `nums`.

### Key Points to Understand:
- The variable `start_year` is described as the LCM of the list `nums`. The LCM of a list of integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the integers in the list.
- The exact value of `start_year` depends on the values in the list `nums`.

### Output Determination:
Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the numerical value of `start_year`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated LCM of the list `nums`.

### Final Output:
Output: **start_year (where start_year is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the list `nums`)**
