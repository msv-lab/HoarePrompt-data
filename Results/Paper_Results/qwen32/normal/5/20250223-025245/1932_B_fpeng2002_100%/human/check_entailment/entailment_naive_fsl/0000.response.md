Let's analyze the provided program and check if it adheres to the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. There are `n` signs of the apocalypse.
2. The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.
3. The signs must occur sequentially.
4. If the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the tribe starts waiting for the (i+1)-th sign from year `x+1`.
5. We need to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs using a loop that iteratively computes the next occurrence year for each sign.

### Logic in the Code:
- `start_year` is initialized to 0.
- For each sign, the next occurrence year is calculated as `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
- This formula ensures that the next sign occurs in the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.

### Verification:
Let's verify the code with the provided example and check for any potential edge cases.

#### Example Verification:
1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
   - Calculation:
     - Start Year = 0
     - First Sign: `(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - Second Sign: `(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
     - Third Sign: `(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
     - Fourth Sign: `(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
     - Fifth Sign: `(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
     - Sixth Sign: `(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
   - Calculation:
     - Start Year = 0
     - First Sign: `(0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
     - Second Sign: `(1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
     - Third Sign: `(2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - Fourth Sign: `(3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
     - Fifth Sign: `(4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
   - Calculation:
     - Start Year = 0
     - First Sign: `(0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
     - Second Sign: `(1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
     - Third Sign: `(2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
     - Fourth Sign: `(3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
     - Fifth Sign: `(4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
   - Calculation:
     - Start Year = 0
     - First Sign: `(0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
     - Second Sign: `(50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
     - Third Sign: `(60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
     - Fourth Sign: `(711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
     - Fifth Sign: `(800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
     - Sixth Sign: `(1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
   - Output: `2012` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs for the provided examples and adheres to the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases that the program does not handle correctly based on the logic provided.

**Correctness: True**. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens for every potential case based on the problem description.
