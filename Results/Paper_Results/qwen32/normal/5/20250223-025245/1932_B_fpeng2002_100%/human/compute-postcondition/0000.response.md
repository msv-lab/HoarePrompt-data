The code snippet `num_tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. The variable `t` from the initial state is not affected by this code snippet. The values of `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are also not affected as they are not mentioned in the provided code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is the input integer.**
