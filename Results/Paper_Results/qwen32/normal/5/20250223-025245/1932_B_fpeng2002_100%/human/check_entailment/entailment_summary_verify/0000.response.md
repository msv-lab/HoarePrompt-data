### Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The `start_year` is initialized to 0, which is appropriate since the first sign's occurrence is calculated from year 0.

2. **Iterative Calculation**: For each sign, the program calculates the next occurrence year using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula ensures that the next sign occurs in the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`. This is critical because it ensures that the signs occur sequentially, starting from the year immediately after the previous sign's occurrence.

3. **Verification with Examples**:
   - **First Test Case**: The calculations match the expected output (36).
   - **Second Test Case**: The calculations match the expected output (5).
   - **Third Test Case**: The calculations match the expected output (5).
   - **Fourth Test Case**: The calculations match the expected output (2012).

4. **Function Summary**: The function summary states that the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list. However, the program does not actually calculate the LCM of all the numbers. Instead, it calculates the sequential occurrence of each sign based on the previous sign's occurrence year, which is the correct approach as per the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**: The original assessment did not explicitly mention edge cases, but the program handles cases where all periodicities are 1 (as in the third test case) and cases with larger periodicities (as in the fourth test case) correctly.

Given the above points, the program adheres to the problem description and correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description.

**Final: True**
