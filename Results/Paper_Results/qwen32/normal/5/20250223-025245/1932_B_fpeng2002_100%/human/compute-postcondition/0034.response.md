The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the result of `len(nums)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `len(nums)` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `x` is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts since it will be initialized by the `range` function.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is at least 0; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 integer; `start_year` is 0**
