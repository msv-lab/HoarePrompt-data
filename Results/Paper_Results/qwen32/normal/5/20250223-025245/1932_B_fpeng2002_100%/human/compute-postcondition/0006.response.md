Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is a positive integer and is now reduced by 1 from its initial value; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers; `start_year` is 0.**

In simple terms, after the code execution, the variable `start_year` is set to 0. All other variables (`t`, `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`) retain their initial state values.
