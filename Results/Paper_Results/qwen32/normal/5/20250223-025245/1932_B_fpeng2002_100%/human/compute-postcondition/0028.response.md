Let's break down the given initial state and determine what will be printed by the `print(start_year)` statement.

1. **t**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. This variable indicates the number of test cases. However, it is not directly relevant to the `start_year` calculation in the current context.

2. **num_tests**: This variable is decremented by 1 (`num_tests = num_tests - 1`). This suggests it is used to keep track of the number of remaining test cases. It is not directly relevant to the `start_year` calculation.

3. **n**: An integer input value. This likely indicates the number of elements in the `nums` list.

4. **nums**: A list of integers obtained by converting space-separated input values to integers. The exact values of these integers are not provided, so we can only describe `start_year` in terms of these integers.

5. **start_year**: This variable is calculated as the least common multiple (LCM) of all the integers in the `nums` list.

Given the above, the `print(start_year)` statement will output the least common multiple of the integers in the `nums` list.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the least common multiple of the integers in the `nums` list)**
