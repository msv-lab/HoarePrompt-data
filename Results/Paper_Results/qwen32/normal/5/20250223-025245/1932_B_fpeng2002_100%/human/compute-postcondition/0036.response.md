The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `nums`. Since the loop iterates over the indices of `nums`, `x` is the current index being processed. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `x` by 1. The variable `nums` remains unchanged as it is the list being iterated over.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the current index and `nums` is the list of integers. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than the length of `nums`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is at least 0; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 integer; `start_year` is `nums[x]`

To start the next iteration:
- Increment `x` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is at least 0; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 integer; `x` is `x + 1`**
