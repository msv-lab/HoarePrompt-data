Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0 and is now `num_tests - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers; `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `nums`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `num_tests` has decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
