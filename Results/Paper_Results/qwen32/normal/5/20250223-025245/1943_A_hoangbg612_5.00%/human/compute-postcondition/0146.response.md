The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `M[i]` and `cur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`; `cur` is equal to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
