The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the index `cur` in the list `M`. Given that `cur` is `num_next`, the value at index `num_next` in the list `M` is now `1`.

The other variables (`N`, `T`, `S`, `num`, `cur`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `num` is `num_next`, `cur` is `num_next`, `M[num_next]` is `1`.**
