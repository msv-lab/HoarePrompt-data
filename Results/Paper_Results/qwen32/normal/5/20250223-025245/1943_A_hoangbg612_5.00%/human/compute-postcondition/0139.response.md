To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop with the given conditions.

The loop iterates over each number in the sorted list `N`. The variable `cur` starts at -1, and a dictionary `M` is initialized as empty. The loop updates `cur` and `M` based on the comparison of the current number `num` with `cur`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `cur` is initialized to -1.
   - `M` is initialized as an empty dictionary.

2. **First Iteration:**
   - The first number `num` in `N` is checked against `cur`.
   - If `num > cur`, `cur` is updated to `num`, and `M[num]` is set to 1.
   - If `num <= cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 (which won't happen since `cur` is initially -1 and `num` is at least the first element of `N`).

3. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - For each subsequent number `num` in `N`:
     - If `num > cur`, `cur` is updated to `num`, and `M[num]` is set to 1.
     - If `num == cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.
     - If `num < cur`, the loop breaks (though this won't happen since `N` is sorted and `num` will always be greater than or equal to `cur`).

The loop will continue until all numbers in `N` have been processed. The final state of `cur` will be the last number in `N`, and `M` will contain each unique number in `N` as a key with its value being the count of occurrences of that number in `N`.

### Final Output State:
- `N` remains the same sorted list of integers.
- `cur` will be the last element of the list `N`.
- `T` remains unchanged.
- `S` remains unchanged.
- `M` will be a dictionary where each key is a unique number from `N` and the value is the count of occurrences of that number in `N`.

Output State: **N is a sorted list of integers, cur is the last element of N, T remains unchanged, S remains unchanged, M is a dictionary with each unique number in N as keys and their counts as values.**
