The given code snippet `M[cur] += 1` increments the value at the index `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. The other variables (`N`, `T`, `S`, and `num`) are not affected by this operation.

To provide the output state, we need to consider the current state of `M[cur]`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `M[cur]`, we can assume it is an integer. After the operation, `M[cur]` will be increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `num` is `num_next`, `M[cur]` is `M[cur] + 1`.**

In natural language: The value at index `cur` in the dictionary `M` is incremented by 1. The values of `N`, `T`, `S`, and `num` remain unchanged.
