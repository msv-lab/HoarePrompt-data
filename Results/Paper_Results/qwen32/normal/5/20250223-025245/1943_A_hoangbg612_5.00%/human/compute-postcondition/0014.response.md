The code assigns the value `1` to the element in the list `M` at the index specified by the variable `cur`. Given that `cur` is equal to `num` and `num` is not greater than `cur + 1`, the only change is the update to the list `M`.

Output State: **`num` is greater than `cur`, and `cur` is equal to `num`; `M[cur]` is 1.** 

In natural language: The value at index `cur` in the list `M` is now `1`. The conditions about `num` and `cur` remain the same.
