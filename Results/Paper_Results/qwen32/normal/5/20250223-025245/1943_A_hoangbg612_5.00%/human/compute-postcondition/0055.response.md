The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list `N`. The initial state of `cur`, `T`, and `S` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`cur` is the smallest index `i` for which `M[i] <= i`, or the initial value of `cur` if no such `i` is found within the range; `T` remains unchanged; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
