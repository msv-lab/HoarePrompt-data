The value of `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. The values of `num`, `cur`, and the elements of `N` that are not `num` remain unchanged. The structure of `M` as a dictionary remains, but the count associated with the key `cur` is updated.

Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `N` that must have at least one more element, `cur` is an integer, and `M` is a dictionary with the value of `M[cur]` incremented by 1.**
