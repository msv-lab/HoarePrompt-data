Postcondition: **`cur` is the largest number in the contiguous sequence starting from -1 in N. If the sum of the counts of all numbers in M is equal to S, then `cur` is increased by 1, and M is a dictionary with counts of all numbers in this updated contiguous sequence. Otherwise, the sum of the counts of all numbers in M is not equal to S.**
