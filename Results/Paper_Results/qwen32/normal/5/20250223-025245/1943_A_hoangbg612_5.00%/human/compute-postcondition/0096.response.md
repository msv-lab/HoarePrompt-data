The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `cur`. Therefore, the value of `cur` changes from `i + 1` to `i`. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, and `M`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`cur` is `i`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.**
