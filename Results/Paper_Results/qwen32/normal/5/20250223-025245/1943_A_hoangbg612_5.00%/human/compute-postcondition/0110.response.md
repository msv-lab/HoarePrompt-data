The code snippet `cur = -1` sets the value of the variable `cur` to -1. This change does not affect the other variables `N`, `T`, `S`, or `M`. The variable `cur` is now explicitly set to -1, regardless of its previous value.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `cur` is -1; `T` remains unchanged; `S` is an input integer; `M` remains a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts.**
