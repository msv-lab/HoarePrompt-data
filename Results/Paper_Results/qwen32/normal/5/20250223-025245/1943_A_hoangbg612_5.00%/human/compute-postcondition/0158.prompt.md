Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 · 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2 · 10^4, each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a` where 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    for i in range(cur):
        if M[i] <= i:
            cur = i
            break
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is the smallest index `i` for which `M[i] <= i`, or the initial value of `cur` if no such `i` is found within the range.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is the smallest `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, or the initial value of `cur` if no such `i` is found within the range `[0, cur-1]`. `T` remains unchanged; `S` remains unchanged; `N` remains a sorted list of integers; `M` remains a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is set to the smallest `i` in the range `[0, cur - 1]` such that `M[i] <= i`, or it remains unchanged if no such `i` exists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
