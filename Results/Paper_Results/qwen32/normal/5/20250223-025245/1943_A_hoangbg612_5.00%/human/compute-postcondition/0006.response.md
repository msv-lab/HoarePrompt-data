The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary `M`. The values of the other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, and `cur`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 · 10^4; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `cur` is -1; `M` is an empty dictionary.**
