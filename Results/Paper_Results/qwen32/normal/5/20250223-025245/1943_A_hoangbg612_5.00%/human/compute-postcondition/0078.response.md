The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If `N` has more integers, the loop will execute again with the next integer in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is `num`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, and `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer. Since `num` was the last key processed in the dictionary `M`, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must have at least one more integer. The next `num` will be the next integer in the list `N`.

State: **`cur` is `num`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the next integer in the list `N`**
