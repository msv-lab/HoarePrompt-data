Output State: **`cur` is the last element in `N` or the last `num` processed before the loop breaks, incremented by 1; `T` remains unchanged; `S` remains unchanged; `N` is a sorted list of integers; `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts; the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `cur` has been increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
