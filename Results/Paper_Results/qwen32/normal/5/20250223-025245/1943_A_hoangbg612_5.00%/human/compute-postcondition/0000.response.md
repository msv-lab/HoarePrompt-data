The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 · 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2 · 10^4, each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a` where 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
