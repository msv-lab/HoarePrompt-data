Output State: **N is a sorted list of integers, cur is the last element of N incremented by 1, T remains unchanged, S remains unchanged, M is a dictionary with each unique number in N as keys and their counts as values. The sum of the counts of all keys in M equals S.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`N`, `T`, `S`, and `M`) remain unchanged.
