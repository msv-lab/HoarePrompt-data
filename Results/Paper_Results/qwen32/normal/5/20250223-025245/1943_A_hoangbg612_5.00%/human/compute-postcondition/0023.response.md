The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. The values of `num` and the condition `if num is greater than cur + 1` are not affected by this line of code. However, the dictionary `M` now includes the key `cur` with the value `1`.

Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `N`, `cur` is now equal to `num`, and `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and `1` as its value. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**
