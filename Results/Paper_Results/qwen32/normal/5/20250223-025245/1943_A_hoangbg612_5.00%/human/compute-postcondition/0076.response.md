To execute the given Python code snippet and determine the output state, let's analyze the initial state and the effect of the code on the variables.

Initial State:
- `cur` is either `num` if `num` is greater than -1, or -1 if `num` is less than or equal to -1.
- `T` remains unchanged.
- `S` remains unchanged.
- `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer.
- `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 1}` if `num` is greater than -1, or an empty dictionary if `num` is less than or equal to -1.
- `num` is the next element in `N` after the previous `num`.

The line of code to execute:
```python
M[cur] += 1
```

Effect on the variables:
- If `cur` is greater than -1, `M[cur]` will be incremented by 1. This means the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` will increase by 1.
- If `cur` is -1, this line of code will raise a KeyError because there will be no key `-1` in the dictionary `M` (since `M` is either `{num: 1}` or `{}` and `num` is greater than -1).

Since the problem statement does not specify what happens if `cur` is -1, we will assume that the precondition `cur` is greater than -1 holds true (as it aligns with the given structure of `M`).

Therefore, the value of `M[cur]` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`cur` is `num` (greater than -1), `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 2}` if `num` was the only key in `M` before, `num` is the next element in `N` after the previous `num`.**

In natural language: The value of `M[cur]` has been incremented by 1, making it 2 if `cur` was the only key in `M` before. All other variables remain unchanged.
