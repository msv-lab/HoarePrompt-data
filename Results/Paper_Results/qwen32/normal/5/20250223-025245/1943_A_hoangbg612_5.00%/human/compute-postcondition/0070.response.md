The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, which is being iterated over the sorted list `N`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the value of `num` at the end of the previous iteration and how it changes in the next iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `cur` is either `num` if `num` is greater than -1, or -1 if `num` is less than or equal to -1.
- `T` remains unchanged.
- `S` remains unchanged.
- `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer.
- `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 1}` if `num` is greater than -1, or an empty dictionary if `num` is less than or equal to -1.

Since `num` is the variable being iterated over `N`, at the start of the next iteration, `num` will take the next value in the list `N`. The values of `cur`, `T`, `S`, and `M` do not directly influence the value of `num` in the loop head; they remain unchanged except for `cur` and `M` which are dependent on `num`.

Let's denote the current value of `num` at the end of the previous iteration as `num_prev`. At the start of the next iteration, `num` will be the next element in the list `N` after `num_prev`. Since `N` is sorted and has at least one integer, there must be a next value unless `num_prev` was the last element in the list.

If `num_prev` was the last element in the list `N`, the loop would terminate, and there would be no next iteration. Therefore, we assume that `num_prev` is not the last element in the list.

State: **`cur` is either `num` if `num` is greater than -1, or -1 if `num` is less than or equal to -1, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 1}` if `num` is greater than -1, or an empty dictionary if `num` is less than or equal to -1, `num` is the next element in `N` after the previous `num`**

Since we cannot specify the exact next value of `num` without knowing `N` and `num_prev`, we express the state in terms of the next element in the list `N` after the previous `num`.

State: **`cur` is either `num` if `num` is greater than -1, or -1 if `num` is less than or equal to -1, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 1}` if `num` is greater than -1, or an empty dictionary if `num` is less than or equal to -1, `num` is the next element in `N` after the previous `num`**
