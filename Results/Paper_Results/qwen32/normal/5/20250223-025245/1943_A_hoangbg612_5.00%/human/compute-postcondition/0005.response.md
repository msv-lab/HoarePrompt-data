The code snippet assigns the value `-1` to the variable `cur`. The values of `T`, `S`, and `N` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 · 10^4; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `cur` is -1.**
