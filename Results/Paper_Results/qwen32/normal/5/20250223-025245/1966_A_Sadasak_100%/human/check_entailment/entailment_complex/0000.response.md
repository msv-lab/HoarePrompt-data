Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of cards left after performing a series of card exchanges as described. However, the current implementation of the program has several issues that prevent it from working correctly.

1. **Incorrect Handling of Frequency Table**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the frequency of each card number in the list, but it incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left. Instead, it should calculate the actual frequency of each card number.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Minimum Cards**: After obtaining the frequency table, the program checks if `k` is a value in the frequency table. If it is, the program prints `k - 1`. This logic does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards left. Instead, the program should use the frequencies to simulate the card exchanges and determine the minimum number of cards left.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when no exchanges can be made because there are not enough cards of any single number to perform an exchange.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
