Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 1 element; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary where `frequency_table[num]` is set to `k`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `frequency_table[num]` has been explicitly set to `k`, regardless of its previous value. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
