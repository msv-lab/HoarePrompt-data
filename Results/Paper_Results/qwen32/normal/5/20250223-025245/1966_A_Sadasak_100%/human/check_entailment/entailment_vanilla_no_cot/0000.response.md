Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Frequency Table**: The function `func_1` incorrectly caps the frequency of any card to `k`, which is not the correct approach. The frequency table should accurately reflect the count of each card without any capping.

2. **Incorrect Use of Frequency Table**: The main logic after creating the frequency table is incorrect. The program checks if `k` is a value in the frequency table, which is not relevant to the problem. The problem requires minimizing the number of cards based on the operations described.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**: The core logic to determine the minimum number of cards after performing the operations is missing. The correct approach would involve using the frequencies to calculate how many cards can be reduced based on the allowed operations.

To fix the program, we need to correctly calculate the minimum number of cards by considering the number of times we can perform the operation for each distinct card number. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the frequency of each card
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        # For each card number, we can reduce the count to (count % k) + 1
        # if count % k is 0, we can reduce it to k - 1 + 1 = k, which is not optimal,
        # so we should reduce it to 0 if possible, otherwise 1
        min_cards += (count % k) if (count % k) != 0 else 1
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This corrected program calculates the minimum number of cards left by considering the remainder when the frequency of each card is divided by `k`. If the remainder is zero, it means we can reduce the cards to zero (except when the count is exactly `k`), otherwise, we keep the remainder.
