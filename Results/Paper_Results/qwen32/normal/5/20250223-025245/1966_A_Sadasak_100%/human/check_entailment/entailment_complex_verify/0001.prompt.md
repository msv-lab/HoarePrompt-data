You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, and k is an integer representing the number of cards to exchange in each operation such that 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 2 <= k <= 100.
def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 1 element; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key `num` from `arr` has a value that is the minimum of the count of `num` in `arr` and `k`.
    return frequency_table
    #The program returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a number from the list `arr` and each value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique number from `arr` and each value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the integer `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Handling Edge Case (`k > n`):**
   - The program correctly identifies the edge case where `k` is greater than `n`. In this scenario, no operations can be performed, so the number of cards remains `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The program uses the function `func_1` to calculate a frequency table of the card numbers.
   - However, the function `func_1` has a critical flaw: it incorrectly caps the frequency of each number to `k`. This is not required by the problem statement. The frequency should reflect the actual count of each number in the list.

4. **Determining the Minimum Number of Cards:**
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1`. However, this logic is flawed. The correct approach involves using the frequency table to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.
   - The logic should involve reducing the counts of card numbers by multiples of `k-1` (since each operation reduces the count by `1`), and summing up the remaining counts.

### Correct Approach:
To find the minimum number of cards left:
- Calculate the actual frequency of each card number.
- For each unique card number, reduce its frequency by multiples of `k-1` (since each operation reduces the count by `1`).
- Sum up the remaining counts to get the minimum number of cards.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed frequency calculation and the incorrect logic for determining the minimum number of cards. The frequency should not be capped to `k`, and the logic for reducing the counts needs to be corrected.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
