The code snippet `frequency_table[num] = k` sets the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`. Given that `frequency_table[num]` was previously greater than `k`, it will now be exactly `k`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 1 element, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value is `k`.**
