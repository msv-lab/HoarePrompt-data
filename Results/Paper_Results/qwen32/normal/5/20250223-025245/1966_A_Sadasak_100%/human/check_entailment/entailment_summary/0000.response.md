### Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem by determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations. However, the implementation has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Logic for Reducing Cards**: The core logic for reducing the number of cards is flawed. The problem requires repeatedly exchanging groups of `k` identical cards for `k-1` cards until no more such groups can be formed. The current code does not simulate this process; instead, it incorrectly checks if `k` is in the frequency values and returns `k-1` if true, which is not a valid approach.

2. **Handling Frequencies**: The function `func_1` is supposed to help in determining the minimum number of cards left, but it only caps the frequency of each number to `k`. This does not help in determining the minimum number of cards after performing the operations.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not correctly handle cases where the number of cards `n` is less than `k`. It simply prints `n` in such cases, which is correct, but the overall logic is incorrect.

4. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy involves grouping identical cards and reducing them using the allowed operations until no more such groups can be formed. This requires a more sophisticated approach, such as using a greedy algorithm or dynamic programming, which the current code does not implement.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
