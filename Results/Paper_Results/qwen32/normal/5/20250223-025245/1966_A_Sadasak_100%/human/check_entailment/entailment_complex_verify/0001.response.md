### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
The task is to minimize the number of cards by repeatedly exchanging `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards of any numbers. The goal is to find the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing any number of such operations.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the integer `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Handling Edge Case (`k > n`):**
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, no operations can be performed, so the number of cards remains `n`. This part is correct.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates a frequency table where the frequency of each number is capped at `k`. This is incorrect because the frequency should reflect the actual count of each number, not capped at `k`.

4. **Determining the Minimum Number of Cards:**
   - After obtaining the frequency table, the program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1`. This logic is flawed. The correct approach involves reducing the counts of card numbers by multiples of `k-1` and summing up the remaining counts.

#### Correct Approach:
To find the minimum number of cards left:
- Calculate the actual frequency of each card number.
- For each unique card number, reduce its frequency by multiples of `k-1` (since each operation reduces the count by `1`).
- Sum up the remaining counts to get the minimum number of cards.

#### Validation Using Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` caps the frequency of each number to `k`, which is incorrect.
- The logic for determining the minimum number of cards is flawed, as it does not correctly simulate the card exchange operations.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed frequency calculation and the incorrect logic for determining the minimum number of cards. The frequency should not be capped to `k`, and the logic for reducing the counts needs to be corrected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
