### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the original assessment based on the problem description, the code provided, and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to minimize the number of cards by repeatedly exchanging `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards with any numbers.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing any number of such operations.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cards) and `k` (number of cards to exchange).
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Handling Edge Case (`k > n`):**
   - The program correctly identifies the edge case where `k` is greater than `n`. In this scenario, no operations can be performed, so the number of cards remains `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates a frequency table where each key is a unique card number and each value is the minimum of the count of that number in `nums` and `k`. This is incorrect because the actual count of each card number should be used, not capped to `k`.

4. **Determining the Minimum Number of Cards:**
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1`. This logic is flawed.
   - The correct approach is to reduce the counts of card numbers by multiples of `k-1` and sum up the remaining counts.

#### Correct Approach:
- Calculate the actual frequency of each card number.
- For each unique card number, reduce its frequency by multiples of `k-1`.
- Sum up the remaining counts to get the minimum number of cards.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` is described as returning a dictionary where each key is a unique number from `arr` and each value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`. This is incorrect for the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the flaws in the program. The frequency calculation is incorrect because it caps the frequency to `k`, and the logic for determining the minimum number of cards is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
