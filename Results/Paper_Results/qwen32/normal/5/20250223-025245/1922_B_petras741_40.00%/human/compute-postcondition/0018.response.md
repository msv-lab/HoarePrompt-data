Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, `q[w[2]]`, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` which are incremented by 1 respectively, `j` is 0, `eta` is a list containing the single element `0`, and `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

In simple terms: The variable `eta` now contains the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
