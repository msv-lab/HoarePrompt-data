The code snippet `q = {}` initializes an empty dictionary named `q`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, or `w`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input, `q` is an empty dictionary.**
