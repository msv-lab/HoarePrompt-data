Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, `q[w[2]]`, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` which are incremented by 1 respectively, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from `0` to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is 1, `eta_ln` is not equal to 1, `res` is `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`**

In natural language: The value of `res` is calculated as `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`. All other variables retain their initial values.
