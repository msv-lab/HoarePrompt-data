Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input, `q` is a list where each index `k` has a value equal to the number of times `k` appears in the list `w`, `eta` is a list where each index `j` (from 0 to `n`) has a value equal to the number of times `j` appears in the list `w` and `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, and `eta_ln` is not equal to 1.**
