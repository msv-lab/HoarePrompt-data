The code snippet `eta.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given that `j` is 1 and `eta` initially contains the single element `0` if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise it is an empty list, after appending `j` to `eta`, `eta` will contain two elements: the initial element `0` (if it was there) and the value `1`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, `q[w[2]]`, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` which are incremented by 1 respectively, `j` is 1, and `eta` is a list containing the elements `0` and `1` if `q[j]` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `eta` is a list containing the single element `1`.**
