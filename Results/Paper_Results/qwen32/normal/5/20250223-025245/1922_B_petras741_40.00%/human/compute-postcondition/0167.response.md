Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the input integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the new input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, then `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in the list `w`, `eta` is a list containing all unique integers from the list `w`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`. If `eta_ln` equals 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of all counts in `q` corresponding to the unique integers in `eta`. If `n` is less than 3, no additional changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, or `rho`.**
