To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change.

The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n` (inclusive), and for each `j` in this range, it checks if `q[j] > 0`. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, it appends `j` to the list `eta`.

Given the initial state and the outputs after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. `q` is a list of size `n + 1` with some elements incremented by 1 based on the values in the list `w`.
2. `eta` accumulates indices `j` where `q[j] > 0`.

After the loop completes all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n` (the last value in the range `range(n + 1)`).

The final state of `eta` will include all indices `j` from `0` to `n` where `q[j] > 0`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, `q[w[2]]`, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` which are incremented by 1 respectively, `j` is `n`, and `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from `0` to `n` where `q[j] > 0`.**

In simpler terms, `eta` will contain all the unique values from the list `w` since `q` is incremented at indices corresponding to the values in `w`.
