The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it 3.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 2, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[j]]` which is 2, `j` is 3**
