Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, `q[w[2]]`, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` which are incremented by 1 respectively, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from `0` to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `j` is `n` and `rho` is 1. If `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `j` is `eta_ln`, and `rho` is `1 + sum(q[eta[j]] for j in range(1, eta_ln))`.**
