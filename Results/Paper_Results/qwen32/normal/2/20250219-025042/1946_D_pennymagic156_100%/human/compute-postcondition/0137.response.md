Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least two elements, `t` is a list containing the elements it originally had plus `ai` if `op` was 0, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`, `ai` is `val` if `op` was 0, otherwise `ai` remains unchanged, `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `val` is the next element in `a`.**
