Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is either the return value of `func_1()` or a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it is the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0. Additionally, `v` is even and non-zero, and `v` is truthy (non-zero).
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    if not op:
        cnt += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a non-empty list containing accumulated `ai` values, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is the `i-th` bit of `val`. If `op` is 0, then `cnt` is 1 and `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` since the last time `op` was 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `ai` retains its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a non-empty list containing accumulated `ai` values, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `val` is the next element in the list `a`, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is 2 if `op` was 0 before the operation and the `i-th` bit of `val` is 1, otherwise `cnt` is 1 if `op` was not 0 before the operation or the `i-th` bit of `val` is not 1, `ai` retains its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a non-empty list containing accumulated `ai` values, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `val` is the next element in the list `a`, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `op` was initially 0, and `ai` retains its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
