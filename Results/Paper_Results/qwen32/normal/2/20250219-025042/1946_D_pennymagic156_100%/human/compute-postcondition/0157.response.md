The given code snippet increments the variable `cnt` by 1. None of the other variables are affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a non-empty list containing accumulated `ai` values, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `val` will be the next element in the list `a`, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is now `cnt + 1`, `ai` retains its previous value.**
