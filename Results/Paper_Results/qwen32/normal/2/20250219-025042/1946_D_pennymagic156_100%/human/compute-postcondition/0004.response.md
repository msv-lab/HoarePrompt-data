To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
```

Here's what happens:

- `u` is assigned the value of `(x >> i) & 1`. This means `x` is right-shifted by `i` bits, and then bitwise AND operation with `1` is performed. The result is either `0` or `1`.
- `v` is assigned the value of `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`. This means each element in `a` is right-shifted by `i` bits, then bitwise AND operation with `1` is performed, and the results are summed up.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (unchanged).
- `x` is a non-negative integer (unchanged).
- `a` is the return value of `func_1()` (unchanged).
- `t` is an empty list (unchanged).
- `ans` is -1 (unchanged).

After executing the code snippet, the new values for `u` and `v` are determined as described above.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`**.
