Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, and `v` is even. If `v` is non-zero, `ans` is `max(-1, cnt)` where `cnt` is the number of times `op` (the result of XORing all `(val >> i) & 1` for each `val` in `a`) was zero during the iterations. If `v` is zero, `ans` remains -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
