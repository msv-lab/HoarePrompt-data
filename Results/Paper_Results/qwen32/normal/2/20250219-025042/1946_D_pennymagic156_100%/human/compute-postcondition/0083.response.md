Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least one element, `u` is `(x >> 27) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `val` is `a[j+2]`, `ai` is `0`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `t` is `[a[j+1], ai, ai]` if `op` was `0` before the operation, otherwise `t` is `[ai]`**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `ai` is set to `0`. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions.
