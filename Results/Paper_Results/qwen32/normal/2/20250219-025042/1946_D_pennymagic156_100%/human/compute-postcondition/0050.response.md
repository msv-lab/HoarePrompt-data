The given code modifies the variable `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between its current value and the result of `(val >> i) & 1`. This operation updates the value of `op` based on the `i`-th bit of `val`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and must be an iterable with at least two elements.
- `t` is an empty list.
- `ans` is -1.
- `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0.
- `v` is even and non-zero.
- `op` is `op_original ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`.
- `cnt` is 2 if `op` is 0, otherwise `cnt` remains 1.
- `val` is the next element in `a`.

After executing the line `op ^= val >> i & 1`, the new value of `op` is calculated as the XOR of its current value and the `i`-th bit of `val`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and must be an iterable with at least two elements, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`, `cnt` is 2 if `op` is 0, otherwise `cnt` remains 1, `val` is the next element in `a`.**
