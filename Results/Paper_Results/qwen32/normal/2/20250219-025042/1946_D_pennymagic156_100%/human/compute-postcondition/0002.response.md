The code initializes two new variables `t` and `ans`. The variable `t` is assigned an empty list, and `ans` is assigned the value `-1`. The initial state of `n`, `x`, and `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1.**
