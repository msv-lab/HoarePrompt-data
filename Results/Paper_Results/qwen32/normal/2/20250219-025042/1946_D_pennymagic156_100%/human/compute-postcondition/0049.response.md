The only object in the loop head is the variable `val`, which iterates over the elements of the iterable `a`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `val` to be the next element in `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and must be an iterable with at least two elements.
- `t` is an empty list.
- `ans` is -1.
- `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0.
- `v` is even and non-zero.
- `op` is `op_original ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`.
- `cnt` is 2 if `op` is 0, otherwise `cnt` remains 1.
- `val` is the current element in `a`.

Since `val` is the current element in `a` and we are moving to the next iteration, `val` should be updated to the next element in `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and must be an iterable with at least two elements, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `op_original ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`, `cnt` is 2 if `op` is 0, otherwise `cnt` remains 1, `val` is the next element in `a`**.

However, since `u`, `op`, and `cnt` depend on the current `val`, they would need to be recalculated based on the new `val`. But according to the task instructions, we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which is `val` in this case.

Therefore, the final adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and must be an iterable with at least two elements, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and is not equal to 0, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `op_original ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`, `cnt` is 2 if `op` is 0, otherwise `cnt` remains 1, `val` is the next element in `a`**.
