You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Logic Error in Bitwise Operations**: The program attempts to process each bit position from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB) of `x` and `a`. However, the logic used to determine whether a segment can be formed based on the current bit position is flawed.

2. **Handling of Bitwise OR and XOR**: The program uses bitwise OR (`|`) and XOR (`^`) operations but does not correctly ensure that the cumulative XOR of segments does not exceed `x` in terms of bitwise OR. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the condition `(a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Segments**: The program tries to form segments based on the current bit position but does not correctly maintain the cumulative XOR of segments and check if the bitwise OR of these cumulative XORs is within the limit `x`.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is `0` or when the array `a` contains elements that cannot be segmented according to the problem constraints.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5 0
0 1 2 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output from Program:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of the Issue:**
- For `x = 0`, no segment can have a non-zero XOR value because the bitwise OR of any non-zero XOR value will exceed `0`.
- The program incorrectly forms a segment and returns `1` instead of `-1`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
