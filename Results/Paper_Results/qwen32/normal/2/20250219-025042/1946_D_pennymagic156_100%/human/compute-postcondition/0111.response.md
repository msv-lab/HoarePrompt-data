Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is either the return value of `func_1()` or a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> 27) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is the XOR of the 27-th bits of all elements in `a`, `ai` is the XOR of all elements in `a` if `op` never became 0; otherwise, it is the XOR of the elements since the last time `op` was 0. If `v` is odd, the state remains as described above. If `v` is even and non-zero, `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop execution, and `ans` is the maximum value between its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
