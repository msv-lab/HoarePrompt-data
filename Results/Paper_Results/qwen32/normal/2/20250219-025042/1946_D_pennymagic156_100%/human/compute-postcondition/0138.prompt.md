Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is either the return value of `func_1()` or a list containing accumulated `ai` values whenever `op` became 0, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least one element, `t` is a list containing the element `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains unchanged, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is 0 if the if condition is met, otherwise `op` retains its original value, `ai` is 0 if the if condition is met, otherwise `ai` retains its original value, `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least two elements, `t` is a list containing the element `ai` if `op` is 0 (otherwise `t` remains unchanged), `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0 (otherwise `ai` is unchanged), `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `val` is the next element in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least two elements, `t` is a list containing the elements it originally had plus `ai` if `op` was 0, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`, `ai` is `val` if `op` was 0, otherwise `ai` remains unchanged, `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `val` is the next element in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
