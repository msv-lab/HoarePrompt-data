To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, let's break down the operation:

Given:
- `op` is initially 1.
- `val` is `a[1]`.
- `i` is a non-negative integer.

The line of code is:
```python
op ^= val >> i & 1
```

This line performs a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the result of `val >> i & 1`.

Let's analyze the expression `val >> i & 1`:
- `val >> i` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions.
- `& 1` extracts the least significant bit (LSB) of the result from the shift operation.

So, `val >> i & 1` gives us the `i`th bit of `val`. Let's denote this value as `bit_i`.

Now, `op ^= bit_i` means `op` is updated to `op XOR bit_i`.

Since `op` is initially 1, the new value of `op` will be:
- If `bit_i` is 0, `op` remains 1 (since 1 XOR 0 = 1).
- If `bit_i` is 1, `op` becomes 0 (since 1 XOR 1 = 0).

Thus, the new value of `op` depends on the `i`th bit of `val`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the return value of `func_1()` and contains at least two elements, `t` is either an empty list or a list containing the updated `ai` (which is now `ai ^ val`), `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and equals 0, `v` is an even number or 0, `op` is `1 ^ (a[1] >> i & 1)`**
This means `op` is 1 if the `i`th bit of `a[1]` is 0, and `op` is 0 if the `i`th bit of `a[1]` is 1.
