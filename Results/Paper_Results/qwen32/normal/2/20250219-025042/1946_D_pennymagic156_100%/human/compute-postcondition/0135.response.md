The code snippet appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Since `ai` is `val` when `op` was 0, and `val` is the next element in `a`, the list `t` will now include this new element.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `t`, which now contains an additional element `ai`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list containing at least two elements, `t` is a list containing the elements it originally had plus `ai`, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `cnt` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `val` is the next element in `a`**.
