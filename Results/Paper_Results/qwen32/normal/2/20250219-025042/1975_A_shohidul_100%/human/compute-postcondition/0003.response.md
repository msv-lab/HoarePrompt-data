The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns these integers to the list `a`. This means that the list `a` will now contain `n` integers provided by the user.

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The variable `n` also remains unchanged because it was already defined before the code snippet and is used to determine the number of integers to read from the input. The list `a` is updated to contain the integers from the user input.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the integer provided by user input; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.**
