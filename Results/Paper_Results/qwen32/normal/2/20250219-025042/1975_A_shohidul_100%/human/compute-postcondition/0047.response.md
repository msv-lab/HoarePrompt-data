Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. This variable seems to represent the number of test cases or iterations but is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
2. **`n`**: An integer provided by user input. This represents the number of elements in the list `a`.
3. **`a`**: A list of `n` integers provided by user input, where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6.
4. **`check_all`**: A boolean variable that is set to `True` if the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it is set to `False`. However, this variable is not used in the provided code snippet.
5. **`_`**: Incremented by 1. This could be a counter, but it is also not used in the provided code snippet.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains only a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`.
- None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `_`) are referenced in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the output will always be the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of the variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
