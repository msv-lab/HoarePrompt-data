The code snippet `new = a[i:]` creates a new list `new` that contains all elements of the list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list. 

Given the initial state, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` now holds the value `i + 1`. The variable `new` is assigned the sublist of `a` starting from index `i`.

Since the exact values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` are not specified beyond their constraints, we can only describe the transformation in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `_` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of the list.**
