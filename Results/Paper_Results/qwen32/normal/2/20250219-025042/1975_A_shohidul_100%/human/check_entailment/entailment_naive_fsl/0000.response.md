Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining whether the array can be split and rearranged to become non-decreasing is flawed.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Splits**: The current implementation only checks for a single split point and determines the result based on that. However, the problem allows for multiple splits, and the array may need more than one split to become non-decreasing.

2. **Incorrect Conditions for Valid Split**: The conditions used to check if a split results in a non-decreasing array are not comprehensive. For example, the condition `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the new part, but it does not ensure that the entire array becomes non-decreasing after the split.

3. **Incorrect Output for Some Cases**: The program incorrectly outputs "NO" for some cases where the array can indeed be rearranged to become non-decreasing with appropriate splits.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5
2 3 1 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Yes
```

**Explanation:**
- The array `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]` can be split into `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4, 5]`, and then swapped to form `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`.
- This intermediate array can be further split into `x = [1, 4, 5]` and `y = [2, 3]`, and then swapped to form `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`.
- Finally, this array can be split into `x = [2, 3]` and `y = [1, 4, 5]`, and then swapped to form `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`.
- After another split into `x = [1]` and `y = [4, 5, 2, 3]`, and then swapped to form `[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]`.
- And finally, split into `x = [4, 5]` and `y = [2, 3, 1]`, and then swapped to form `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]`.
- This process can continue until the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

However, the provided program would likely output "NO" for this test case because it only checks for a single split and does not account for multiple splits required to achieve a non-decreasing order.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to these issues.
