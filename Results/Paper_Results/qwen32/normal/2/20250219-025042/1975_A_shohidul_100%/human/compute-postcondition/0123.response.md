To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the input and modifies its state based on the conditions given.

### Loop Analysis
1. **Initialization**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
2. **Loop Body**:
   - For each iteration, the loop reads an integer `n` (between 2 and 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers.
   - It checks if the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order using the variable `check_all`.
   - If `check_all` is `True`, it prints "YES".
   - If `check_all` is `False`, it iterates through the list to find the first pair of elements where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. It then checks two conditions:
     - All elements from the start of the list up to the point of the first decrease should be greater than or equal to all elements from the point of the first decrease onwards (`check_all_new`).
     - The sublist starting from the point of the first decrease should be sorted in non-decreasing order (`new_all`).
     - If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.

### Final Output State
After all `t` iterations, the loop will have processed `t` different lists `a` and printed "YES" or "NO" for each list based on the conditions described above. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will reflect the values from the last iteration of the loop.

### Output State Format
Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations completed (initial value minus remaining iterations); `n` is the integer from the last iteration; `a` is the list of integers from the last iteration; the loop has printed "YES" or "NO" for each of the `t` iterations.**

### Natural Language Explanation
The final output state after the loop completes all its iterations is that the loop has processed all `t` input lists `a` and printed either "YES" or "NO" for each list based on whether the list is sorted or can be split into two parts where the first part is greater than or equal to the second part and the second part is sorted. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations completed; `n` is the integer from the last iteration; `a` is the list of integers from the last iteration; the loop has printed "YES" or "NO" for each of the `t` iterations.**
