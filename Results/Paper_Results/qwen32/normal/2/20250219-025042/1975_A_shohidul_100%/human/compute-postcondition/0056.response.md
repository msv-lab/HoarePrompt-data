Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6; `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`; `check_all` is `False` if `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order after the check; `_` is incremented by 1; `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`; `check_all_new` is `True`; `new_all` is `False`. Additionally, either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both).**
