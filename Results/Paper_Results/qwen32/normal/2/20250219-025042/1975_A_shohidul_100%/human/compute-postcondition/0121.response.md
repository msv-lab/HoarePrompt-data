To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000 (remains unchanged throughout the loop).
   - `n`: Number of elements in the list `a` (remains unchanged).
   - `a`: A list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6 (remains unchanged).
   - `check_all`: Boolean indicating if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the point where `a[i-1] > a[i]`.
   - `_`: Incremented by 1 each iteration (not relevant to the final output state).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `a[i-1] > a[i]`.
   - If `a[i-1] > a[i]`, it creates a new list `new` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new`: Whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`.
     - `new_all`: Whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' and breaks the loop.
   - If either condition is not met, it prints 'NO' and breaks the loop.
   - If `a[i-1] <= a[i]`, it continues to the next iteration without modifying `check_all`.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will terminate either when it finds an `i` such that `a[i-1] > a[i]` and checks the conditions on `new`, or when it completes all iterations without finding such an `i`.
- If the loop completes all iterations without finding any `i` such that `a[i-1] > a[i]`, it means the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- In this case, `check_all` will remain `True` throughout the loop, and the loop will not print 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
- After all iterations, the final state will depend on whether the list `a` was sorted or not.
- If `a` was sorted, `check_all` will be `True`, and no 'YES' or 'NO' will be printed.
- If `a` was not sorted, the loop would have already terminated with a 'YES' or 'NO' print statement during one of the iterations.

Since the problem specifies the output states after the first three iterations, and the loop terminates as soon as it finds an `i` such that `a[i-1] > a[i]`, the final output state will reflect the result of these checks.

### Final Output State:
If the loop completes all iterations without finding any `i` such that `a[i-1] > a[i]`, the final state is:
Output State: **check_all is True, no 'YES' or 'NO' printed.**

If the loop finds such an `i` and checks the conditions on `new`, the final state is:
Output State: **either 'YES' or 'NO' printed based on the conditions on `new`.**

However, since the question asks for the state after all iterations, and assuming the list `a` is not sorted and the loop terminates early, the most likely scenario is that the loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' and breaks. Given the nature of the loop, the final state will be determined by the first occurrence of `a[i-1] > a[i]`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **either 'YES' or 'NO' printed based on the conditions on `new`.**

For simplicity and given the problem constraints, we can assume the loop terminates early with a 'YES' or 'NO'. Therefore, the final output state can be generalized as:

Output State: **either 'YES' or 'NO' printed based on the conditions on `new`.**

However, if we need a specific final state without additional information, we can consider the case where the list is sorted, leading to:

Output State: **check_all is True, no 'YES' or 'NO' printed.**

But since the loop typically terminates early with a 'YES' or 'NO', the most accurate general answer is:

Output State: **either 'YES' or 'NO' printed based on the conditions on `new`.**

For the sake of providing a concrete answer, we can assume the loop terminates early with a 'YES' or 'NO':

Output State: **'YES' or 'NO' printed based on the conditions on `new`.**

Given the typical behavior, let's assume the loop terminates early with a 'NO':

Output State: **NO**

This is a reasonable assumption based on the loop's behavior and the problem constraints. Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **NO**
