Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `check_all` is `False` because `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 4, `new` is a list containing elements from `a[4:]`, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True` or `False`.**
