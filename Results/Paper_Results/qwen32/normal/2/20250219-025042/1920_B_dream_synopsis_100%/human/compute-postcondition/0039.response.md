To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to this point:

1. **Variables and Initial State**:
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive).
   - `n`, `k`, and `x`: Integers read from the input.
   - `a`: A reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.
   - `sum1`: The sum of all elements in the list `a`.
   - `ans`: A list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the value of `sums` computed after each iteration of the loop.

2. **Understanding `ans`**:
   - `ans` is populated within a loop that runs `k + 1` times.
   - In each iteration, a certain value `sums` is computed and added to the `ans` list.
   - The exact computation of `sums` is not specified in the initial state, but it is derived from the elements of `a` and possibly other variables (`n`, `k`, `x`).

3. **Determining `max(ans)`**:
   - Since `ans` contains `k + 1` elements, `max(ans)` will be the maximum value among these elements.
   - Without knowing the specific computation of `sums` in each iteration, we can only say that `max(ans)` is the largest value that gets computed and stored in `ans`.

Given the above information, the precise value of `max(ans)` cannot be determined without additional details about how `sums` is computed in each iteration of the loop. However, we can describe the output in terms of the `ans` list.

Output: **max(ans) (where max(ans) is the maximum value in the list ans, which contains k + 1 elements computed during the loop iterations)**
