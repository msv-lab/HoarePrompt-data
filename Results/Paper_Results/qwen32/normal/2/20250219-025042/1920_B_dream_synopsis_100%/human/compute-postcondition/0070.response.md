The code snippet assigns the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` to the variable `sums`. Given that `i` is initially 0, this assignment affects the second element of the list `ans` as well, making it equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; `i` is 0.**
