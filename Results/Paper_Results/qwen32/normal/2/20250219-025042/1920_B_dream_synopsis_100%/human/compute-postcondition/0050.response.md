The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input where `k` must be at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing one element, which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; The current value of `i` is 0; `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
