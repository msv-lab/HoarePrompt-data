To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which is just `i` in this case. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `k` inclusive.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n`, `x` are integers read from the input
- `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`
- `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`
- `sums` is calculated based on the value of `i`

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had some value, let's call it `i_prev`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted. Therefore, the only change needed is to increment `i` by 1.

Let's assume `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the last iteration. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `x` are integers read from the input, `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`** 

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it to say that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
