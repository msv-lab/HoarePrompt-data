The given code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified in the provided code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n`, `x` are integers read from the input
- `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`
- `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`

After executing `ans.append(sums)`, the list `ans` now contains one more element, which is the current value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `x` are integers read from the input, `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the previous value of `sums` and the current value of `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
