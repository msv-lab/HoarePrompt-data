The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is at least 0; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, the second being the value of `sums`; `i` is `k + 1`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[k] - 2 * a[k + x]`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `t` remains unchanged, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `sum1` remains unchanged, `ans` now has two elements with the second element being the value of `sums`, `i` remains `k + 1`, and `sums` is updated as described.
