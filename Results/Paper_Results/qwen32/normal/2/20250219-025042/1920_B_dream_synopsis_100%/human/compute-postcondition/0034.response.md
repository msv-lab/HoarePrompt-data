The code snippet adds the element at index `i-1` of the list `a` to the variable `sums`. Given that `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, and `i` is incremented by 1 before this operation, `sums` will now include the next element from the list `a`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this operation, the element at index `i-1` corresponds to the current value of `i` before the increment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` (both at least 0), and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `ans` is a list containing two elements; `i` is `i + 1`; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
