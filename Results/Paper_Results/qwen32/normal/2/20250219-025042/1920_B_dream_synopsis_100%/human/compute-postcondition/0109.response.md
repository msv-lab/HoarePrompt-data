To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which is just `i` in this case. The loop iterates over the range `k + 1`, so `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n`, `x` are integers read from the input
- `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`
- `ans` is a list containing the previous value(s) of `sums` and the current value of `sums`
- `i` is `i + 1`

We need to adjust `i` for the next iteration. Since `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be its previous value plus one.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
2. To start the next iteration, `i` should be set to its value at the beginning of the previous iteration plus one.

Therefore, if `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means `i` was `i` at the start of the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `x` are integers read from the input, `k` is an integer read from the input and is at least 0, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the previous value(s) of `sums` and the current value of `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`**
