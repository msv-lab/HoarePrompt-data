Let's analyze the provided program to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a game on an \( n \times n \) chessboard where players place rooks under specific rules. The goal is to determine the number of distinct final configurations of the board after a series of moves.

### Key Points:
1. **Initial Moves**: \( k \) moves have already been made.
2. **Move Rules**:
   - Player places a white rook at \((r, c)\).
   - Computer places a black rook at \((c, r)\) unless \( r = c \).
3. **Objective**: Calculate the number of distinct final configurations after all possible moves are made.
4. **Constraints**:
   - \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \) (number of test cases).
   - \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5 \) (size of the board).
   - \( 0 \leq k \leq n \) (number of initial moves).

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case:
- Reads \( n \) and \( k \).
- Processes \( k \) moves to determine how many positions are blocked.
- Calculates the number of free positions \( m = n - \text{num} \).
- Uses dynamic programming to compute the number of distinct configurations for the remaining positions.

### Issues Identified

1. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` seems incorrect.
   - The problem of placing rooks without attacking each other is more complex than this simple DP formula suggests.
   
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 0 \), the board is trivially filled with one rook, and the number of configurations should be 1.
   - When \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 0 \), the number of configurations should be 3 (one rook in each of the four positions, plus the empty board).
   - When \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 0 \), the number of configurations should be 13 (more complex calculation).

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - The program does not account for the fact that the placement of rooks affects future placements in a more intricate manner than just counting blocked positions.
   - The DP approach used is not appropriate for this combinatorial problem.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle the problem's constraints and requirements. Specifically, the dynamic programming transition formula is incorrect, and the program fails to account for the complexities involved in placing rooks without attacking each other.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The program incorrectly uses a simple dynamic programming approach to solve a problem that requires a more sophisticated combinatorial solution. The transition formula used in the DP table does not accurately represent the problem's constraints, leading to incorrect results for various inputs.
