To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1
- `m` is `n`
- `c` is the first integer from the new input
- `r` is the second integer from the new input
- `i` is `i + 1`
- If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2; otherwise, `num` is 3.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we know that the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `r`, and `num`) are not part of the loop head, they should remain unchanged.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, it should be `i + 2`.
- `k` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is `n`, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `i + 2`. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2; otherwise, `num` is 3.**
