Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input. If `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2; otherwise, `num` is 3. `i` is incremented by 1 if `c` does not equal `r`.**
