The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` retain their original values. Specifically, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 0, and `m` is equal to `n`.

After executing the code, the new variables `c` and `r` are introduced and assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 0, `m` is `n`, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input.**
