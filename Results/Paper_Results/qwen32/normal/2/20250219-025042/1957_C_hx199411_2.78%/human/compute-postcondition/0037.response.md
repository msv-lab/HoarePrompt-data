The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `i` is less than `m + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 (since the loop starts from 3), and `m` is `n - num` where `m` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `m` remains the same as long as it is greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the equality of `c` and `r` over `k` iterations and `num` must be less than or equal to `n - 3`, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be greater than 2, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is 4**
