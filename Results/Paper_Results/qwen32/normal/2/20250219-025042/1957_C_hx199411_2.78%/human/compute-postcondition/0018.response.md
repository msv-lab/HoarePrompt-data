The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This means the previous values of `c` and `r` are overwritten by the new input values. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`**.
