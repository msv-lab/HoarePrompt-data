The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` was either 1 (if `c` equals `r`) or 2 (if `c` does not equal `r`). After the increment, `num` will be either 2 or 3 respectively.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged. Specifically, `i` is only incremented if `c` does not equal `r`, which is already accounted for in the initial state description.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `num` is 2 if `c` equals `r` otherwise `num` is 3, `i` is `i + 1` if `c` does not equal `r`.**
