The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given that `num` was initially set to 1 if `c` equals `r` and 2 otherwise, after the increment, `num` will be 3 if `c` equals `r` and 4 otherwise.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still `t - 1`
- `n` is still the first integer from the input
- `k` is still greater than or equal to 1
- `m` is still `n`
- `c` is still the first integer from the new input
- `r` is still the second integer from the new input
- `i` is still `i + 1`

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is `n`, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r` otherwise `num` is 4, `i` is `i + 1`**
