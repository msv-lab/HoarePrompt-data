The code snippet assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. This means that `l` now holds the same list as `l2`.

Given the initial state, `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`. Therefore, after the assignment, `l` will also have `a2` at position `idx1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, and `l` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`.**
