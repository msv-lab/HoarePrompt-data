The given code snippet only contains an `input()` function call, which reads a line from the input but does not assign it to any variable. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the same as at the end of the previous iteration; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input.**
