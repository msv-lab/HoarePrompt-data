The code snippet provided assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. This means that `l` now references the same list object that `l2` does. No other variables are modified by this assignment.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `l` is introduced and set to the value of `l2`.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1` and greater than `idx1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position `idx1`, `l` is `l2`**.
