Postcondition: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `val` includes at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
