Postcondition: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is not `-1`, `p1` is `0` or `1`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. Additionally, the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
