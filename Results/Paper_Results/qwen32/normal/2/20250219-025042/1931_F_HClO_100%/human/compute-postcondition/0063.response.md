The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Since `i` is initially set to 5, both `idx1` and `idx2` will now have the value 5. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `i` is 5; `idx1` is 5; `idx2` is 5. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
