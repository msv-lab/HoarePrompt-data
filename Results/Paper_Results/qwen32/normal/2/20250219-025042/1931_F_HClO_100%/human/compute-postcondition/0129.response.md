To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions. The loop iterates over each tuple `(a3, l3)` in the list `val`, which contains `m-2` tuples. For each iteration, it checks whether `l3` is equal to the list `l` with `a3` removed. If any `l3` does not match the corresponding modified list `l`, the loop breaks and prints 'no'. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it prints 'yes'.

Let's summarize the steps:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t`: integer input (>= 1)
   - `n`: integer input (>= 2)
   - `m`: integer input (>= 3)
   - `a1`: first integer from the input
   - `a2`: second integer from the input
   - `l11`: `l1` with `a2` removed
   - `l22`: `l2` with `a1` removed
   - `idx1`: determined based on `idx2`
   - `idx2`: not -1
   - `p1`: 1
   - `p2`: 1
   - `i`: `n - 3`
   - `val`: list of `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)`
   - `l`: modified list based on `idx1` and `idx2`

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - Iterates over each `(a3, l3)` in `val`
   - Checks if `l3` equals `l` with `a3` removed
   - If any `l3` does not match, prints 'no' and exits
   - If all `l3` match, prints 'yes'

After all iterations, the final state depends on whether the loop broke early or completed all iterations:

- **If the loop breaks**: This means there was at least one `l3` that did not match `l` with `a3` removed. The output will be 'no'.
- **If the loop completes all iterations**: This means all `l3` matched `l` with `a3` removed. The output will be 'yes'.

Since the problem states that the loop has executed the first 3 iterations without breaking, it implies that the first 3 `l3` matched their corresponding `l` with `a3` removed. Therefore, if the loop completes all `m-2` iterations without breaking, the final output will be 'yes'.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **the output state you calculate.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, if none of the `l3` lists differ from the list `l` with the corresponding `a3` removed, the output will be 'yes'. Given that the first 3 iterations did not break the loop, if the remaining iterations also do not break the loop, the final output will be 'yes'.
