The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. No other variables are affected, and the conditions regarding `n`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx2` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
