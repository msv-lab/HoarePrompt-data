Postcondition: **`idx1` and `idx2` will be set to the index where the first mismatch occurs with the specified conditions, or the loop will break when `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`. If `idx1` is `n - 2` and `idx2` is not `-1`, the loop has either found a mismatch at `idx2` or broken due to `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`. Otherwise, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain as per the conditions leading up to the if statement, and `val` remains an empty list. Additionally, `idx2` is `-1` and `idx1` is not `-1`.**
