Output State: **`val` contains at least one tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list. `m` is at least 3. The current value of `l3` is not equal to the list obtained by removing all occurrences of `a3` from another list `l`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `val`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, and `l` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
