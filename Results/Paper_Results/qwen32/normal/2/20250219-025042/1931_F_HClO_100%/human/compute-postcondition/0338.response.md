The code snippet `l = l2` assigns the reference of `l2` to `l`. This means `l` now points to the same list object that `l2` does. No changes occur to the elements or structure of `l2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, or `val`.

Output State: **`l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1`, increasing its length by 1; `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged relative to their positions in `l2` before the insertion; `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` remains unchanged; `val` remains an empty list; `l` is a reference to `l2`.**
