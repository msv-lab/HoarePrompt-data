In the given for loop, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the range function with `t` as its argument. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the execution of the loop, the only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

Given that `t` is already described as an integer input provided such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute since the condition is already satisfied by the problem statement.

However, if we were to explicitly state the condition for the loop to execute, we would say that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
