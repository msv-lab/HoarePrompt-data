Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `i` is `n-2`: This means `i` is set to the second last index of some list or array of size `n`.
- `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`: This indicates that `idx1` can take one of two specific values.
- `idx2` is not `-1`: This means `idx2` is set to some non-negative value.
- `p1` is `0` or `1`: This indicates that `p1` is a binary value.
- `p2` is `0` or `1`: This indicates that `p2` is a binary value.
- `val` is an empty list: This means `val` is initialized as an empty list.
- `m` is `2`: This means `m` is set to the integer value 2.
- `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`: This provides a relationship between `idx1` and `idx2`.
- Additional logic: If `idx2` was `-1` and `idx1` was not `-1`, then `idx2` is updated to `n-2`. However, since it's mentioned that `idx2` is not `-1`, this condition does not apply here, and no changes are made to `idx2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains only a `print` statement that outputs the string `'yes'`. The values of the variables (`i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `m`) do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it directly prints the string `'yes'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'yes'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **yes**
