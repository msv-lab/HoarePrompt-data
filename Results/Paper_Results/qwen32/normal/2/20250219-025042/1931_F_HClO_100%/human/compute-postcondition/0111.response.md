The code appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. This means that `val` now contains one additional element, which is the tuple consisting of `a3` and `l3`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx2` was initially -1 and `idx1` was not -1, otherwise `idx1` remains unchanged; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and the newly appended `(a3, l3)`; `l` is a list containing all the original elements of `l2` with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `l1` is not modified and `l2` is modified by inserting `a2` at position `idx1`. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `l1` is modified by inserting `a1` at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` is modified by inserting `a2` at position `idx1`; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.**
