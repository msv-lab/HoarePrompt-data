Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `idx2` is 1, `p2` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

Explanation: The value of `p2` is set to 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
