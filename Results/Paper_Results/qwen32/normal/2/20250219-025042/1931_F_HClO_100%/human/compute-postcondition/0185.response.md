Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is 1 and `p1` is 1. If `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx2` is 1 and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
