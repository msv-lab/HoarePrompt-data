The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('yes')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'yes'`. The initial state provides detailed information about various variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of the `print` statement is not influenced by any of these variables.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
