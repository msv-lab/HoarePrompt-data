The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(a3, l3)` and the list `val`. Therefore, we can only adjust these objects for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `val` contains at least one tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list.
- `m` is at least 3.
- If `l3` is not equal to the list obtained by removing all occurrences of `a3` from another list `l`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- The loop iterates over each tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`.
- After processing one tuple, the loop will move to the next tuple in `val`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be another tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val` to process.

State: **`val` contains at least two tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list, `m` is at least 3.**
