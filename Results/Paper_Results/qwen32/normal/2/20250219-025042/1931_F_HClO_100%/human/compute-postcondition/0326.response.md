Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 5, `m` are the integers read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, `p1` and `p2` remain 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is set to 4 and `p1` is set to 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, then `idx2` is set to 4 and `p2` is set to 1. `i` is 5. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both greater than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
