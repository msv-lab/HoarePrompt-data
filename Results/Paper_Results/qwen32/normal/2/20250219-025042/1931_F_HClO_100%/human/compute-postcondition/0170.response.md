Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1` and `idx1` is 0 with `p1` being 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, then `idx2` is 0 with `p2` being 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative integers, the program does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
