Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. If `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, indicating that there exists an index `i` such that `l1[i]` equals `a2` and `l2[i]` equals `a1`, then `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 and 1 respectively, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.**
