The code snippet creates a new list `l22` by filtering out elements from `l2` that are equal to `a1`. This means `l22` will contain only those elements from `l2` that are not equal to `a1`.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, and `l11` remain unchanged. The only change is the creation of `l22`.

Output State: **The loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes'. `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input. If `m` is equal to 1, the same state is maintained. Otherwise, the same state is also maintained since there is no else part to alter the state. `a1` is the first integer from the input, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. `a2` is the first integer from the new input, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`. `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`.**
