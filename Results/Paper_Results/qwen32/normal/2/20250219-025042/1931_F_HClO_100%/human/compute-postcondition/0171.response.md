Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]` unless `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1` in which case `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is 0 and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, then `idx2` is 0 and `p2` is 1. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative integers, the program does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
