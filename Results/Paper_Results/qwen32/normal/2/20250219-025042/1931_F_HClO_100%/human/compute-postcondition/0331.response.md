Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` and `p2` are integers, `val` is an empty list, and the loop has either found a mismatch at `idx2` or broken due to `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `idx1` has been updated to `n - 2`. All other variables (`idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`) and conditions remain unchanged.
