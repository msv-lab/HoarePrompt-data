Output State: **`n` must be at least 5, `m` are the integers read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop continues without consuming any additional lines of input. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, `idx1` and `idx2` retain their original values, and the loop or if statement does not break. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, `p1` and `p2` remain 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` retain their original values, and the loop or if statement does not break. `i` is 4. `idx1` is 4. `p1` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.`**

In simpler terms, the value of `p1` has been updated to 1, while all other variables retain their original values.
