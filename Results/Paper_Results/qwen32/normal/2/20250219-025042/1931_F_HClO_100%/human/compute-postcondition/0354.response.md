The code snippet `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. This means that `l` now holds the same list as `l2`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `idx1` is not `-1`, `idx2` is `-1` or `n - 2` depending on the condition; `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` remains unchanged; `val` remains an empty list; `a3` is the first integer from the input; `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the input; the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`; `l` is equal to `l2`.**
