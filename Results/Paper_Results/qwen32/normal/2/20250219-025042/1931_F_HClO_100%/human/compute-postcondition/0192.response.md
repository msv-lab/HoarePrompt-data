The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. No other variables are affected, and the condition related to breaking out of the loop or if statement remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `idx1` is 2. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
