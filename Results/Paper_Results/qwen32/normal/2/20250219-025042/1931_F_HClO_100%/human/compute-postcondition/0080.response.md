The code snippet assigns the value `n - 2` to `idx2`. Since `idx2` was initially `-1`, it is now updated to `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input provided such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 3 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the subsequent input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the subsequent input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `idx1` is `n - 2`; `idx2` is `n - 2`; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `val` is an empty list.**
