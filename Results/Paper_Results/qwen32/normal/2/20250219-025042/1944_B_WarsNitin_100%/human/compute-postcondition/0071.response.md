Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either -4 or retains its original value minus 2 if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, `ans2` contains `c[0]`, `c[1]`, and `c[2]` if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `req` equals the final value of `k`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not part of a consecutive duplicate sequence and are not the first or last element if they are repeated, `i` is 2. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
