The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to the list `ans1`. This means that `ans1` will now contain one more element, specifically `b[i]`.

Given the initial state, `ans1` could initially be one of three things:
1. An empty list.
2. A list containing the `n-1`th element of `b` twice.
3. A list containing the `n-1`th element of `b` twice followed by `b[i]` twice if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`.

After executing `ans1.append(b[i])`, `ans1` will have `b[i]` added to it. Therefore, the new state of `ans1` will be:
1. If `ans1` was initially empty, it will now be `[b[i]]`.
2. If `ans1` was initially `[b[n-1], b[n-1]]`, it will now be `[b[n-1], b[n-1], b[i]]`.
3. If `ans1` was initially `[b[n-1], b[n-1], b[i], b[i]]`, it will now be `[b[n-1], b[n-1], b[i], b[i], b[i]]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is either 0 or twice the second integer from the input minus 2 (decreased by 2 if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`), `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` contains the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` contains the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is a list containing the elements as described above, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` equals `k`, `q` is incremented by 1, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `l` contains the element `b[i]` appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
