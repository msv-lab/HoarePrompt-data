Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is either -1 or a negative even number minus 2, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal plus `l[i]`, `ans2` includes all pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` until `k` is exhausted plus `l[i]`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `l` must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change except for `i`, which is incremented by 1. We also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
