Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is either 0 or a negative even number, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `ans2` includes all pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` until `k` is exhausted, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is either -1 or a negative even number minus 2, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal plus `l[i]`, `ans2` includes all pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` until `k` is exhausted plus `l[i]`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `l` must have at least one element. If `k` is now 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `q`, and `l` remain the same. `k` is either -2 or a negative even number minus 4. `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal plus `l[i]` and now also includes `l[i]`. `ans2` includes all pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` until `k` is exhausted plus `l[i]`. `i` is `i + 1`. If `k` equals 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `ans2` now includes `l[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `q`, and `l` remain the same; `k` is either -3 or a negative even number minus 5; `ans1` includes the element `l[i]`; `ans2` includes the new element `l[i]` appended to its previous contents; `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
