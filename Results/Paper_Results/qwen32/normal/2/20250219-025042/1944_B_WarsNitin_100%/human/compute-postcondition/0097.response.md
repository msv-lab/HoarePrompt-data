The given code snippet appends `l[i]` to `ans2`. This means that `ans2` now includes `l[i]` as its last element. All other variables remain unchanged except for `ans2`.

Given the initial state, `k` is already decreased by 1, `ans1` includes `l[i]` as its last element, `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, and `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `req` depends on whether `k` was 0 before the decrement, but since `k` has been decremented, `req` will be updated accordingly if `k` reaches 0.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is decreased by 1, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` includes `l[i]` as its last element, `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, plus `l[i]` as its last element, `req` equals 0 if `k` was 0, otherwise `req` equals the final value of `k`, `l` must have at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1. If `k` was 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
