Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is either twice the second integer from the input or twice the second integer from the input minus 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` contains the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` contains the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the `n-1`th element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` equals `k`, `q` is incremented by 1. If `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the smallest element of the first `n` elements of `a` followed by the largest element if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, or `l` is a list containing only the largest element if `b[0]` is equal to `b[1]`. Otherwise, if `b[n - 2] == b[n - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the smallest element of the first `n` elements of `a` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, or `l` remains an empty list.**
