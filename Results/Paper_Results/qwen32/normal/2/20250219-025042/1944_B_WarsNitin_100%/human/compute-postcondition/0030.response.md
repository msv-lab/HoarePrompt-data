Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is `req - 2`; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` contains the last element of `b` three times followed by `b[i]`; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to the new value of `k`; `l` is an empty list if `b[0]` equals `b[1]` and `b[n - 2]` equals `b[n - 1]`, otherwise `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, and the last element of `b` (`b[n - 1]`) if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `k` has been decreased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
