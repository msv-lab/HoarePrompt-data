The code snippet `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans1`. This operation modifies `ans1` by adding a new element to it.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `req` remain unchanged except for `ans1`, which is updated.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true, otherwise `k` retains its original value, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` now includes `l[i]` as its last element, `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive duplicates from `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, `req` equals 0 if `k` was 0, otherwise `req` equals the final value of `k`, and `l` must have at least one element.**
