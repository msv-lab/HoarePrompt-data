Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or -2 if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains additional elements if there were consecutive duplicates in `b` within the range [1, n-2], `ans2` includes `c[i]` if `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not part of consecutive duplicates and are not the last element in their group, `i` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables except `i`, which is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
