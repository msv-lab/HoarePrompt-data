Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is either 0, -2, or `req - 2`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `ans2` includes two occurrences of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only terminates the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values, and the only change is the termination of the loop or if statement.
