The code snippet assigns the value of `req` to `k`. This means that after the execution of the code, the value of `k` will be the same as the value of `req`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `k`, which now holds the value of `req`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is the value of `req`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of consecutive elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes, `ans2` remains empty, `req` equals the final value of `k`, `l` contains unique elements from `b` that are not part of a consecutive duplicate sequence and are not the first or last element if they are repeated.**
