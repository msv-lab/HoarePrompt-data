The code snippet sets `ans1` to an empty list. This means the previous contents of `ans1` are discarded, and it now holds no elements.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` contains the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` contains the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` contains the first `min(k, len(l))` elements of `l`, `req` equals `max(0, k - len(l))`, `l` remains the same, `q` is incremented by 1.**
