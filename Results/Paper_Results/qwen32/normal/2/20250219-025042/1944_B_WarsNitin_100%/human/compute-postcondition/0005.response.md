The code snippet `c = a[n:]` assigns to `c` the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list `a`. This means that `c` will contain all elements of `a` that come after the first `n` elements.

Given the initial state, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` contains the first `n` elements of `a`. After executing the code, `c` will contain the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end.**
