Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is greater than 4, `k` is either 0, -2, -4, or `req - 4`, `a` remains the same, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicates of elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, `ans2` includes two occurrences of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]` and additionally includes `c[3]` if `c[3]` equals `c[2]`, `req` remains the same, `q` remains the same, and `i` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
