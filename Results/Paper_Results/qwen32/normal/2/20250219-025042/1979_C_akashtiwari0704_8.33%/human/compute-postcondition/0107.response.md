Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of integers, followed by `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` where each `k_i` is between 2 and 20 inclusive. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
