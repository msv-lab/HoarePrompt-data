The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it calculates a modified list where each element is the product of all other elements divided by the current element. If the sum of the modified list is greater than or equal to the original product, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the modified list as a space-separated string.
