The code snippet `prod *= a[i]` multiplies the current value of `prod` by the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `prod` was initially set to 1, after executing this line, `prod` will be equal to `a[i]`.

Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000, `bets` is greater than or equal to 1, and `a` is a list of integers, these conditions remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `prod`, which now holds the value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `prod` is `a[i]`**.
