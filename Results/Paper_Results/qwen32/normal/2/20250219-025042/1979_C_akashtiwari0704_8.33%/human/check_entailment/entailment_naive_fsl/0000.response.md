Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The core issue lies in the logic used to determine the bets. The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then divides this product by each individual multiplier to determine the bets. This approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Let's analyze why this approach fails:

1. **Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`). For large values of `n` and `k_i`, this product can become extremely large, exceeding the constraint of `1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9`.

2. **Bet Calculation**: Each bet is calculated as `prod // a[i]`. This ensures that the sum of all bets is equal to `prod`, which is not necessarily less than `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

3. **Comparison**: The program checks if `sumo >= prod`. Since `sumo` is equal to `prod`, this condition will always be true, leading to the program incorrectly outputting `-1` for many valid cases.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
1
3
2 2 2
```

The program will calculate `prod` as `2 * 2 * 2 = 8`. The bets will be `8 // 2 = 4` for each outcome, resulting in a total bet of `4 + 4 + 4 = 12`, which is not less than `2 * 4 = 8` for any outcome. Therefore, the program will output `-1`, which is incorrect.

A correct approach would involve finding a set of bets that satisfy the condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`. One simple strategy is to set `x_i = 1` for all `i` and check if the condition holds. If not, incrementally adjust the bets to ensure the condition is met.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Try setting all bets to 1
        bets_list = [1] * bets
        total_bets = sum(bets_list)
        
        # Check if the condition is satisfied
        valid = True
        for i in range(bets):
            if total_bets >= a[i] * bets_list[i]:
                valid = False
                break
        
        if not valid:
            # If not, try setting each bet to a higher value
            bets_list = [a[i] - 1 for i in range(bets)]
            total_bets = sum(bets_list)
        
        # Output the bets
        ans = ' '.join(map(str, bets_list))
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected program sets each bet to `k_i - 1` to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
