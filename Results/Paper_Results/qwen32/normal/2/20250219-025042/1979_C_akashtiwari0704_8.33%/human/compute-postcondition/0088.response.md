The given code snippet modifies the value of `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it. The other variables (`prod`, `ans`, `T`, `bets`) remain unchanged based on the provided code.

Given:
- `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`.
- `sumo` is `sumo + int(a[i])`.
- `ans` is a string containing the string representation of each element in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` with spaces added based on the condition `sumo < prod`.
- `T` is incremented by `bets`.
- `bets` must be greater than 0.
- `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`.
- `i` is `bets`.

The code snippet:
```python
sumo += int(a[i])
```

This line adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Since `i` is `bets`, the value being added is `int(a[bets])`.

Output State: **`prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`; `sumo` is `sumo + int(a[bets])`; `ans` is a string containing the string representation of each element in `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]` with spaces added based on the condition `sumo < prod`; `T` is incremented by `bets`; `bets` must be greater than 0; `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`; `i` is `bets`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `sumo` is updated by adding `int(a[bets])` to it, while all other variables retain their previous values.
