The code snippet initializes a variable `prod` with the value 1. This does not affect the values of `t`, `bets`, or `a`. The only change is the introduction of the new variable `prod`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `bets` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `prod` is 1.**
