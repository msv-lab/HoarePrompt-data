The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t` and `bets` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `bets` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
