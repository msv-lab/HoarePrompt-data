You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        prod = 1
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        sumo = 0
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it calculates a modified list where each element is the product of all other elements divided by the current element. If the sum of the modified list is greater than or equal to the original product, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the modified list as a space-separated string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for each possible winning outcome. Formally, if `x_i` is the bet on the `i-th` outcome and `k_i` is the multiplier for that outcome, then the sum of all `x_i` should be less than `k_i * x_i` for every `i`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculating Product:**
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod = k_1 * k_2 * ... * k_n`.

3. **Calculating Bets:**
   - For each outcome `i`, it calculates the bet `x_i` as `prod // k_i`. This means that `x_i` is the product of all multipliers except `k_i`.
   - It also keeps a running total of these bets in `sumo`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - It checks if `sumo` (total bet) is less than `prod`. If `sumo` is not less than `prod`, it prints `-1` indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
   - If `sumo` is less than `prod`, it prints the calculated bets.

### Correctness Check:
- **Feasibility Condition:** The condition `sumo < prod` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each possible winning outcome because `prod // k_i` is the maximum possible bet for the `i-th` outcome such that `sumo < prod` holds true for all `i`.
- **Bet Calculation:** The bet `x_i = prod // k_i` ensures that the amount received for the `i-th` winning outcome is `k_i * x_i = prod`, which is indeed greater than `sumo` since `sumo < prod`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and checks if a valid distribution is possible. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
