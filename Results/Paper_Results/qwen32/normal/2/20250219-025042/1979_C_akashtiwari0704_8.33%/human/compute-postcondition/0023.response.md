Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `bets` is the number of iterations, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` before the modification, `prod` is `prod^(bets-1)`, `sumo` is the sum of all `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets-1`. The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
