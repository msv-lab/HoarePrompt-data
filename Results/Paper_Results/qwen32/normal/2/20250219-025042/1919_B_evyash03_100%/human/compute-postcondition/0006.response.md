Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters and must have at least 1 character, `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and 1 <= `length` <= 5000, `char` is the next character in `expression` to be processed, `count` is either 2 if `char` was '+', otherwise `count` is 1**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` was initially 1 if `char` was '+', it now becomes 2 if `char` was '+'. If `char` was '-', `count` was initially 0 and now becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
