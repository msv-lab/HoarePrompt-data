The code snippet initializes a variable `count` to 0. This does not affect the existing variables `expression` and `length`. Therefore, the output state remains with `expression` being a string of '+' and '-' characters, `length` being the length of that string, and `count` being initialized to 0.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters, `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and 1 <= `length` <= 5000, `count` is 0.**
