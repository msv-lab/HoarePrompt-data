### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problem and the program step-by-step to ensure our reasoning aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Recap:
1. **Conversion**: Convert the string `s` into an array `a` where each `'+'` is `1` and each `'-'` is `-1`.
2. **Splitting**: Split this array into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`.
3. **Penalty Calculation**: For each subarray `b_i`, calculate the penalty as `|sum(b_i)| * len(b_i)`.
4. **Optimization**: Find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
- **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the string and the string itself.
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **Counting '+'**: Counts the number of `'+'` characters in the string.
  - **Calculating '-'**: Calculates the number of `'-'` characters by subtracting the count of `'+'` from the length of the string.
  - **Returning Penalty**: Returns the absolute difference between the count of `'+'` and `'-'`.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Approach**: The function `func_1` does not attempt to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of `'+'` and `'-'` characters in the entire string.
- **No Optimization**: The program does not explore any splitting strategies to minimize the total penalty, which is essential for solving the problem correctly.

#### Verification Against Function Summary:
The function summary correctly describes what `func_1` doesâ€”calculate and return the absolute difference between the length of the input string and twice the number of `'+'` characters. However, this calculation does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the penalty through optimal splitting.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem correctly. It fails to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
