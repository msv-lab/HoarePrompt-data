The code snippet increments the variable `count` by 1. Given the initial state, `count` is initially set to 2 if `char` is '+', otherwise it is set to 1. After executing `count += 1`, if `count` was initially 2, it becomes 3, and if `count` was initially 1, it becomes 2.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters and must have at least 1 character, `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and 1 <= `length` <= 5000, `char` is the next character in `expression` to be processed, `count` is 3 if `char` was '+', otherwise `count` is 2.**
