To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over each character `char` in the string `expression`.

Given:
- `expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters and must have at least 1 character.
- `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and 1 <= `length` <= 5000.
- If the current character `char` is '+', then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `expression` is a string of length `length`.
- `char` is the character that was just processed.
- `count` is either 1 (if `char` was '+') or 0 (if `char` was '-').

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be updated to the next character in the string `expression`. The variable `length` does not change as it is the total number of characters in the string. The variable `count` is recalculated based on the new value of `char`.

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `char` was the `k-th` character in `expression`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `char` should be the `(k+1)-th` character in `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters and must have at least 1 character, `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and 1 <= `length` <= 5000, `char` is the next character in `expression` after the previously processed character, `count` is 1 if `char` is '+', otherwise `count` is 0**.

Since we don't know the exact position of `char` in `expression` from the given information, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters and must have at least 1 character, `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and 1 <= `length` <= 5000, `char` is the next character in `expression` to be processed, `count` is 1 if `char` is '+', otherwise `count` is 0**.
