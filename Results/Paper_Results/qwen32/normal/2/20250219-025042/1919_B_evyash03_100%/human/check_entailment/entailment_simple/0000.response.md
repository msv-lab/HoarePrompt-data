### Reasoning:
The given program calculates the minimum possible penalty by returning the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`. This approach does not correctly solve the problem as described.

The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays such that the total penalty, which is the sum of penalties of individual subarrays, is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. The optimal solution involves dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the best way to split the array, which is not what the current program does.

The current program simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which does not account for the optimal splitting of the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.
