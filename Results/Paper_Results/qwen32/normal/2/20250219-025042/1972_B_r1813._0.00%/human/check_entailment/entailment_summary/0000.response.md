### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. According to the problem statement, Alice wins if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and Bob wins if the number of facing-up coins is even. This is because the game's rules imply that the player who faces an odd number of facing-up coins at the start of their turn can always force a win with optimal play.

The provided program reads multiple test cases, counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string representation of the coins for each test case, and checks if this count is odd or even. Based on this check, it appends 'YES' to the results list if the count is odd and 'NO' if the count is even. Finally, it prints out the results for all test cases.

The logic implemented in the program aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
