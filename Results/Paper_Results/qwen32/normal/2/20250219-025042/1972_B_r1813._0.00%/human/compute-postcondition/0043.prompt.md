Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by whitespace, where the first element is the number of test cases `t` (which must be greater than 0), followed by pairs of strings for each test case (the first being the number of coins `n` and the second being the string `s`). `index` is `2 * t + 1`; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` (and `t` must be 0). `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `num_up_coins` is odd, or the string `'NO'` if `num_up_coins` is even, and now includes an additional `'YES'` if `num_up_coins` is odd, or an additional `'NO'` if `num_up_coins` is even for each test case.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by whitespace, where the first element is the number of test cases `t` (which must be greater than 0), followed by pairs of strings for each test case (the first being the number of coins `n` and the second being the string `s`), `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` (and `t` must be 0), `results` is a list containing at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by whitespace, where the first element is the number of test cases `t` (which must be greater than 0), followed by pairs of strings for each test case (the first being the number of coins `n` and the second being the string `s`), `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` (and `t` must be 0), `results` is a list containing at least two elements

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by whitespace, where the first element is the number of test cases `t` (which must be greater than 0), followed by pairs of strings for each test case (the first being the number of coins `n` and the second being the string `s`), `index` is 1, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least two elements, and `result` is the next element in `results`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
