### Reasoning:

The provided program reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it counts the number of coins that are facing up ('U'). The key observation in the problem is that Alice wins if and only if the number of facing-up coins is odd. This is because flipping an even number of facing-up coins will always leave an even number of facing-up coins, and vice versa. Since the game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, the player who starts with an odd number of facing-up coins can always force a win by maintaining an odd count of facing-up coins after their turn.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if the count of 'U' in the string `s` is odd (`num_up_coins % 2 == 1`). If it is, Alice wins, and the program appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
