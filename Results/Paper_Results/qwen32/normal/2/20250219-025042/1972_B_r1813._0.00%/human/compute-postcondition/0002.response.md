Output State: **`data` is a list of strings representing the input split by whitespace, where the first element is the number of test cases `t`, followed by pairs of strings for each test case (the first being the number of coins `n` and the second being the string `s`). `index` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `index` is initialized to 0, but the contents of `data` remain unchanged as it is only used to store the input data and is not modified by the given code snippet.
