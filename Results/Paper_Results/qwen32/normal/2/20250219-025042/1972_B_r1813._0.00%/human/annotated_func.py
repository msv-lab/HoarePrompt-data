#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting only of characters "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings representing the input split by whitespace, where the first element is the number of test cases `t` (which must be greater than 0), followed by pairs of strings for each test case (the first being the number of coins `n` and the second being the string `s`). `index` is `2 * t + 1`; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` (and `t` must be 0). `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `num_up_coins` is odd, or the string `'NO'` if `num_up_coins` is even, and now includes an additional `'YES'` if `num_up_coins` is odd, or an additional `'NO'` if `num_up_coins` is even for each test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: All elements in `results` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of coins and their states (up or down). For each test case, it determines if the number of coins facing up is odd and outputs 'YES' if it is, otherwise 'NO'.
