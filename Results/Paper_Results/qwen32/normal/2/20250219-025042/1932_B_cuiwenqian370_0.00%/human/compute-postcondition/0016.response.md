Output State: **`path` is the string value of the fifth element in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `index` is 5; `results` contains two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(path)` to the `results` list. Since `results` initially contained one element, which was also the result of `func_1(path)`, after the append operation, `results` now contains two identical elements. All other variables remain unchanged.
