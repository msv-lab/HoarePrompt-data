The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index]` to `path`. Given that `index` is 6, `path` will now hold the value of the seventh element in the `data` list (since list indices start at 0).

Therefore, the new value of `path` is the string value of the seventh element in `data`.

Output State: **`path` is the string value of the seventh element in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the sixth element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be greater than 0; `index` is 6; `results` contains two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(path)`**.
