Output State: **`path` is the string value of the fifth element in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `index` is 5; `results` contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(path)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
