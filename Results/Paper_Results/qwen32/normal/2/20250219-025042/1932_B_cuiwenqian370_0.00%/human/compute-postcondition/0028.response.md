The only variable in the loop head is `result`, which is being iterated over from the `results` list. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `result` and how it relates to the `results` list.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `result` is the element at position `t` in `results`.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the `results` list after the current `result` (element at position `t`). Therefore, `t` must be incremented by 1 to point to the next element in the list.

State: **`result` is the element at position `t + 1` in `results`**
