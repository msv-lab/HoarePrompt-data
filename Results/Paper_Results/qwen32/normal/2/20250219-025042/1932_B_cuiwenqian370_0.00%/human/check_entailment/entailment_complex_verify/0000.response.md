### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not match the problem description at all. Let's break down the reasons:

1. **Problem Description vs. Provided Code**:
   - **Problem Description**: The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the occurrence of each subsequent sign depends on the year the previous sign occurred.
   - **Provided Code**: The code involves a function (`func_1`) that processes a string of characters ('@' and '*') and calculates some kind of "score" based on these characters. This is entirely unrelated to the problem of determining the year of the n-th sign's occurrence based on periodicity.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle a path of characters ('@' and '*'). It calculates the maximum score by adding 1 for each '@' and setting the score to `-inf` for '*'. This logic is completely irrelevant to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign's occurrence.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input data and applies `func_1` to each test case. Since `func_1` is not relevant to the problem, applying it here does not solve the required problem.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, one needs to simulate the occurrence of each sign sequentially based on its periodicity. This involves iterating through the list of periodicities and calculating the next occurrence of each sign after the previous one has occurred.

Given the mismatch between the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
