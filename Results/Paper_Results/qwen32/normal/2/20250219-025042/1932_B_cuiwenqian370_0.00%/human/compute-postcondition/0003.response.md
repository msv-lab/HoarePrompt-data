The given code snippet simply assigns the integer value `1` to the variable `index`. This does not affect the values of `path`, `n`, `data`, or `t`.

Output State: **`path` is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers; `n` is an integer; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `index` is 1.**
