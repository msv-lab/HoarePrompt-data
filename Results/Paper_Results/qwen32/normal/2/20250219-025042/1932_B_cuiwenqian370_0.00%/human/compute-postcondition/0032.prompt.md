You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) represents the periodicity of a sign, and n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: `path` is the string value of the element at position `2 * t + 1` in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the element at position `2 * t` in `data`; `data` remains unchanged; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `index` is `2 * t + 1`; `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is the result of `func_1(path)` for each respective `path`.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: All elements in `results` have been printed. `data`, `t`, `path`, `n`, and `index` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `path`, which is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers where each integer \( a_i \) (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 10^6) represents the periodicity of a sign, and `n`, which is an integer (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100) representing the number of signs. The function returns a value based on the given periodicities and the number of signs. However, the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
