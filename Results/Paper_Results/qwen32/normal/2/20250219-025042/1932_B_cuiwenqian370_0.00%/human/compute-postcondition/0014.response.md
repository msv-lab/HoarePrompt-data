The code snippet assigns the value of `data[index]` to the variable `path`. Given that `index` is 4, `path` will now hold the value of the fifth element in the `data` list (since list indices start at 0).

Output State: **`path` is the string value of the fifth element in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the fourth element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `index` is 4; `results` contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(path)`**.

In simpler terms, `path` is updated to be the fifth element of the `data` list, while all other variables retain their previous values.
