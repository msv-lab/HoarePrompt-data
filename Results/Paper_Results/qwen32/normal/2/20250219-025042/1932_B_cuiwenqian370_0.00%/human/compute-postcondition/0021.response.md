Output State: **`path` is the string value of the seventh element in `data`; `n` is the integer value of the sixth element in `data`; `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be greater than 0; `index` is 7; `results` contains two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(path)`**

In simple terms, the only change is that the value of `index` has been incremented by 1, making it 7. All other variables remain unchanged.
