The code increments the value of `index` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `index` was initially 1, it is now 2.

Output State: **`path` is a string representing a sequence of space-separated integers, `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`, `data` is a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the original `path` string, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list**.
