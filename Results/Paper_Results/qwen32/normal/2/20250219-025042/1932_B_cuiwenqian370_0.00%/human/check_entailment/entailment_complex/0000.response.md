Reasoning:  
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem described. Let's break down why:

1. **Function `func_1` Misinterpretation**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum score in a path where '@' adds to the score and '*' invalidates positions. However, the problem requires finding the year when the nth sign occurs sequentially according to their periodicities, not calculating a score based on a path of '@' and '*'.

2. **Function `func_2` Misinterpretation**: The function `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases. However, it incorrectly passes the string representation of the periodicities directly to `func_1` instead of converting them into a list of integers and passing them appropriately. Additionally, `func_2` assumes that `func_1` solves the problem, which it does not.

3. **Algorithm Mismatch**: The problem requires simulating the occurrence of each sign sequentially based on their periodicities. This involves iterating through each sign, finding the next occurrence after the previous sign, and continuing until all signs have occurred. The provided code does not perform this simulation.

4. **Expected Solution**: A correct solution would involve iterating through each test case, initializing the current year to 0, and for each sign, finding the next occurrence year that is a multiple of the sign's periodicity and greater than the current year. Update the current year to this occurrence year and continue until all signs have been processed.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the required algorithm to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
