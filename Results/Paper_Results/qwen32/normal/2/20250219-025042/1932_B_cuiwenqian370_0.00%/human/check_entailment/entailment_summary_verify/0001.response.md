### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem description and the expected behavior.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine the year in which the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur.
- Each sign occurs at regular intervals (`a_i` years).
- Signs must occur sequentially, meaning the next sign can only occur after the previous one has occurred.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1(path)`**:
  - This function appears to be designed to process a string `path` containing characters '@' and '*', and calculates a score based on these characters.
  - It does not relate to the problem of finding the year of the nth sign.
  
- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1()` for each test case.
  - It passes a string `path` to `func_1()`, which is not what the problem requires. The problem requires processing a list of integers representing the periodicity of each sign.

#### Function Summary:
- The function summary for `func_2` indicates that it reads input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to compute a result for each test case. However, the summary does not align with the problem requirements since `func_1` does not perform the necessary calculations.

#### Correct Implementation:
- We need to implement a function that iterates through the list of periodicities and calculates the year when each subsequent sign can occur.
- Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(periods):
    current_year = 0
    for period in periods:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year
        current_year = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periods = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Evaluation:
- The provided code (`func_1` and `func_2`) does not solve the problem as described. It processes strings and scores, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.
- The original assessment is correct in stating that the provided code does not solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
