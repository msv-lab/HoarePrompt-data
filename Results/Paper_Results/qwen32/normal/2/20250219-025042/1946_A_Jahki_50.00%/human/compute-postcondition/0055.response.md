The given code snippet assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Since `new_median` was previously set to `b[ma]` before the increment, and the code reassigns it to `b[ma]` again without any further changes to `b[ma]`, `new_median` remains unchanged from its previous value.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `op` is 1; `i` is incremented by 1; `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1; `median` is `b[ma]` before the increment; `new_median` is `b[ma]` before the increment.**

In simpler terms, the output state remains the same as the initial state except that `new_median` retains its value from before the increment of `b[ma]`.
