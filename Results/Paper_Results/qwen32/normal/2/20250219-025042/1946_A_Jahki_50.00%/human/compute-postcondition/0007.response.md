The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the number `16668`. This number is explicitly provided in the code and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, and `op` are described in the initial state, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `16668`.

Therefore, the output will be the number `16668`.

Output: **16668**
