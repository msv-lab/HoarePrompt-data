The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, if `n` is greater than 10,000, it outputs `1` followed by `16668`. Otherwise, it calculates the median of the list, increments the median until it exceeds its original value, counts the number of increments, and outputs this count.
