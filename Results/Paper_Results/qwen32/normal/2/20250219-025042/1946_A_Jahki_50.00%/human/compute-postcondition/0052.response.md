The code snippet `b[ma] += 1` increments the element at index `ma` in the list `b` by 1. Since `median` and `new_median` are both initially set to `b[ma]`, incrementing `b[ma]` will also affect these variables.

Given that `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a`, and `median` and `new_median` are both initially equal to `b[ma]`, after the increment operation, `median` and `new_median` will no longer be equal to `b[ma]` unless `ma` is recalculated. However, since the problem does not specify any recalculation of `ma` or `median` and `new_median`, we assume they retain their previous values.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `b[ma]` is incremented by 1.
- `median` remains the same as its initial value (which was `b[ma]` before the increment).
- `new_median` remains the same as its initial value (which was `b[ma]` before the increment).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `op` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1; `median` is `b[ma]` before the increment; `new_median` is `b[ma]` before the increment.**
