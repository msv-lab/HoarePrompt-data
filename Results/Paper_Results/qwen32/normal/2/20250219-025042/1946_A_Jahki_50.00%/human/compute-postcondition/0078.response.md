The code snippet assigns the value of `int(num2 / 2) - 1` to the variable `ma`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `i`, and `op` remain unchanged. The variable `b` is still the sorted version of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `op` is 0; `b` is the sorted version of `a`; `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`.**
