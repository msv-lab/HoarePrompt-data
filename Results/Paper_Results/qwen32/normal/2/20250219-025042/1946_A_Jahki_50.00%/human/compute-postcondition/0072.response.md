The given code snippet initializes a new variable `op` to 0. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `i`). The only change is the introduction of the new variable `op`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `op` is 0**.
