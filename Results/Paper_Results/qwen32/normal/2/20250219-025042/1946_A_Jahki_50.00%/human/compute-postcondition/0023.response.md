The given code snippet updates the value of `new_median` to be equal to `b[ma]`. Since `new_median` was previously defined as `b[ma] + 1`, this assignment changes its value to match `b[ma]`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000; `case` is the input string; `op` is 1; `b` is the fully sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1 and placed in the correct sorted position; `median` is `b[ma]`; `new_median` is `b[ma]`.**
