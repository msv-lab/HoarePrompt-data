The code snippet updates the list `a` by parsing the input string `case` and converting each digit found into an integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num`, `num2`, `op`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000; `case` is the input string; `op` is 0.**
