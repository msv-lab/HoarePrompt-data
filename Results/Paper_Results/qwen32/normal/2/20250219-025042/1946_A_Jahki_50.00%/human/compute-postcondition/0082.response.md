Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `op` is 0; `b` is the sorted version of `a`; `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`; `median` is `b[ma]`; `new_median` is `median`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `new_median` is set to the value of `median`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
