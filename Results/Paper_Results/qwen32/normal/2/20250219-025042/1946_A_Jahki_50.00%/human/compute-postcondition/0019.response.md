To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `new_median <= median`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`
- `num` is greater than 0
- `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000
- `case` is the input string
- `op` is 0
- `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`
- `median` is `b[ma]`
- `new_median` is `median`

The loop condition `new_median <= median` suggests that for the loop to execute, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`. However, since `new_median` is initially set to `median`, the condition `new_median <= median` is already satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed to the values of `new_median` or `median` to ensure the loop executes. The state remains as is.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000; `case` is the input string; `op` is 0; `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `median` is `b[ma]`; `new_median` is `median`**
