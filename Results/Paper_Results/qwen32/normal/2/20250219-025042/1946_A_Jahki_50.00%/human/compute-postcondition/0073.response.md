Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `num` is greater than 0.
- `num2` is an input integer.
- `case` is the input string.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `op` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement directly outputs the integer `1`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `i`, `op`) are used in this print statement. Therefore, the output is simply the number `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
