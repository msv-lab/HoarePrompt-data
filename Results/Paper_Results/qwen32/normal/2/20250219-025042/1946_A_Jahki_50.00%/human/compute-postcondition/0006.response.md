The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides details about several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `op`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly specified as `1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(1)`.
2. The number `1` is a literal value and does not depend on any variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.
3. Since there are no operations or references to other variables in the `print` statement, the output will simply be the number `1`.

Output: **1**
