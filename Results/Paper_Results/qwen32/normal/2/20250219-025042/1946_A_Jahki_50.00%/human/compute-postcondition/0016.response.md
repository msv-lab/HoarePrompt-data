Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000; `case` is the input string; `op` is 0; `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`. If `num2` is even, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1`. If `num2` is odd, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**
