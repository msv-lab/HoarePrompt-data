Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000; `case` is the input string; `op` is 1; `b` is the fully sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1 and placed in the correct sorted position; `median` is `b[ma]` + 1; `new_median` is `b[ma]` + 1**

Explanation: The value of `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, which affects the sorted order of `b`. Consequently, both `median` and `new_median` are updated to reflect the new value of `b[ma]`, which is `b[ma] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
