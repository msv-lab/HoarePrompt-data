To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `new_median <= median`.
- In each iteration, the middle element (`b[ma]`) of the sorted list `b` is incremented by 1.
- After incrementing, the list `b` is re-sorted.
- The `op` counter is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The `new_median` is recalculated as the middle element of the newly sorted list.

### Observations from Given States:
- After 1 iteration: `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, and `op` becomes 1.
- After 2 iterations: `b[ma]` is incremented by another 1 (total 2 increments), and `op` becomes 2.
- After 3 iterations: `b[ma]` is incremented by another 1 (total 3 increments), and `op` becomes 3.

### Final State:
The loop will terminate when `new_median > median`. Since `median` is initially the middle element of the sorted list and `new_median` is recalculated after each increment, the loop will stop when the middle element of the list is no longer equal to or less than its previous value.

### Conclusion:
The loop will continue until `b[ma]` is incremented enough so that it becomes greater than the previous median. At this point, `new_median` will be greater than `median`, and the loop will terminate.

### Final Output State:
- `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, and `case` remain unchanged.
- `op` will be the total number of iterations the loop ran.
- `b` will be the fully sorted list with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median > median`.
- `median` will be the value of `b[ma]` before the last increment.
- `new_median` will be the value of `b[ma]` after the last increment, which is greater than `median`.

Since the exact number of iterations depends on the initial values and the input string `case`, we can't provide a specific numerical value for `op`, `b`, `median`, and `new_median` without knowing the input string `case`. However, we can describe the general state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000; `case` is the input string; `op` is the total number of iterations the loop ran; `b` is the fully sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case` with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median > median`; `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the last increment; `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]` after the last increment, which is greater than `median`.**
