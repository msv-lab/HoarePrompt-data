Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `num` is greater than 0.
- `num2` is an input integer.
- `case` is the input string.
- `op` is 0.
- If `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`.
- `b` is the fully sorted list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case` with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median > median`.
- `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before the last increment.
- `new_median` is the value of `b[ma]` after the last increment, which is greater than `median`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(16668)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the number `16668`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `b`, `median`, `new_median`, `i`) are used in this `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is the constant value `16668`.

Output: **16668**
