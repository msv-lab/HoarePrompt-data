To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `new_median <= median`.

Given the current state:
- `new_median` is initialized to `median`.
- `median` is derived from the sorted list `b` at index `ma`.

Since `new_median` is initially set to `median`, the condition `new_median <= median` will always be true unless we change either `new_median` or `median`.

To ensure the loop executes, we can adjust `new_median` to be less than `median`. However, since `median` is derived from the sorted list `b` and `new_median` is initialized to `median`, changing `median` directly might be complex without altering the list `b`.

Instead, we can simply adjust `new_median` to be less than `median`. Since `median` is an element from the sorted list `b`, we can choose any value less than `median` for `new_median`.

Let's assume `median` is some value `m`. To make sure `new_median <= median` holds true and the loop executes, we can set `new_median` to any value less than `m`.

For simplicity, let's assume `median` is `m` and set `new_median` to `m - 1` (assuming `m > 1`).

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`; `num` is greater than 0; `num2` is an input integer; `case` is the input string; `i` is `i + 1`; `op` is 0; `b` is the sorted version of `a`; `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`; `median` is `b[ma]`; `new_median` is `median - 1`**

This ensures that `new_median <= median` is true, allowing the loop to execute.
