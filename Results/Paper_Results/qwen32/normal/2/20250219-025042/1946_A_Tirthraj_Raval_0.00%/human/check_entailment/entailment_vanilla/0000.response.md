Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Median**: 
   - For an array of odd length `n`, the median is the middle element after sorting.
   - For an array of even length `n`, the median is defined as the element at index `ceil(n/2)`. However, in the problem statement, it seems to consider the lower middle element as the median, which is the element at index `(n+1)//2 - 1` after sorting.

2. **Objective**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of operations (each operation increases one element by 1) required to increase the median of the array.

3. **Approach**:
   - Sort the array.
   - Identify the current median.
   - To increase the median, we need to ensure that the median element becomes larger than its current value. This means increasing some elements such that the new median is greater than the old median.
   - The simplest way to do this is to increase the count of the current median element until it is no longer the median. Specifically, we need to increase enough elements so that the new median is the next largest unique element in the sorted array.

### Provided Program Analysis:

The provided program does the following:
- Reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
- It sorts the array.
- It calculates the index of the median using `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
- It counts the occurrences of the median element in the sorted array and prints this count.

### Issues with the Provided Program:

- **Incorrect Logic for Increasing the Median**:
  - Simply counting the occurrences of the median element does not tell us how many operations are needed to increase the median.
  - To increase the median, we need to ensure that the median element is no longer the median after the operations. This requires increasing enough elements so that the new median is the next largest unique element in the sorted array.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we should:
- Sort the array.
- Identify the current median.
- Determine the next largest unique element in the sorted array.
- Calculate the number of operations required to make the current median less than this next largest element.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
