The value of `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This calculation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`; only `p` is updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.**
