Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` = 0; no further iterations of the loop will occur; all test cases have been processed.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations based on the initial value of `t`, the loop terminates because `t` is decremented with each iteration until it reaches 0. At this point, there are no more test cases to process, and the loop ends. The state of `t` is specifically 0, indicating that all iterations have been completed.
