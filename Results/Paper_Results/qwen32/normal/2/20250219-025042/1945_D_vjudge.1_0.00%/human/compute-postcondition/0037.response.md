The code snippet provided modifies the value of `soma_b` by adding the element at index `i` of `lista_B` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `soma_b` is initially the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to the end of the list plus `lista_B[i]` plus `lista_B[n - k + 1]`. After executing the code snippet, `soma_b` will be updated to include `lista_B[i]` again, effectively making it `soma_b + lista_B[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input with at least `n - k + 1` elements, `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to the end of the list plus `lista_B[i]` plus `lista_B[n - k + 1]` plus `lista_B[i]`, `pref` is the accumulated sum based on the loop's conditions, `resultado` is `min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])`, `i` is `n - k + 2`.**
