To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to carefully analyze the logic and compare it against the requirements of the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis

Kirill is at the end of a queue of `n` people and wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. To do this, he can bribe people in front of him. Bribing a person at position `j` to swap places with Kirill costs `a_j` coins, and additionally, for every person between `j` and Kirill's current position, Kirill must pay `b_k` coins.

### Key Points

1. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost of bribes to get into one of the first `m` positions.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - Kirill starts at position `n+1`.
   - He can bribe people at positions `1` to `n`.
   - The cost of bribing someone at position `j` includes `a_j` plus the sum of `b_k` for all `k` such that `j < k < n+1`.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program to see if it correctly implements the solution:

#### Function `func_1()`

- **Input Parsing**: Reads `n` and `k` (where `k` should be `m` according to the problem statement), followed by two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
- **Reversal**: Reverses both `lista_A` and `lista_B`. This reversal seems unnecessary and potentially confusing.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - `soma_b` keeps track of the cumulative cost of bribing people between `j` and `i`.
  - `pref` accumulates the total cost for bribes up to a certain point.
  - The loop iterates through the first `n-k` elements, deciding whether to include the cost of bribing the current person or adding to the cumulative cost.
  - After the loop, it calculates the minimum cost for the last `k` positions.

#### Function `func_2()`

- **Test Cases Handling**: Reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Issues Identified

1. **Variable Naming**: The variable `k` in `func_1()` should be `m` according to the problem statement.
2. **Reversal**: Reversing the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect calculations.
3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost might not be correct due to the reversal and the way `pref` and `soma_b` are used.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, particularly the unnecessary reversal of lists and potential logic flaws, the program is likely incorrect.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
