Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input, `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to the end of the list, `pref` is the accumulated sum based on the loop's conditions, `resultado` is `float('inf')`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - k, n):
    resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
    soma_b += lista_B[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input with at least `n - k + 1` elements, `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to the end of the list plus `lista_B[i]`, `pref` is the accumulated sum based on the loop's conditions, `resultado` is `min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input with at least `n - k + 1` elements, `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to the end of the list plus `lista_B[i]` plus `lista_B[n - k + 1]`, `pref` is the accumulated sum based on the loop's conditions, `resultado` is `min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])`, `i` is `n - k + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input with at least `n - k + 1` elements, `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to the end of the list plus `lista_B[i]` plus `lista_B[n - k + 1]` plus `lista_B[i]`, `pref` is the accumulated sum based on the loop's conditions, `resultado` is `min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])`, `i` is `n - k + 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
