### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program to ensure it meets the problem requirements.

#### Understanding the Problem:
Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue with the minimum cost. He can swap positions with anyone in front of him, paying `a_i` to swap directly with the `i-th` person and `b_k` for every person he passes during the swap.

#### Program Explanation:
1. **Reversing Lists**: The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed. This is likely done to simplify the calculation of the cost from the end of the queue towards the beginning, which aligns with Kirill's goal of moving from the end to one of the first `m` positions.

2. **Initial Cost Calculation (`soma_b`)**: The variable `soma_b` accumulates the cost of passing people during swaps from the `n-k`-th position to the end of the queue. This is because Kirill can only consider positions up to `n-k` for direct swaps without exceeding his goal of being in the first `m` positions.

3. **Preference Cost (`pref`)**: The variable `pref` accumulates the cost of the optimal swaps up to the `n-k`-th position. It considers whether it's cheaper to swap directly with the `i-th` person (`lista_A[i]`) or to accumulate the passing costs (`soma_b`) and swap later.

4. **Final Result Calculation**: After calculating the initial preference cost, the program calculates the final result by considering the remaining positions from `n-k` to `n`. For each position, it updates the result with the minimum cost encountered.

5. **Multiple Test Cases**: The outer function `func_2` handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each one.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `4 2`, `7 3 6 9`, `4 3 8 5`
  - Reversed: `lista_A = [9, 6, 3, 7]`, `lista_B = [5, 8, 3, 4]`
  - Calculation:
    - `soma_b = 0`, `pref = 0`
    - Iteration 1 (`i=0`): `soma_b = 5`, `pref = 0`
    - Iteration 2 (`i=1`): `soma_b = 13`, `pref = 0`
    - Iteration 3 (`i=2`): `pref = 13` (since `lista_A[2] < lista_B[2]`)
    - Final Loop: 
      - `i=2`: `resultado = min(inf, 13 + 13 + 3) = 29`
      - `i=3`: `resultado = min(29, 13 + 13 + 4 + 7) = 29`
  - Output: `14` (Note: The detailed steps above show a discrepancy, indicating a potential issue in the explanation or code logic)

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `6 2`, `6 9 7 1 8 3`, `5 8 8 1 4 1`
  - Reversed: `lista_A = [3, 8, 1, 7, 9, 6]`, `lista_B = [1, 4, 1, 8, 8, 5]`
  - Calculation:
    - `soma_b = 0`, `pref = 0`
    - Iteration 1 (`i=0`): `soma_b = 1`, `pref = 0`
    - Iteration 2 (`i=1`): `soma_b = 5`, `pref = 0`
    - Iteration 3 (`i=2`): `pref = 5` (since `lista_A[2] < lista_B[2]`)
    - Iteration 4 (`i=3`): `soma_b = 13`, `pref = 5`
    - Iteration 5 (`i=4`): `pref = 18` (since `lista_A[4] < lista_B[4]`)
    - Final Loop: 
      - `i=4`: `resultado = min(inf, 18 + 13 + 9) = 40`
      - `i=5`: `resultado = min(40, 18 + 13 + 8 + 6) = 45`
  - Output: `22` (Again, there seems to be a discrepancy)

Given the discrepancies observed in the manual calculations compared to the expected outputs, it suggests that there might be an error in the logic or implementation of the program.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the discrepancies found between the expected and calculated results, the program does not seem to correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
