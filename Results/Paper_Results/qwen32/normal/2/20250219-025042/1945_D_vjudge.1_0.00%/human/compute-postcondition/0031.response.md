The code snippet provided increments `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. This means that `soma_b` now holds its previous value plus the element at index `i` of `lista_B`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `soma_b`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input with at least `n - k + 1` elements, `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to the end of the list plus `lista_B[i]`, `pref` is the accumulated sum based on the loop's conditions, `resultado` is `min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])`**
