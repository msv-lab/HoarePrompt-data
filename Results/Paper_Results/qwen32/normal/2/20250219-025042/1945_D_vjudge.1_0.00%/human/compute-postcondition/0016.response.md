The given code snippet increments the variable `pref` by the value of `soma_b`. No other variables are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be less than `n`, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `pref` is increased by `soma_b`.**
