### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its logic against the problem description to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
- Kirill starts at the end of a queue of `n` people.
- He wants to move to one of the first `m` positions.
- Bribing a person at position `j` costs `a_j` coins, and for every person between `j` and Kirill's current position, Kirill must pay `b_k` coins.

#### Code Analysis:

##### Function `func_1()`:
1. **Input Parsing**: It reads `n` and `k` (which should be `m`), and two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
2. **Reversal**: Both `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed. This step is problematic because reversing the lists changes the order of the costs, which is crucial for calculating the correct minimum cost.
3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - `soma_b` keeps track of the cumulative cost of bribing people between `j` and `i`.
   - `pref` accumulates the total cost for bribes up to a certain point.
   - The loop iterates through the first `n-k` elements, deciding whether to include the cost of bribing the current person or adding to the cumulative cost.
   - After the loop, it calculates the minimum cost for the last `k` positions.

##### Function `func_2()`:
- It reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Variable Naming**: The variable `k` in `func_1()` should be `m` according to the problem statement.
2. **Reversal**: Reversing the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` is incorrect because it disrupts the order of the costs, leading to incorrect calculations.
3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed due to the reversal and the way `pref` and `soma_b` are used.

#### Verification Against Function Summary:
The function summary for `func_2` is accurate in stating that it handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one. However, the summary does not address the issues within `func_1`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
Given the identified issues, particularly the incorrect reversal of the lists and the flawed logic for calculating the minimum cost, the program is indeed incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem due to the issues mentioned above.
