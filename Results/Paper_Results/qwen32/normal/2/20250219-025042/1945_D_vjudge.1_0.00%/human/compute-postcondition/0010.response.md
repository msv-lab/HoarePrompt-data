The value of `pref` is updated by adding the current element at index `i` in `lista_A` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be less than `n`, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input, `soma_b` is 0, `pref` is `pref` + `lista_A[i]`, and the current element at index `i` in `lista_A` is less than the current element at index `i` in `lista_B`.**
