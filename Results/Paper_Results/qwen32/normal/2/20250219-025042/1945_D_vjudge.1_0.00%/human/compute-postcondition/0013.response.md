The code snippet `soma_b += lista_B[i]` adds the value of `lista_B[i]` to the current value of `soma_b`. 

Given the initial state, `soma_b` was initially 0. After executing the code, `soma_b` will be equal to the value of `lista_B[i]`.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `pref`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be less than `n`, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input, `soma_b` is `lista_B[i]`, `pref` is 0, and `lista_A[i]` is greater than or equal to `lista_B[i]`.**
