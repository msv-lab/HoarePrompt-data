You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill, and k is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill such that 1 <= k <= n. lista_A is a list of n integers where each element represents the cost a_i for Kirill to swap positions with the i-th person. lista_B is a list of n integers where each element represents the cost b_i for Kirill to pass the i-th person during a swap. Both lista_A and lista_B contain positive integers.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `lista_A` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed version of the newly read list of integers from the input, `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to the end of the list, `pref` is the accumulated sum based on the loop's conditions.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: `resultado` is the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` encountered during the loop, `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1`, `i` is `n`.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: resultado (where resultado is the minimum value of pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] encountered during the loop, with i ranging from some starting point to n)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill), `k` (an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill such that 1 <= k <= n), `lista_A` (a list of n integers where each element represents the cost for Kirill to swap positions with the i-th person), and `lista_B` (a list of n integers where each element represents the cost for Kirill to pass the i-th person during a swap). The function returns the minimum total cost for Kirill to reach a position no greater than `k` in the queue.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
