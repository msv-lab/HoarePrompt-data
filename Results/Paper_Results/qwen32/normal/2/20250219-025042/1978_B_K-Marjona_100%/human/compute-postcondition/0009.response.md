The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means the initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

Since `t` was initially described as `t-1`, and there's no operation affecting `t` in the given code snippet, `t` remains `t-1`.

The variable `k` was initially defined based on the conditions involving `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since `n`, `a`, and `b` have now been reassigned, the value of `k` would also change according to the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, since the code does not recalculate `k`, its value remains as per the initial condition, which is now outdated.

Thus, the Output State only reflects the changes made to `n`, `a`, and `b` by the input operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `k` is the minimum value between the old `n` and `b - a` (or `n` and `0` if `b` was less than or equal to `a`), but `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated to the new input values.**
