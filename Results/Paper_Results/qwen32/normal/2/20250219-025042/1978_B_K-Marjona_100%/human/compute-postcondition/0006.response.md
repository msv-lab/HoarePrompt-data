To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the expression step by step based on the initial state provided:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not affect the print statement directly.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `k` is defined as the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.
- `b` is greater than `a`.

### Expression Breakdown:
The print statement is:
```python
print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

Let's analyze each part of the expression:

1. **`b * k`**: This term multiplies `b` by `k`.

2. **`k * (k - 1) // 2`**: This term calculates the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers. It is a well-known formula for the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is 1 and the last term is `k-1`.

3. **`(n - k) * a`**: This term multiplies the difference between `n` and `k` by `a`.

### Putting it Together:
The expression `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` can be understood as follows:
- `b * k` gives the product of `b` and `k`.
- `k * (k - 1) // 2` subtracts the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers from the previous result.
- `(n - k) * a` adds the product of the difference between `n` and `k` with `a`.

### Final Output Description:
Given the initial state and the breakdown, the output of the print statement will be the result of the above expression. Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` are not specified, we describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum value between n and b - a)**
