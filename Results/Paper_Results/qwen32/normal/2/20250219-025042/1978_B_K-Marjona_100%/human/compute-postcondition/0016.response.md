Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are new integers read from the input; `k` is the minimum value between the new `n` and the new `b - a` (or the new `n` and `0` if the new `b` is less than or equal to the new `a`).**

Natural Language: The value of `k` is updated to be the minimum of the new `n` and the difference between the new `b` and the new `a`. If the new `b` is less than or equal to the new `a`, `k` is set to the minimum of the new `n` and `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged except for `k` which has been recalculated.
