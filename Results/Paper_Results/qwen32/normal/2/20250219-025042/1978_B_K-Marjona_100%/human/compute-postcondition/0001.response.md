The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). After executing the code, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are determined by the input, and `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.**
