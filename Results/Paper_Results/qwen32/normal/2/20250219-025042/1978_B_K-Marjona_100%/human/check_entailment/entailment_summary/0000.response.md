### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The goal is to maximize the profit from selling `n` buns under the given conditions. The strategy involves choosing an optimal number `k` such that the first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price per bun), and `b` (price of the first bun in the promotion).

2. **Choosing `k`:**
   - The variable `k` is determined as `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and also does not exceed the difference between `b` and `a` (since selling more than `b-a` buns at a decreasing price would not make sense as the price would drop below the usual price `a`).

3. **Calculating Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means that the promotion price is not beneficial, so the maximum profit is simply selling all buns at the usual price `a`, which results in `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the program calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the promotional prices and the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`. The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
     - `b * k` calculates the total revenue from the first `k` buns sold at promotional prices.
     - `\frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2}` is the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers, representing the total discount applied due to the decreasing price.
     - `(n - k) * a` calculates the revenue from the remaining `n-k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

Let's verify the program against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(4, 5-4) = 1`
   - Profit: `5*1 - 1*(1-1)/2 + (4-1)*4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - Output: `17` (matches)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 9-5) = 4`
   - Profit: `9*4 - 4*(4-1)/2 + (5-4)*5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`
   - Output: `35` (matches)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10, 5-10) = 0`
   - Profit: `10*10 = 100`
   - Output: `100` (matches)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 11-5) = 5`
   - Profit: `11*5 - 5*(5-1)/2 + (5-5)*5 = 55 - 10 = 45`
   - Output: `45` (matches)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000-1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit: `1000000000*1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (matches)

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1-1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit: `1000000000*1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (matches)

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000, 1000-1) = 999`
   - Profit: `1000*999 - 999*(999-1)/2 + (1000-999)*1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500`
   - Output: `500500` (matches)

All test cases match the expected outputs, indicating that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit.
