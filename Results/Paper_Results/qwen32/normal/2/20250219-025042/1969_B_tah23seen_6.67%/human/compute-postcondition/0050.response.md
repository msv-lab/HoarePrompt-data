The code snippet `cost += right - left + 1` increases the value of `cost` by the expression `right - left + 1`. Given the initial state, `left` is 3 and `right` is `len(s) - 1`. Since `s[3]` is '1' and `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1', the value of `right` is the index of the last element in the list `s`.

Let's denote the length of `s` as `L`. Thus, `right` is `L - 1`. The expression `right - left + 1` evaluates to `(L - 1) - 3 + 1`, which simplifies to `L - 3`.

Therefore, the value of `cost` is increased by `L - 3`.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '0'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'; `left` is 3; `right` is `len(s) - 1`; `cost` is increased by `len(s) - 3`.**
