To determine the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided output states after the first three iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop swaps '1' at position `left` with '0' at position `right` when `s[right] == '0'` and `s[left] == '1'`, and increments the `cost` by `right - left + 1`.
- After each swap, `right` is incremented until it points to the next '0'.
- Similarly, `left` is incremented until it points to the next '1'.

### Observations from Given States:
1. **After 1st Iteration:**
   - `s` becomes ['0', '0', '1', '1', ...]
   - `left` is 2 (pointing to the next '1')
   - `right` is `len(s)` (since there are no more '0's to the right of `left`)

2. **After 2nd Iteration:**
   - `s` becomes ['0', '0', '0', '1', ..., '1']
   - `left` is 3 (pointing to the next '1')
   - `right` is `len(s)` (since there are no more '0's to the right of `left`)

3. **After 3rd Iteration:**
   - `s` remains ['0', '0', '0', '1', ..., '1'] (no changes since `right` is already at the end)
   - `left` is 3 (unchanged as there are no more '1's to the right of `left`)
   - `right` is `len(s)` (unchanged)

### Final State:
- The loop will continue to increment `left` and `right` until `left` is no longer less than `right` or either index reaches the end of the list.
- Since `right` is already at the end of the list after the third iteration and there are no more '0's to the right of `left`, the loop will terminate without further iterations.
- The final state of `s` will be a list where all '0's are moved to the beginning, followed by all '1's.

### Conclusion:
- The final `s` will be a list of all '0's followed by all '1's.
- `left` will be equal to the number of '0's in the list.
- `right` will be equal to the length of the list.
- The `cost` will reflect the total number of swaps performed during the loop.

### Output State:
Output State: **s is a list of all '0's followed by all '1's, left is the number of '0's, right is len(s), cost is the total number of swaps performed.**
