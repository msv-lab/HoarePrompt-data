The code snippet increments the value of `right` by 1. Given that `right` was initially set to `len(s) - 1`, after the increment, `right` will be equal to `len(s)`.

Here's the updated state:
- `sChar` remains unchanged as a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` remains unchanged as a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` with the first four elements being '0', '0', '0', and '1', and the last element being '1'.
- `left` remains unchanged at 3.
- `right` is now `len(s)`.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '0'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'; `left` is 3; `right` is `len(s)`.**
