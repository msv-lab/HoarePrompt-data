Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. The variable `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar`. The variable `left` is 0.**

Natural Language: The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `left` is now explicitly set to 0.
