To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop's header:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis of the Loop Condition:
1. **Condition 1**: `left < len(s)`
   - This condition ensures that the index `left` is within the bounds of the list `s`.

2. **Condition 2**: `s[left] != '1'`
   - This condition ensures that the character at index `left` in the list `s` is not '1'.

### Current State:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and has specific values at certain indices:
  - `s[0]` is '0'
  - `s[1]` is '0'
  - `s[2]` is '0'
  - `s[3]` is '1'
  - `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'
- `left` is 3
- `right` is `len(s)`

### Evaluation of Conditions with Current State:
- **Condition 1**: `left < len(s)` translates to `3 < len(s)`. Since `s[3]` is defined, `len(s)` must be at least 4, so this condition is satisfied.
- **Condition 2**: `s[left] != '1'` translates to `s[3] != '1'`. However, `s[3]` is '1', so this condition is not satisfied.

### Required Adjustments:
To make the loop execute at least once, we need to adjust either `left` or the value of `s[left]` such that both conditions are satisfied.

#### Option 1: Adjust `left`
If we decrease `left` to 2, then:
- `left < len(s)` becomes `2 < len(s)`, which is still true since `len(s)` is at least 4.
- `s[left] != '1'` becomes `s[2] != '1'`, and since `s[2]` is '0', this condition is now true.

Thus, the loop will execute because both conditions are satisfied when `left` is 2.

#### Option 2: Adjust `s[left]`
Alternatively, we could change the value of `s[3]` to '0'. However, since `s` is derived from `sChar` and the problem specifies the values of `s` at certain indices, changing `s[3]` directly might not be feasible without altering the definition of `sChar`.

Given the constraints and the need to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`left` and `s[left]`), the most straightforward adjustment is to change `left` to 2.

### Final State:
State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '0'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'; `left` is 2; `right` is `len(s)`**
