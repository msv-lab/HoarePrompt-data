The code snippet appends the variable `i` to the list `sChar`. Given that `i` is described as "the next element of `sChar`," it implies that `i` is a string consisting of only '0' and '1' characters, and its length satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5.

After executing the line `s.append(i)`, the list `sChar` now includes the new element `i` at the end. The precondition that `sChar` contains at least two strings remains valid because `i` is being added to `sChar`.

Therefore, the updated state is that `sChar` now contains one more element, which is `i`, and all other conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5, `sChar` now contains at least three such strings including the newly appended `i`.**
