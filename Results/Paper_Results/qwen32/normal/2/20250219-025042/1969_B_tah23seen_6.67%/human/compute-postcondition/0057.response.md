Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '0'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[4]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'; `left` is 3; `right` is 5; `len(s)` must be greater than 4**.

In simple terms, the `right` variable has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
