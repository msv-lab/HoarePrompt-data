To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop head:

```python
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as two conditions are met:
1. `right < len(s)`
2. `s[right] != '0'`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '1'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'.
- `left` is 2.
- `right` is `len(s)`.

Let's analyze the conditions:
1. `right < len(s)`: Since `right` is currently set to `len(s)`, this condition is not satisfied. To satisfy this condition, `right` needs to be less than `len(s)`.
2. `s[right] != '0'`: This condition is irrelevant if the first condition is not satisfied because the loop will not enter if `right` is not less than `len(s)`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `right` to be less than `len(s)`. The simplest way to do this is to decrement `right` by 1, making sure that `s[right]` is not '0'. Given the structure of `s` (where `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'), setting `right` to `len(s) - 1` would satisfy both conditions.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `right` should be `len(s) - 1`.

State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar` and `s[0]` is '0'; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '1'; `s[3]` is '1'; `s[len(s) - 1]` is '1'; `left` is 2; `right` is `len(s) - 1`**
