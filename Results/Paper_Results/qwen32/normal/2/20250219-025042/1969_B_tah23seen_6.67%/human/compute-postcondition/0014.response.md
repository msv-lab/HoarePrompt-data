The code snippet `cost += right - left + 1` increments the `cost` variable by the value of `right - left + 1`. Given the initial conditions, `right` is 1 and `left` is 0. Therefore, the increment to `cost` is `1 - 0 + 1`, which equals 2.

Thus, `cost` changes from 0 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements from `sChar`; `left` is 0; `cost` is 2; `right` is 1; `s[right]` is '1' and `s[left]` is '0'.**
