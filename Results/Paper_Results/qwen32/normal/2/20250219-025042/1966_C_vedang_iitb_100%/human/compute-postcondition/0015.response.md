Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If the previous `sz` was equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to `mexsize` + 1. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged. `sz` is the next element in the list `a`. `mexsize` is increased by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `mexsize` has been increased by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `sz`) remain unchanged.
