The given code snippet reads a new list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This means that the previous list stored in `a` is replaced by the new input list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`, `tc`) remain unchanged.

Since the new list `a` is read, `maxsize` and `mexsize` would need to be recalculated based on the new list, but the code does not perform these calculations. Therefore, `maxsize` and `mexsize` retain their previous values, which may no longer be accurate for the new list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the new sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the previous list `a`; `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the previous list `a`; `tc` is the value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**
