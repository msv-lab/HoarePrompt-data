Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules and optimal play strategy described in the problem statement. 

The key to solving this problem is to recognize that it is a variant of the Nim game, specifically the Grundy number (or Nim-sum) concept. In this game, the winning strategy depends on the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR of all pile sizes is zero, the position is losing for the player about to move (Alice in this case); otherwise, it is winning.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        xor_sum = 0
        for sz in a:
            xor_sum ^= sz
        if xor_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This program calculates the XOR of all pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the result is zero or not.
