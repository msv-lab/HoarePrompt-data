Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the sorted list of integers obtained from the input and has at least 1 element; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is 1; `tc` is the value of `tc` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `sz` equals `mexsize`.**
