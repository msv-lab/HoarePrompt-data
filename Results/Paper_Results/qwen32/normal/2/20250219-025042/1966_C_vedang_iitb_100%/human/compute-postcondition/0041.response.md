Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. **`n`**: Another input integer, presumably representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
3. **`a`**: A sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
4. **`maxsize`**: The maximum value in the list `a`.
5. **`mexsize`**: The smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
6. **Condition**: The current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.
7. **`tc`**: This variable is incremented by 1 (`tc = tc + 1`), but it does not affect the print statement directly.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
```

This statement checks if `mexsize` is even or odd:
- If `mexsize % 2 == 0` (i.e., `mexsize` is even), it prints `'Alice'`.
- Otherwise, it prints `'Bob'`.

### Key Insight:
Given that `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` and it is stated that `mexsize > maxsize`, we need to determine the parity (evenness or oddness) of `mexsize`.

Since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not in `a` and it is greater than the maximum value in `a`, it implies that all integers from 1 up to `maxsize` are present in `a`. Therefore, `mexsize` must be the next integer after `maxsize`.

For example:
- If `a` contains `[1, 2, 3]`, then `maxsize` is 3 and `mexsize` would be 4.
- If `a` contains `[1, 3, 4]`, then `maxsize` is 4 and `mexsize` would be 2.

In both cases, `mexsize` is determined by the sequence of numbers in `a` and will always be the smallest missing positive integer greater than `maxsize`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not in `a` and it is greater than `maxsize`, it means `mexsize` could be either even or odd depending on the specific sequence of numbers in `a`. However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact value of `mexsize`, only that it is greater than `maxsize`.

Thus, the output depends on the parity of `mexsize`, which is not explicitly given but can be either even or odd.

However, based on the structure of the problem and the given conditions, we can infer that the output will be either `'Alice'` or `'Bob'` depending on whether `mexsize` is even or odd.

### Final Output:
Output: **'Alice' if mexsize is even, otherwise 'Bob' (where mexsize is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` and greater than `maxsize`)**
