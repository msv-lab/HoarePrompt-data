The given code snippet increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. No other variables are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the only change in the state is the new value of `mexsize`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize` (which is initially 1), then `mexsize` is updated to 2, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`, `mexsize` is `mexsize` + 1.**
