The code snippet provided is `a.sort()`. This operation sorts the list `a` in ascending order. However, since the problem states that `a` is already a sorted list of integers, sorting it again does not change its order.

Therefore, the only variable that is affected by the `tc` increment, which is mentioned in the initial state description but not directly related to the code snippet provided, will be updated.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`; `tc` is `tc + 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `a` remains sorted as it was already sorted. The variable `tc` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their original values.
