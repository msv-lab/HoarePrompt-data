Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not take any direct parameters. It reads from standard input where the first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each subsequent line contains two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, the function returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the predefined string `s` (which is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`) repeated `n` times.**
