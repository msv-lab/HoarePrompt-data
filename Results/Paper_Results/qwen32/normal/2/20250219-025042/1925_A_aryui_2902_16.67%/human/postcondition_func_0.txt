The function reads from standard input, where the first line contains an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the predefined string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` repeated `n` times.
