To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the given Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `costs` is a list defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `curr` is set to `n`.
- `h` is updated to `h + n`.
- `n` is set to `0`.
- `i` is set to `1`.
- It is also mentioned that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Key Points:
- Since `n` is set to `0`, the list `costs` simplifies to `[0 - k + 1, 1]` which is `[-k + 1, 1]`.
- The values of `curr`, `h`, and `i` do not affect the `costs` list directly and are not used in the print statement.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*costs)
```

- The `*` operator unpacks the list `costs` so that each element is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.
- Therefore, `print(*costs)` will print the elements of the list `costs` separated by spaces.

### Calculation of `costs`:
- Given `n = 0`, the expression for `costs` becomes `[-k + 1, 1]`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the elements of the list `costs`, which are `-k + 1` and `1`.

Output: **-k + 1 1 (where k is a value such that h >= k)**
