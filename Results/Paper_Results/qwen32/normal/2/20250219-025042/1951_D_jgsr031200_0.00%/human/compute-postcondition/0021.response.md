The code `curr = n // i` updates the value of `curr` by performing integer division of `n` by `i`. Given the initial state, `n` is `0` and `i` is `1`. Therefore, `curr` becomes `0 // 1`, which is `0`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `curr` is `0`; `h` is `h + n`; `n` is `0`; `i` is `1`**
