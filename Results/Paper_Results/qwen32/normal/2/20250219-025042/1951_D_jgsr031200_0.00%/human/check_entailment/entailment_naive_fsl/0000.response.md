Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Function Call Error**: The function `func_1(n, k)` is called without being defined within the provided code snippet. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Setting Up Stalls**: The logic used to determine the prices for the stalls is incorrect. The current implementation sets up only two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` and checks if the total number of jewels bought equals `k`. This approach is too simplistic and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in all cases.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `n` is very large and `k` is small, the current logic might not be able to set up the stalls correctly to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Number of Stalls Constraint**: The problem specifies that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls. The current implementation does not ensure that the number of stalls is within this limit.

To correctly solve the problem, Bob needs to strategically set up the prices of the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible approach is to use a greedy strategy where the prices of the stalls are chosen in a way that maximizes the number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall while ensuring she buys exactly `k` jewels in total.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        continue
    
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        continue
    
    stalls = []
    remaining_jewels = k
    remaining_coins = n
    
    # Use binary search to find the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall
    for i in range(1, 61):
        if remaining_jewels == 0:
            break
        
        max_price = remaining_coins // remaining_jewels
        if max_price == 0:
            break
        
        stalls.append(max_price)
        remaining_jewels -= 1
        remaining_coins -= max_price
    
    if remaining_jewels == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(*stalls)
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of stalls is within the limit and that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It uses a greedy approach to set up the prices of the stalls.
