Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

### Output:
Based on the analysis, the output of the `print` statement is the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
