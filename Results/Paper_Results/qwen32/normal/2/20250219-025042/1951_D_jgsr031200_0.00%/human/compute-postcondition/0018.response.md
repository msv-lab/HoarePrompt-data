The code snippet `h += curr` increments the value of `h` by the value of `curr`. Given the initial state, `curr` is `n`. Therefore, `h` will be updated to its current value plus `n`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `curr` is `n`; `h` is `h + n`; `n` is `n - i * curr`; `i` is `1`**

In natural language, this means that `h` has been increased by the value of `n`, while all other variables retain their initial values or expressions.
