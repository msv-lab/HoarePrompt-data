The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It prints "YES" followed by 1 three times if `n` equals `k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it calculates a series of values and prints "NO" if a certain condition is not met; otherwise, it prints "2", "YES", and two specific values derived from `n` and `k`. The function does not return any value in any case.
