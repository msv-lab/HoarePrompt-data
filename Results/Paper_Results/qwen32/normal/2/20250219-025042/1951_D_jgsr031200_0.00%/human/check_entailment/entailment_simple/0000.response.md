### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up his jewelry store with at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. The program includes a function `func_1` that handles the logic for each test case. Let's analyze the correctness of the program step-by-step.

#### Key Points:
1. **Base Cases:**
   - If `n == k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by buying one jewel at a price of `1` coin. This is handled correctly.
   - If `n < k`, it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels because she doesn't have enough coins. This is also handled correctly.

2. **General Case:**
   - For the general case where `n > k`, the program attempts to construct a solution using two prices: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It calculates how many jewels Alice can buy at these prices and checks if the total number of jewels bought equals `k`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic for General Case:**
  - The logic used in the general case is flawed. The program only considers two prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`) and calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy at these prices. However, this approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
  - The program does not explore other possible combinations of prices and the number of stalls, which is necessary to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

- **Insufficient Exploration:**
  - The program does not attempt to create a combination of up to 60 different prices that would allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. Instead, it relies on a fixed set of two prices, which is insufficient to cover all possible scenarios.

- **Output Errors:**
  - When the program determines that Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels using the two prices, it prints "NO". However, it may incorrectly print "YES" followed by the prices when the actual solution might require a different combination of prices.

#### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1:** `n = 7`, `k = 3`
  - The program outputs "YES" with prices `2` and `1`. However, this is incorrect because Alice would buy more than 3 jewels with these prices.
  
- **Test Case 2:** `n = 6`, `k = 4`
  - The program correctly outputs "NO" because it is impossible to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with the given constraints.

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 255`, `k = 8`
  - The program outputs "YES" with prices `128`, `64`, `32`, `16`, `8`, `4`, `2`, and `1`. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly 8 jewels with these prices.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct for all cases due to its limited approach to solving the problem. It fails to explore all possible combinations of prices and the number of stalls, which is necessary to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
