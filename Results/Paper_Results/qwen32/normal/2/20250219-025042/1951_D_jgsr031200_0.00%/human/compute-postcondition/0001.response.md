Given the initial state where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`, the Python code snippet simply contains a `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k` at all. It directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
