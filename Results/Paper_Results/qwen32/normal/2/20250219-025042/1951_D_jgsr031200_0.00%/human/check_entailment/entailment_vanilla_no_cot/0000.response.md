Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Handling the Case When `n == k`:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `n == k`, then Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   
2. **Handling the Case When `n < k`:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `n < k`, it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels since she doesn't have enough coins.

3. **General Case (`n > k`):**
   - The logic in the general case is flawed. The program attempts to create a list `costs` with two elements `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then tries to use these costs to determine if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - The approach of using just two stalls and specific costs does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. It fails to consider the possibility of using up to 60 stalls with varying prices to achieve the desired number of jewels.

### Correct Approach:
- To ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, we need to carefully set up the stalls with appropriate prices. One way to do this is to use binary representation of `k` to determine the number of stalls and their prices.
- For example, if `k = 8`, we can set up stalls with prices corresponding to powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8), ensuring that Alice buys exactly 8 jewels.

### Example Fix:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    # Use binary representation to determine the number of stalls
    stalls = []
    remaining_k = k
    power_of_two = 1
    
    while remaining_k > 0:
        if remaining_k % 2 == 1:
            stalls.append(power_of_two)
        remaining_k //= 2
        power_of_two *= 2
    
    if len(stalls) > 60:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(*stalls)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)
```

This corrected program ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60 and that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by using the binary representation of `k`.
