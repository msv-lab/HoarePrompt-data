### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Game Mechanics Recap:
1. **Initial Setup**: Alice starts with `a` coins, and Bob starts with `b` coins.
2. **Turns**: Players alternate turns, starting with Alice.
3. **Actions**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
4. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when both wallets have 0 coins) loses.

#### Strategy Analysis:
The core insight in the problem is the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`|a - b|`).

- **Even Difference (`|a - b| % 2 == 0`)**:
  - If the difference is even, both players can mirror each other's moves. This means that whatever Alice does, Bob can do the same, ensuring that the difference remains even. Since they start with an even difference, they will eventually reach a state where both wallets have the same number of coins, and since Alice goes first, Bob will be the one to make the last move, leading to Bob's victory.
  
- **Odd Difference (`|a - b| % 2 != 0`)**:
  - If the difference is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position. By making the first move, Alice can ensure that the difference becomes even after her move. This puts Bob in the position described above, where he will eventually lose because Alice will be the last one to make a valid move.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code correctly implements this logic:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```
- The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b`.
- It calculates the absolute difference `abs(a - b)`.
- It checks the parity of the difference:
  - If the difference is even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
  - If the difference is odd (`abs(a - b) % 2 != 0`), it prints "Alice".

This matches exactly with the strategy analysis provided in the original assessment.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
