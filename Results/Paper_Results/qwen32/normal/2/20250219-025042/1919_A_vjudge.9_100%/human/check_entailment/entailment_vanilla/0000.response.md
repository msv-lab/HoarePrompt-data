### Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the optimal strategy for both players. Let's break down the game mechanics and the conditions under which each player can win.

1. **Initial Setup**: Alice starts with `a` coins, and Bob starts with `b` coins.
2. **Turns**: Players alternate turns, starting with Alice.
3. **Actions**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
4. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when both wallets have 0 coins) loses.

### Strategy Analysis:

- **Parity of Coin Difference**: The key insight here is the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
  - If `|a - b|` is even, it means that the players can always mirror each other's moves. For example, if Alice swaps, Bob can swap; if Alice doesn't swap, Bob doesn't swap. This way, the difference in the number of coins remains even throughout the game. Eventually, the game will reach a point where both wallets have the same number of coins, and since they start with an even difference, they will end up with zero coins simultaneously, making Bob the winner because Alice goes last.
  - If `|a - b|` is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position. By making the first move, Alice can ensure that the difference in the number of coins becomes even after her move, putting Bob in the position described above. Thus, Alice will be the last one to make a valid move and win the game.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. If the difference is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
