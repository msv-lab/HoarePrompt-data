The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer within a specific range, and the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd. However, the value of `t` and the condition about the absolute difference between `a` and `b` are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Here's the updated state after executing the code:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

Natural language description: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the condition regarding the absolute difference between `a` and `b` still holds. The variables `a` and `b` now hold the values read from the input. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
