Given the initial state, the key details are:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on any of these variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`). It simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Output: **Bob**
