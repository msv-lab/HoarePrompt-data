### Reasoning:
To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the optimal strategy for both players. The key insight here is that the game revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

1. **Initial Observation**: If `a == b`, then Alice and Bob will alternate removing coins until both wallets are empty, and Bob will win because he makes the last move.
2. **Parity Analysis**:
   - If `abs(a - b)` is even, Alice and Bob can always mirror each other's moves, ensuring that Bob ends up making the last move when the wallets are empty.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where `abs(a - b)` becomes even after her move, eventually leading to Bob being unable to make a valid move.

### Detailed Explanation:
- **Even Difference (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`)**:
  - Alice and Bob can mirror each other's moves perfectly.
  - For example, if `a = 4` and `b = 2`, Alice can swap and remove a coin, making it `a = 1` and `b = 3`. Bob can then swap and remove a coin, making it `a = 2` and `b = 2`. They continue this pattern until both wallets are empty, and Bob wins.
- **Odd Difference (`abs(a - b) % 2 != 0`)**:
  - Alice can always make a move that leaves an even difference for Bob.
  - For example, if `a = 5` and `b = 3`, Alice can remove a coin from her wallet, making it `a = 4` and `b = 3`. Now, `abs(a - b)` is even, and Bob is forced into the mirroring strategy, ultimately losing.

Given this analysis, the program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of `abs(a - b)`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Correctness: **True**
