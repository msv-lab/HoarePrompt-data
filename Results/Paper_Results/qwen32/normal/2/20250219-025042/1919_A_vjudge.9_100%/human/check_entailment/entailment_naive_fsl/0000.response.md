Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., whose wallet is empty) loses.
- Both players play optimally.
- Determine who will win given the initial number of coins in each player's wallet.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the following logic:
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
- It then checks if the absolute difference between the number of coins in their wallets (`abs(a - b)`) is even or odd.
- If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
- If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

### Correctness Verification:
To verify the correctness, we need to check if the logic correctly determines the winner for all possible inputs.

#### Key Insight:
The game can be analyzed using the concept of Grundy numbers (or Nimbers) from combinatorial game theory. However, a simpler observation can be made:
- If `a` and `b` are equal, Alice and Bob will always end up with zero coins simultaneously, and Bob will make the last move (since Alice goes first). Thus, Bob wins.
- If `a` and `b` are not equal, the player with more coins can always force the other player into a losing position by maintaining an imbalance until the other player is forced to make the last move. Thus, Alice wins if `a != b`.

This means:
- If `a == b`, Bob wins.
- If `a != b`, Alice wins.

This aligns with the program's logic:
- If `abs(a - b)` is even, it implies `a == b` (since the only way the absolute difference can be zero is if `a` and `b` are equal), and the program correctly outputs "Bob".
- If `abs(a - b)` is odd, it implies `a != b`, and the program correctly outputs "Alice".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on whether the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd, which directly corresponds to whether the number of coins are equal or not. This logic ensures that the program works correctly for all possible inputs within the constraints.
