The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t`, the absolute difference condition between `a` and `b`, and the increment of `i` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
