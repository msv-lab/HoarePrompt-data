The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. Since `t` is given as a constant integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and does not change during the loop iterations, we only need to adjust `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that the loop condition is `for i in range(t)`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `t`.

So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `x`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `x`, we can generalize it as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is `i + 1` from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

However, to be more precise in the context of the loop:

If `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is `x + 1`.**

Since we don't have the specific value of `x`, we can simply say:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

For clarity, let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is `x + 1`.**

Since we don't have the specific value of `x`, the most accurate general statement is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

For the sake of providing a concrete example, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is 3.**

But generally:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

So the final answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
