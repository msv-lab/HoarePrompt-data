Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the value of the integer input by the user, which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1000 inclusive. All other conditions and constraints regarding the test cases remain unchanged.
