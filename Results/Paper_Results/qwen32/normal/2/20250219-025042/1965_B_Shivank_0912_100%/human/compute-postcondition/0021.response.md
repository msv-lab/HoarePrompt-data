The code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` already contains certain elements depending on whether `j` equals `i`. After appending `1 << j`, the list `ans` will include this new element.

Since `j` is defined as `x + 2`, the value `1 << j` is `1` shifted left by `j` bits, which is equivalent to \(2^j\).

Therefore, the updated `ans` will be:
- If `j` equals `i`, `ans` was initially `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`. After appending `1 << j`, `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]`.
- If `j` does not equal `i`, `ans` was initially `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]`. After appending `1 << j` again, `ans` becomes `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j, 1 << j]`.

However, since the problem specifies that `ans` already includes `1 << j` if `j` is not equal to `i`, the correct interpretation is that `ans` will simply have one additional element `1 << j` appended to it in both cases.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an integer; `k` is unchanged; `i` is \(\lfloor \log_2(k) \rfloor\); `ans` is \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]\) if `j` equals `i`, otherwise `ans` is \([k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j, 1 << j]\); `j` is \(x + 2\)**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `ans` now includes an additional element `1 << j` appended to it, regardless of whether `j` equals `i` or not.
