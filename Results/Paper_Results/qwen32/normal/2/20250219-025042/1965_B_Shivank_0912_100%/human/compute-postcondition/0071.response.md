To determine the final state of the `ans` list after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `ans` list. The loop iterates 20 times, and during each iteration, it appends `1 << j` to the `ans` list if `j` is not equal to `i`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans` starts with `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{(i + 1)} \leq k\).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `j` from 0 to 19.
   - For each `j`, if `j` is not equal to `i`, `1 << j` is appended to `ans`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `ans` will contain the initial three elements plus `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 except `i`.

Let's formalize this:

- Initial `ans`: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`
- Elements added to `ans` during the loop: `[1 << j for j in range(20) if j != i]`

Thus, the final `ans` list will be:
\[ \text{ans} = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)] + [1 << j \text{ for } j \in \{0, 1, \ldots, 19\} \setminus \{i\}] \]

This means `ans` will include all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{19}\) except \(2^i\), along with the initial three elements.

**Output State: **[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072] excluding \(2^i\)**.

In natural language, the final output state is that `ans` contains the initial three elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by all powers of 2 from 1 to \(2^{19}\) except \(2^i\).
