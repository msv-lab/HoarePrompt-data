Postcondition: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1]` if `j` does not equal `i`; otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2]`. `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `i` is the largest integer such that \(1 \ll (i + 1) \leq k\), and `j` is 1.**
