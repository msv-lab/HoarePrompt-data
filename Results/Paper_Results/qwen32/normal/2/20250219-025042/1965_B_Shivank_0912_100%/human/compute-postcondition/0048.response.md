Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
- We have a list that includes the following elements:
  - \( k - (1 << i) \)
  - \( k + 1 \)
  - \( k + 1 + (1 << i) \)
  - The numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072
- The list excludes \( 2^i \).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(ans))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the List Elements**:
   - The list contains specific values derived from \( k \) and \( i \):
     - \( k - (1 << i) \)
     - \( k + 1 \)
     - \( k + 1 + (1 << i) \)
   - It also contains a sequence of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{17} \).
   
2. **Exclude \( 2^i \)**:
   - One of these powers of 2, specifically \( 2^i \), is excluded from the list.

3. **Count the Total Number of Elements**:
   - The sequence of powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{17} \) contains 18 elements.
   - Adding the three additional elements \( k - (1 << i) \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 1 + (1 << i) \) brings the total to 21 elements.
   - Since one element (\( 2^i \)) is excluded, the final count of elements in the list is \( 21 - 1 = 20 \).

4. **Determine the Length of `ans`**:
   - Given the context, it appears that `ans` is the list described in the initial state.
   - Therefore, the length of `ans` is 20.

### Final Output:
The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the number of elements in the list `ans`, which is 20.

Output: **20**
