To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `1 << i + 1 <= k`.

Given the current state:
- `tc` is 2
- `n` is the first integer from input
- `k` must be at least 2
- `i` is 1

Let's break down the condition `1 << i + 1 <= k`:

1. `1 << i` shifts the number 1 to the left by `i` positions, which is equivalent to \(2^i\).
2. `1 << i + 1` shifts the number 1 to the left by `i + 1` positions, which is equivalent to \(2^{i+1}\).

So the condition becomes \(2^{i+1} \leq k\).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, the condition becomes \(2^{1+1} \leq k\) or \(2^2 \leq k\) or \(4 \leq k\).

Since `k` must be at least 2, but the condition requires `k` to be at least 4 for the loop to execute again, we need to adjust `k` to be at least 4.

No other variables in the loop condition (`i` and `k`) need to be adjusted further as long as `k` is at least 4 and `i` remains 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072], `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` must be at least 4, `i` is 1]**
