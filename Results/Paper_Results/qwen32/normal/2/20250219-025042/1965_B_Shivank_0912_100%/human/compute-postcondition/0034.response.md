The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so now `i` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072], `tc` is 2, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` must be at least 5, `i` is 3]**
