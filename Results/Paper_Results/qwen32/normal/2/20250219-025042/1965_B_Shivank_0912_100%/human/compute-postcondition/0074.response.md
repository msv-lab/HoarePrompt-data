To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how each iteration of the loop contributes to the output. Each iteration processes a pair of integers \( n \) and \( k \), and generates a list of numbers based on the value of \( k \).

Here's a breakdown of what happens in each iteration:

1. **Determine \( i \)**: The variable \( i \) is determined by finding the largest integer such that \( 2^{i+1} \leq k \). This means \( i \) is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \).

2. **Generate the List**:
   - Start with three elements: \( k - 2^i \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 1 + 2^i \).
   - Then, append powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) up to \( 2^{19} \), excluding \( 2^i \).

3. **Print the Length and the List**: For each test case, the length of the list and the list itself are printed.

Since the problem specifies that the loop runs \( t \) times, and each iteration outputs a list of 21 numbers (3 specific numbers plus 18 powers of 2 excluding one), the final output will consist of the concatenation of these lists for each test case.

Given that the output state after the first 3 iterations is described as the same list excluding \( 2^i \) for each iteration, we can infer that the final output state will be a concatenation of such lists for all \( t \) iterations.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations will be a series of concatenated lists, each following the same pattern described above.

Output State: **A series of concatenated lists, each containing 21 numbers: [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072] excluding \(2^i\) for each test case.**

In simpler terms, the final output will be a long sequence of numbers where each block of 21 numbers corresponds to the output of one iteration of the loop, with the appropriate power of 2 excluded based on the value of \( k \) for that iteration.
