Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
  1. There is no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
  2. For every integer `v` (where `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`), there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to `k`:**
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
   - The loop `while 1 << i + 1 <= k:` increments `i` until `2^(i+1)` exceeds `k`. This means `2^i` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence:**
   - The sequence `ans` is initialized with three elements:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This ensures that we can form sums up to `k-1` but not `k` itself.
     - `k + 1`: This value is greater than `k`, ensuring no subsequence involving this element will sum to `k`.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: Another value greater than `k` for additional flexibility.
   - The loop `for j in range(20):` appends powers of 2 (`1 << j`) to `ans`, except when `j == i`. This is to ensure that we can form all sums up to `n` except `k`.

### Verification Against Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Sums to `k`:**
   - By construction, the sequence avoids having any combination of elements that sum exactly to `k`. Specifically, `k - (1 << i)` ensures that the highest sum we can get close to `k` is `k-1`.

2. **All Other Sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) are Possible:**
   - The inclusion of various powers of 2 allows us to form any sum through combinations, except for `k` due to the specific exclusion of `1 << i` in the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program constructs a sequence that meets the requirements of the problem statement. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) to be formed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
