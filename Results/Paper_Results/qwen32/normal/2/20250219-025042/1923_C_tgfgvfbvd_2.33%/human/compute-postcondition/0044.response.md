The code snippet provided reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This means the values of `n` and `m` will be updated based on the user's input, while the other variables (`t`, `l`, `p`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.**
