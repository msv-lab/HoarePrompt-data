Output State: **All test cases have been processed, and for each query in every test case, either 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed based on the condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it will have computed the cumulative sums of the list `l` and used these sums to evaluate each of the `m` queries. For each query, it checks if the sum of the specified subarray is at least twice the length of that subarray. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This process continues until all test cases and their respective queries have been handled.
