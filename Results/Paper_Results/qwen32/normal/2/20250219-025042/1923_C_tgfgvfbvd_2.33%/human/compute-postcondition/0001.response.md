The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), inclusive, but `t` is not used in the given code snippet. Therefore, the value of `t` remains unchanged.

After executing the code, `n` and `m` will hold the values of the two integers read from the input. Since the exact values of these integers are not specified in the initial state, we can only say that they are the integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are the two integers provided by the user input.**
