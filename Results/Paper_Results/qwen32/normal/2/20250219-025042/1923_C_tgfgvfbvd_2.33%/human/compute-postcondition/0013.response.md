The code appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged. The value of `c` is increased by the value of `x` before appending, but since the increment operation is mentioned in the initial state and not in the provided code snippet, we only reflect the append operation in our output.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are the two integers provided by the user input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must contain at least one integer; `x` is the next element in the list `l`; `c` is increased by the value of `x`; `p` contains the new element `c`.**
