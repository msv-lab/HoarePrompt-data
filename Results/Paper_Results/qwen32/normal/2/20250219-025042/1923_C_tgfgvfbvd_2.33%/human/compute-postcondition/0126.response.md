Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer.
- `m` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward. It simply prints the string `'NO'`. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, `s`) are used in this particular `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
