The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.**
