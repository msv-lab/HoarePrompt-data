Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and their descriptions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`: An integer.
   - `m`: Greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.
   - `l`: A list of integers.
   - `p`: A list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c`: The sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `a` and `b`: Integers read from the input.
   - `s`: Calculated based on the conditions involving `a` and `b`.

2. **Calculation of `s`:**
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s = p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
   - Otherwise, `s = p[b - 1]`.

### Code Snippet:

```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or expressions involved in this particular `print` statement that depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, or `s`. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.

### Conclusion:

The output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
