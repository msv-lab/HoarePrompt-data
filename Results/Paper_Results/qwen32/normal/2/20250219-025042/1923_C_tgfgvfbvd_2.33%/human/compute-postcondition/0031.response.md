The given Python code snippet contains only a single `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of any other variables or conditions in the initial state. The initial state provides details about several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `s`), but none of these affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information from the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, with `m` being at least 1.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
- `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by the latest user input.
- `s` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `b` and the list `p`.

However, none of these variables influence the `print('YES')` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
