The code snippet `s -= p[a - 2]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting `p[a - 2]` from it. Given the initial state, `s` was initially set to `p[b - 1]`. After the operation, `s` will now hold the value `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `a` and `b` are integers provided by the latest user input; `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**
