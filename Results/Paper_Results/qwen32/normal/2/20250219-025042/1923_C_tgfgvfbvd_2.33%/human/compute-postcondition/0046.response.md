The code snippet `p = []` reassigns the variable `p` to an empty list. This means that the previous value of `p`, which was a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in the original `l`, is now replaced by an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is an empty list; `c` is the sum of all elements in the original `l`.**
