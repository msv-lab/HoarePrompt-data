To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variables and Lists**:
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `n`: An integer.
   - `m`: An integer greater than 0.
   - `l`: A list of integers.
   - `p`: A list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c`: The sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `a` and `b`: Integers read from the input.

2. **Conditions for `s`**:
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, then the current value of `s` satisfies the condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`.
   - Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is not greater than 1 or `s` is less than `2 * (b - a + 1)`.
   - If `a - 2 < 0`, then `s` remains `p[b - 1]`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print('NO')` statement is executed regardless of the conditions above.

Given these details, the `print('NO')` statement will always execute and print "NO" because there are no conditions that would prevent it from executing. The value of `s` and the other variables do not affect the execution of this specific print statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
