### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine whether a specified subarray of the array `c` is "good" according to the provided criteria. Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly implements these criteria.

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the array `c`. This is done to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray in constant time after the initial O(n) computation.
   - `p[i]` stores the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `c`.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l_i ... r_i]` using the prefix sums.
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, it adjusts the sum to exclude elements before the start of the subarray.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - `b - a + 1 > 1`: This ensures that the subarray has more than one element.
     - `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`: This condition is crucial. It ensures that the sum of the subarray is at least twice its length. This is necessary because if the sum of the subarray is less than twice its length, it would be impossible to construct an array `b` such that `b_i > 0` for all `i` and `a_i â‰  b_i` for all `i` while maintaining the same sum.

3. **Output:**
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the program outputs "YES", indicating that the subarray is good.
   - Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Array `c = [1, 2, 1, 4, 5]`
  - Prefix sums `p = [1, 3, 4, 8, 13]`
  - Queries:
    - `1 5`: Subarray `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]` with sum `13`. Length `5`. Since `13 >= 2 * 5`, output is "YES".
    - `4 4`: Subarray `[4]` with sum `4`. Length `1`. Since the length is not greater than `1`, output is "NO".
    - `3 4`: Subarray `[1, 4]` with sum `5`. Length `2`. Since `5 >= 2 * 2`, output is "YES".
    - `1 3`: Subarray `[1, 2, 1]` with sum `4`. Length `3`. Since `4 < 2 * 3`, output is "NO".

The program's logic correctly handles these queries and produces the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given criteria. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
