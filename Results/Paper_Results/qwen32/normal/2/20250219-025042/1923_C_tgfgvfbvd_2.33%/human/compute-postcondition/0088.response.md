The given code snippet updates the list `l` by reading new integer values from user input. This means the original values of `l`, `p`, and `c` become invalid as they were based on the previous list `l`. Since `l` is reassigned, `p` (cumulative sums) and `c` (total sum) need to be recalculated based on the new `l`.

However, the problem statement does not specify that `p` and `c` should be recalculated automatically after `l` changes. Therefore, we only update `l` in our output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in the previous `l`; `c` is the total sum of all elements in the previous `l`.** 

In simpler terms: The list `l` is updated to the new list of integers provided by the user input. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged from their previous states except for `l`.
