The code appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is initialized to `n`, after the operation, `p` will contain the single element `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are the two integers provided by the user input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must contain at least one integer; `p` is a list containing the single element `n`; `c` is `n`.**
