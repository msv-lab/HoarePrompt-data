The code snippet `k -= s` reduces the value of `k` by the value of `s`. Given the initial state, `k` was originally `k - s`, and now it will be further reduced by `s`.

Let's break down the changes:
- Initially, `k` was `k - s`.
- After executing `k -= s`, `k` becomes `(k - s) - s`, which simplifies to `k - 2s`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `k - 2s`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the smaller of `m` and `k`, `c` is `k * k / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
