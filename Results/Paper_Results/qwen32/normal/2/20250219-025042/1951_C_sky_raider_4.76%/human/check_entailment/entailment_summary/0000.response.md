### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly implements the solution to the problem described.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days.
- Each day, we can buy up to `m` tickets.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.
- We aim to minimize the total cost of purchasing `k` tickets.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        s = 0
        c = k * k / 2
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
        print(int(c))
```

##### Key Points:
1. **Sorting**: The list `l` (prices) is sorted. This is a good start because buying cheaper tickets first minimizes the cost.
2. **Initialization**: `s` is initialized to `0` and `c` to `k * k / 2`. The initialization of `c` seems arbitrary and doesn't align with the problem's requirements.
3. **Loop Through Days**: The loop iterates through each day, attempting to buy tickets.
   - `s` is set to the minimum of `m` (max tickets per day) and `k` (remaining tickets to buy).
   - `k` is decremented by `s`.
   - `c` is updated by adding the cost of `s` tickets on the current day (`l[i] * s`) minus `s * s / 2`. The subtraction of `s * s / 2` is incorrect and doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

##### Issues:
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The term `- s * s / 2` in the cost calculation is incorrect. It appears to be an attempt to adjust the cost, but it doesn't align with the problem's rules.
- **Initialization of `c`**: Initializing `c` to `k * k / 2` is incorrect. The cost should start at `0`.

##### Correct Approach:
- Initialize `cost` to `0`.
- Iterate through the sorted list of prices.
- For each day, buy up to `m` tickets or the remaining `k` tickets, whichever is smaller.
- Update the cost by adding the price of the tickets bought.
- Increase the price for subsequent days accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The cost calculation is incorrect, and the initialization of the cost variable is also incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
