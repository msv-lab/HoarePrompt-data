Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{int(num)} \leq 10^9\), `tot` is 2, `i` is `len(num) - 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `num`, `tot`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without altering these variables.
