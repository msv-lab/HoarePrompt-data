To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` and `zerocnts` aligns with the rules and objective of the game described in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Problem:
1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - **Anna's Turn**: She reverses the digits of a chosen number, removing any leading zeros.
   - **Sasha's Turn**: He concatenates two different numbers in any order and replaces them with the resulting number.
   - **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if the final number is at least \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - **Anna's Move**: Reversing digits can potentially reduce the length of a number (e.g., 100 -> 1).
   - **Sasha's Move**: Concatenation increases the length of the number.
   - **Objective**: Determine who wins if both players play optimally.

3. **Strategy Insight**:
   - If the total number of significant digits (excluding trailing zeros) in the list is large enough, Sasha can concatenate numbers to reach a number with at least \(m\) digits.
   - Trailing zeros in numbers do not contribute to the length of the final number after concatenation, so they are irrelevant to the winning condition.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
- **Function `zerocnts(num)`**:
  - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in a number.
  - It correctly identifies the number of trailing zeros, which are irrelevant to the final length of the number after concatenation.

- **Function `func_1(n, m, nums)`**:
  - It calculates the total number of significant digits (`tot`) by summing up the lengths of the string representations of the numbers.
  - It sorts the numbers based on the count of trailing zeros in descending order.
  - It iteratively subtracts the trailing zeros of every other number (starting from the first) from the total significant digits.
  - It checks if the remaining significant digits (`tot`) are at least \(m + 1\) to determine the winner.

### Flaws in the Logic:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Significant Digits**:
  - The code incorrectly assumes that subtracting trailing zeros from every other number provides a valid way to determine the final significant digits.
  - The strategy should focus on the total number of significant digits, not just the subtraction of trailing zeros.

- **Misinterpretation of Winning Condition**:
  - The condition `tot >= m + 1` is incorrect. The correct condition should be checking if the total number of significant digits is at least \(m\).

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the problem's rules. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
