The code snippet increments the value of `tot` by 1. The values of `num`, `i`, and the condition related to `num[i]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{int(num)} \leq 10^9\), `tot` is 3, `i` is `len(num) - 3`. If `num[i]` is not '0', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
