Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the game rules described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why:

1. **Game Mechanics**: 
   - **Anna's Turn**: She reverses the digits of a chosen number, removing any leading zeros.
   - **Sasha's Turn**: He concatenates two different numbers in any order and inserts the result back into the list.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - Sasha wins if the final number is not less than \(10^m\).

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - `func_1` calculates the total length of all numbers in the list after removing trailing zeros (which is not the correct operation for Anna's turn).
   - It then iteratively subtracts the counts of trailing zeros from the total length, considering pairs of numbers.
   - Finally, it checks if the remaining total length is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\) to determine the winner.

4. **Issues**:
   - **Incorrect Handling of Anna's Turn**: The code does not actually reverse the digits of the numbers, nor does it handle leading zeros correctly for Anna's turn.
   - **Incorrect Handling of Sasha's Turn**: The code does not simulate Sasha's concatenation operation. It only considers the length of numbers and trailing zeros, which does not reflect the actual game mechanics.
   - **Winning Condition Misinterpretation**: The code checks the total length of numbers after removing trailing zeros, which is not the same as checking the value of the final concatenated number.

5. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     2 2
     14 2
     ```
   - According to the problem, Anna can reverse either 14 to 41 or 2 to 2. If she reverses 14 to 41, Sasha can concatenate 41 and 2 to get 412, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). So, Sasha wins.
   - However, the code will not correctly simulate this scenario because it does not properly handle the digit reversal and concatenation operations.

Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the game rules and winning conditions as described in the problem statement. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
