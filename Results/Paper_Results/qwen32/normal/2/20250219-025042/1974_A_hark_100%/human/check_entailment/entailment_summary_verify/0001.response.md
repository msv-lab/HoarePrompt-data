### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary provided.

#### Key Points:
1. **Grid Size**: Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
2. **Icon Sizes**:
   - 1x1 icons occupy 1 cell.
   - 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` handles multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of screens required based on the counts of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
- The logic for different cases is described in the summary.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**
   - The program calculates `bxsfory` as `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is correct for determining the minimum number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
   - The subsequent logic for adjusting `x` and calculating `bxsfory1` is flawed:
     - The expression `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. Subtracting `bxsfory * 15` implies that each screen used for 2x2 icons is fully occupied, which is not necessarily true. Instead, we need to calculate the exact number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons and then determine how many cells are left for 1x1 icons.
     - The addition of `y * 4` is redundant and incorrect because the cells occupied by 2x2 icons are already accounted for.

2. **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**
   - The program correctly calculates `math.ceil(y / 2)` because each screen can hold at most 2 2x2 icons.

3. **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**
   - The program correctly calculates `math.ceil(x / 15)` because each screen can hold at most 15 1x1 icons.

4. **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**
   - The program correctly prints `0` because no screens are needed.

#### Correct Approach:
To fix the logic for Case 1, we need to:
- Calculate the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons: `occupied_cells_by_2x2 = y * 4`.
- Determine the remaining cells available after placing 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = bxsfory * 15 - occupied_cells_by_2x2`.
- Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons: `additional_screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15)` if `remaining_cells < x`, otherwise `0`.
- The total number of screens is `bxsfory + additional_screens_for_1x1`.

However, the current implementation does not follow this logic, leading to incorrect results for some cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the logic for handling cases where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

**Final: False**
