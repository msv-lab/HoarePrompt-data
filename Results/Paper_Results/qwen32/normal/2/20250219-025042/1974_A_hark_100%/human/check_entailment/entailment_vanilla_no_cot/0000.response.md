Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of screens required. Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` does not correctly account for the space used by the 2x2 icons when calculating the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

Here's a corrected version of the logic:

1. Calculate the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.
2. Determine how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. If there are still 1x1 icons left after filling the remaining space, calculate additional screens needed for them.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
        # Total cells occupied by 2x2 icons
        cells_occupied_by_2x2 = y * 4
        # Remaining cells on these screens
        remaining_cells_on_2x2_screens = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - cells_occupied_by_2x2
        # Remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed
        remaining_1x1_icons = x - remaining_cells_on_2x2_screens
        # Additional screens needed for remaining 1x1 icons
        if remaining_1x1_icons > 0:
            additional_screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(remaining_1x1_icons / 15)
        else:
            additional_screens_for_1x1 = 0
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        print(total_screens)

func_1()
```

This corrected code properly accounts for the space occupied by 2x2 icons and calculates the additional screens needed for any leftover 1x1 icons.
