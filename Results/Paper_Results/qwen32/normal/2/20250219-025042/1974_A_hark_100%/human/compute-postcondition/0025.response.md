To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `ap` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x` and `y` are two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
- `k` is incremented by 1 (though `k` is not used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

### Analysis:
- The `math.ceil()` function rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
- The expression inside the `math.ceil()` function is `y / 2`.

Given that `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, inclusive, the value of `y / 2` will be a floating-point number between 0.0 and 49.5, inclusive.

When `math.ceil(y / 2)` is evaluated:
- If `y` is even, `y / 2` is already an integer, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will return `y / 2`.
- If `y` is odd, `y / 2` is not an integer, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will round it up to the next whole number.

### Example Calculations:
- If `y = 0`, then `y / 2 = 0.0` and `math.ceil(0.0) = 0`.
- If `y = 1`, then `y / 2 = 0.5` and `math.ceil(0.5) = 1`.
- If `y = 2`, then `y / 2 = 1.0` and `math.ceil(1.0) = 1`.
- If `y = 3`, then `y / 2 = 1.5` and `math.ceil(1.5) = 2`.
- If `y = 98`, then `y / 2 = 49.0` and `math.ceil(49.0) = 49`.
- If `y = 99`, then `y / 2 = 49.5` and `math.ceil(49.5) = 50`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement depends on the value of `y`. Specifically, it will print the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is an integer between 0 and 99, inclusive)**
