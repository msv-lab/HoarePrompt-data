Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts with a call to `func_1()`, which is defined later. This is unusual but not incorrect.
   - `func_1()` reads the number of test cases (`ap`) from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Logic for Placing Icons:**
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**
     - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`. This represents the minimum number of screens needed to place `y` 2x2 icons since each screen can hold at most 2 2x2 icons.
     - It then adjusts `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, `bxsfory * 4` cells are used, and the remaining cells are `15 - 4*bxsfory` per screen, but this logic seems flawed) and adding `y * 4` (which is redundant and incorrect because `y * 4` cells are already accounted for in `bxsfory * 4`).
     - It calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the adjusted `x` divided by 15. This represents the minimum number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - It prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
     
     **Issue:** The logic for adjusting `x` is incorrect. Subtracting `bxsfory * 15` and adding `y * 4` does not correctly account for the space taken by 2x2 icons. Instead, it should directly calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons.

   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**
     - It calculates and prints the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is correct since each screen can hold at most 2 2x2 icons.
   
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**
     - It calculates and prints the ceiling of `x / 15`, which is correct since each screen can hold at most 15 1x1 icons.
   
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**
     - It prints 0, which is correct since no screens are needed.

### Conclusion

The program has a logical error in handling the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. The adjustment of `x` is incorrect, leading to potential wrong results.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program is not entirely correct.

**Correctness: False**
