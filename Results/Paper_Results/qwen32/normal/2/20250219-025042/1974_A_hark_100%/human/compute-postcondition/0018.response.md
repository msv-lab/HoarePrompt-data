Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `x` is updated to `x - (ceiling(y / 2) * 15) + (y * 4)`, `y` remains unchanged, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is the ceiling of `x / 15` if `x > 0` else 0. Otherwise, if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, `x` remains 0 and `y` remains greater than 0. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, `x` remains greater than 0 and `y` remains 0. In all other cases, either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, and it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0.**
