Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, and both `x` and `y` are greater than 0; `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.**

In simple terms, the value of `bxsfory` is now set to the smallest integer greater than or equal to half of `y`. All other variables retain their initial values.
