Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `y` are the integers read from the input, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `x == 0 and y > 0`, the behavior is as described in the if part. Regardless of whether the if condition is true or false, the values of `t`, `ap`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and `k` is incremented by 1.**
