Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a string provided by user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, then the current value of `cnt1` remains unchanged. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and odd, then the current value of `cnt1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `s` contains the substring '11', then `cnt1` is at least 2 and either `cnt1` is even or `cnt1` is exactly 2. Otherwise, `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is even, or `cnt1` is exactly 1, and the substring '11' is not in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new string provided by user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new string `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the behavior is as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the new string provided by user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new string `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the if part is executed. Otherwise, the else part is executed. In both cases, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
