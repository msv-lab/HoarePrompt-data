The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution directly. However, the loop's continuation depends on the value of `t`. Since `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to adjust `t` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer read from input (1 <= t <= 100) minus 1
- `n` is a new positive integer read from input (1 <= n <= 100)
- `s` is a new string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" as read from the input
- `cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first being the original tuple and the second being `(n, s)`

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than or equal to 1. Since `t` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be the current value of `t` plus 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is a positive integer read from input (1 <= t <= 100), `n` is a new positive integer read from input (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a new string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" as read from the input, `cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first being the original tuple and the second being `(n, s)`**
