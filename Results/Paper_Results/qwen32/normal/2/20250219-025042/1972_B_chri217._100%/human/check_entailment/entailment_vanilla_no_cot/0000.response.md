To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic behind the solution and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
- The game involves a circular arrangement of coins, each either facing up ('U') or down ('D').
- Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
- The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins left.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- We need to determine if Alice (who starts first) will win if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:
- The game state is determined by the number of facing-up coins.
- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by playing optimally.
- If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by playing optimally.

### Program Analysis:
- `func_1()` reads the input and stores the test cases.
- `func_2(case)` calculates the number of facing-up coins (`ups`) in the current test case.
- It returns 'YES' if the number of facing-up coins is odd, indicating Alice wins; otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating Bob wins.

### Conclusion:
The logic implemented in `func_2(case)` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. This aligns with the key observations made above.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your Response:
Correctness: **True**
