The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use). However, since the loop runs `t` times, we need to adjust `t` to reflect the remaining iterations.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was a positive integer representing the number of iterations left. Since one iteration has just completed, `t` should be decremented by 1 for the next iteration to occur.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is a positive integer read from input (1 <= t <= 100) minus 1, `n` is a new positive integer read from input (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" as read from the input, `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`**
