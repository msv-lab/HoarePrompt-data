Given the initial state, we have the following information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `s2` is a permutation of the characters in `s`.
- `s` is explicitly stated to be equal to `s2`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('No')
```

This print statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **No**
