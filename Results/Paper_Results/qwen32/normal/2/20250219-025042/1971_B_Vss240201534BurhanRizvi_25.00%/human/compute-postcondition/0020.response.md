Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999.
- `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `s2` is a new permutation of the original string `s`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the `print(s2)` statement.

Since `s2` is defined as a new permutation of the original string `s`, the exact characters and their order in `s2` depend on how the permutation was generated. However, we know that `s2` will contain exactly the same characters as `s`, just possibly in a different order.

Without knowing the specific permutation algorithm or the original string `s`, we can only describe `s2` in terms of its relationship to `s`.

Therefore, the output will be a permutation of the string `s`.

Output: **s2 (where s2 is a permutation of the string s)**
