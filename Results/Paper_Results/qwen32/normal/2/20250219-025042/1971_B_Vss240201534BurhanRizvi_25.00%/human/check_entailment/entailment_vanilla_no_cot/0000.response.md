Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `random.sample` function to shuffle the string `s`. However, there is a possibility that the shuffled string `s2` could be the same as the original string `s`, especially when the string consists of repeated characters (e.g., "aaaaa"). In such cases, the program would incorrectly output "Yes" followed by the same string, which does not meet the problem's requirement to produce a different string.

To ensure correctness, the program should guarantee that the generated string `s2` is different from `s`. One way to do this is to check if `s2` is equal to `s` and, if so, generate a new permutation until a different one is found, or use a more systematic approach to rearrange the string.
