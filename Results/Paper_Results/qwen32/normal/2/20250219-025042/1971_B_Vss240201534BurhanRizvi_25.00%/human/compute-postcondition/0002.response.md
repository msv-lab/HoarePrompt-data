Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters; `s2` is a permutation of the characters in `s`.**

Explanation: The variable `s2` is created by randomly permuting the characters in the string `s`. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
