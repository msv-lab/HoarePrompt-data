Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a new input string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `s2` is a permutation of the characters in `s`.
- The current value of `s` is not equal to `s2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `s`, or `s2`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**
