Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `pans` is a list containing `[n - 1]` if `s` is equal to `'='`, otherwise `pans` is an empty list, `mak` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `i` is `n - 1`, and `s` is the input string which is not equal to `'<'`.**
