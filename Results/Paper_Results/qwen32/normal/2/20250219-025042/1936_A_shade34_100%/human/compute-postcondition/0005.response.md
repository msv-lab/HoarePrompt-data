The given Python code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call forces the output buffer to be written to the standard output (usually the console), but it does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `n` is assigned the value of `t`
- `mak` is 0

Since `sys.stdout.flush()` does not modify any variables, the values of `t`, `n`, and `mak` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `mak` is 0**.
