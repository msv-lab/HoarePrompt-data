The code snippet sets the variable `mak` to 0. This change does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, or `i`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak` is 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='`, `i` is `n-1`.**
