To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 3.
- `n` is assigned the value of `t`.
- `i` is assigned the value 4.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement contains the following elements:
  - `'?'`: This is a literal string.
  - `mak`: This variable is referenced twice in the print statement.
  - `i`: This variable is referenced twice in the print statement.

### Variable Values:
- `i` is explicitly given as 4.
- `mak` is not mentioned in the initial state, so its value is unknown based on the provided information.

### Conclusion:
- Since the value of `mak` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact value.
- The value of `i` is known to be 4.

Given this information, the output will include the literal string `'?'`, two occurrences of the unknown value `mak`, and two occurrences of the known value `i` (which is 4).

### Final Output:
Output: **? mak mak 4 4 (where mak is the value of the variable mak)**
