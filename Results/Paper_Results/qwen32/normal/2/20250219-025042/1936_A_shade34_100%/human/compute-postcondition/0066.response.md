To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t`, `n`, and `mak2` are mentioned but their specific values are not provided. Since they are not used in the print statement, we can ignore them for this task.
- `pans` is a list with at least three elements.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. This implies that `i` is an index that changes with each iteration, but we do not know its exact value here.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

#### Variables Involved:
- `'?'`: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- `pans[mak]`: This will print the element at index `mak` in the list `pans`.
- `pans[i]`: This will print the element at index `i` in the list `pans`.

### Determining Values:
- Since the exact values of `mak` and `i` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact elements of `pans` that will be printed.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of these indices.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output a question mark followed by two occurrences of the element at index `mak` in the list `pans`, and then two occurrences of the element at index `i` in the list `pans`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where mak and i are indices and pans is the list with at least three elements)**
