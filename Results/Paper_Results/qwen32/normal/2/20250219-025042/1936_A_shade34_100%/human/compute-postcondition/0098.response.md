The code snippet reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `mak`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, `pans` is an empty list, `mak` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, `s` is the input string.**
