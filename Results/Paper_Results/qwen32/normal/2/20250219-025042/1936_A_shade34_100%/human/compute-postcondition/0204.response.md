The code assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Given that `i` is `n-1`, `mak` will now hold the value `n-1`.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `n-1`.**
