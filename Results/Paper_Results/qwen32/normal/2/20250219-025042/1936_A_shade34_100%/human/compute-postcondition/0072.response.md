The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered data is written to the console. However, this operation does not affect any of the variables in the given initial state.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, `mak`) are altered by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` is unchanged, `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the input was '>' when compared to the previous `mak` element, or 0 if no such comparison resulted in '>'**.
