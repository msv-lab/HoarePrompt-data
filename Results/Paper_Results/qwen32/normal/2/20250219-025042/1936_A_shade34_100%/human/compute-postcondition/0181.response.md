Let's break down the given initial state and analyze the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is unchanged (its value is not specified, so we won't consider it further).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
- `pans` is `[n - 1]` if `s` is equal to `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` is an empty list.
- `mak` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is the input string.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement includes the following values:
  - `'?'`: A literal string.
  - `mak`: The highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
  - `mak2`: The highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
  - `i`: The value of `i`, which is 0.
  - `mak2`: The highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).

From the initial state, we know that `mak` and `mak2` are the same value, which is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists). Since the exact value of `mak` (and `mak2`) is not specified, we can only describe it as the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 0 [mak] (where [mak] is the highest i for which the input was < (or 0 if no such i exists))**
