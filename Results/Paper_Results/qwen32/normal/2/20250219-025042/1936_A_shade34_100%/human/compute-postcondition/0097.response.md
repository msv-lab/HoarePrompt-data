The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, or `mak`. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. Since none of the variables are modified by this operation, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, `pans` is an empty list, `mak` is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists**.
