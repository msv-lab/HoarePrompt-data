The given Python code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. It does not affect the values of any variables or alter the state of the program in terms of variable values.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `mak`, `pans`, `i`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak` is `n-1` if the input was `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least `n+1` elements, `i` is `n`**.
