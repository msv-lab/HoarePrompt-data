Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `t` is unchanged: This means `t` retains its previous value, but since it's not used in the print statement, we don't need to consider it further.
- `n` is greater than 0: This tells us that `n` is a positive integer.
- `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists): This means `mak2` holds the highest index where the input was `<`. If there was no such input, `mak2` is 0.
- `mak` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists): Similar to `mak2`, `mak` holds the highest index where the input was `<`. If there was no such input, `mak` is 0.
- `i` is 1: This indicates that `i` is currently set to 1.
- `s` is the new input string: This is the current input string, but it doesn't affect the values of `mak`, `mak2`, or `i` directly in this context.
- `pans` is determined based on the value of `s`: 
  - If `s` is `'<'`, then `pans` is `[0]`.
  - If `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, then `pans` is `[n - 1, 0]`.
  - Otherwise, `pans` is an empty list.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak` is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
- `mak2` is the same as `mak` (the highest `i` for which the input was `<` or 0 if no such `i` exists).
- `i` is 1.

### Determining the Output:

Given the above, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` as a literal string.
- `mak` which is the highest `i` for which the input was `<` (or 0 if no such `i` exists).
- `mak2` which is the same as `mak`.
- `i` which is 1.
- `mak2` again, which is the same as `mak`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 1 [mak] (where [mak] is the highest i for which the input was '<' or 0 if no such i exists)**
