The given code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not change the values of any variables; it simply flushes the output buffer to ensure that all output is written to the standard output stream. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `mak`, `s`, `pans`, or `i` are altered by this operation.

Given that `i` is mentioned to be incremented by 1 before the code snippet, we should reflect this increment in our output state.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `mak` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `s` is the input string, `pans` is unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**.
