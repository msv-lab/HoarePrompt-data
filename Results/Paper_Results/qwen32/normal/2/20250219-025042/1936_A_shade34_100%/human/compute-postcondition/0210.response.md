Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists). If the input was `'>'`, `mak` is `n`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0. `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least `n+1` elements. `i` is `n`.**
