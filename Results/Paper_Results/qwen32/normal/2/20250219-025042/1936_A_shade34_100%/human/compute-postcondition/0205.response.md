Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `mak2` is the highest `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such `i` exists), `mak` is `n-1` if the input was `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was either `'<'` or `'='` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `n-1`.**
