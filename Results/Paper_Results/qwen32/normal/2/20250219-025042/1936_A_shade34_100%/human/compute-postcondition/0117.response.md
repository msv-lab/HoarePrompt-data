Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `t` is unchanged, but it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this purpose.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `mak` is the current value of `i` if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `s` is the new input string.
- `pans` includes the current value of `i` if `s` is '=', but `pans` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this purpose.
- `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement is executed.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

We need to determine the values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` at the time of execution.

1. **Value of `mak2`:**
   - `mak2` is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - This value does not change after being set, so it remains the same until the next update.

2. **Value of `mak`:**
   - If `s` is '<', then `mak` is set to the current value of `i`.
   - If `s` is not '<', then `mak` is set to the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - Since we don't have the specific value of `s`, we can only say that `mak` is either the current value of `i` (if `s` is '<') or the largest `i` for which the input was '<'.

3. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement is executed.
   - Therefore, the value of `i` in the print statement is the value it had before the increment plus 1.

Putting this together, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` as a literal string.
- `mak`, which is either the current value of `i` (if `s` is '<') or the largest `i` for which the input was '<'.
- `mak2`, which is the largest `i` (1 <= `i` < `n`) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `i`, which is the current value of `i` before the increment plus 1.
- `mak2` again, which is the same as described above.

Thus, the output can be described as:
Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where [mak] is the current value of i if s is '<' or the largest i for which the input was '<', [mak2] is the largest i (1 <= i < n) for which the input was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, and [i] is the current value of i before the increment plus 1)**
