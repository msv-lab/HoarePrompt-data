The code snippet assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this assignment, `mak` will now hold the new value of `i`.

Given that `mak` was previously either 0 or `i` (depending on the input), and `i` has been incremented by 1, `mak` will now definitely be equal to the new value of `i`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` is unchanged, `mak` is equal to the new value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
