The code appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than `i + 1` and `s` is the string input by the user. After executing the code, the only change is that `pans` now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`; `s` is the string input by the user; `pans` includes the value of `i`.**
