### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the given solution step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We have `2n` integers on a whiteboard.
- We need to perform `n` moves where in each move, we pick two integers, add the smaller one to our score, and erase both.
- Our goal is to maximize the final score after `n` moves.

#### Strategy:
To maximize the score, we should aim to pair the smallest numbers together because adding the minimum of each pair to the score will yield the highest total when the smallest numbers are paired.

#### Solution Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of pairs) and the list of `2n` integers.
   
2. **Sorting:**
   - The list of integers is sorted in ascending order (`numbers.sort(reverse=False)`). This ensures that the smallest numbers come first.
   
3. **Pairing and Summing:**
   - The program then enters a loop where it repeatedly pops the first two elements from the sorted list, calculates their minimum, adds this minimum to the score, and continues until all elements are processed.
   - Since the list is sorted, the first two elements in each iteration will always be the smallest available numbers, ensuring that we are maximizing the sum of the minimums.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all pairs for a test case, the program prints the accumulated score.

#### Verification with Examples:
- **First Test Case:**
  - Input: `1`, `2 3`
  - Sorted List: `[2, 3]`
  - Pairs: `(2, 3)`
  - Score: `2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Input: `2`, `1 1 2 1`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
  - Pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`
  - Score: `1 + 1 = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Input: `3`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`
  - Score: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
  - Output: `3`

All these examples match the expected outputs, indicating that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always pairing the smallest available numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
