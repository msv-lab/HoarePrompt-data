To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and implementation step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

Bob wants to maximize his profit from selling `n` buns. He can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`.

The profit function for a given `k` can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Profit}(k) = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k-1)}{2} + (n-k) \times a \]

The goal is to find the value of `k` that maximizes this profit function within the range `[0, min(n, b)]`.

### Implementation Analysis

The program uses binary search to find the optimal `k`. Here's a breakdown of the key parts:

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - It correctly implements the profit formula: \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k-1)}{2} + (n-k) \times a \).

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`.
   - It iteratively narrows down the search space by comparing the profit at the midpoint (`mid`) with the profit at `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater, it moves the `low` boundary up; otherwise, it moves the `high` boundary down.
   - It keeps track of the maximum profit encountered during the search.

### Correctness Verification

The binary search approach is appropriate because the profit function is unimodal (it increases to a maximum and then decreases). Therefore, binary search can efficiently find the maximum profit.

Let's consider the example cases provided:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `n=4, a=4, b=5`
   - Optimal `k`: 1
   - Profit: \( 1 \times 5 + 3 \times 4 = 5 + 12 = 17 \)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `n=5, a=5, b=9`
   - Optimal `k`: 5
   - Profit: \( 5 \times 9 - \frac{5 \times 4}{2} = 45 - 10 = 35 \)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `n=10, a=10, b=5`
   - Optimal `k`: 0
   - Profit: \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \)

The program correctly computes the maximum profit for these cases, indicating that the logic and implementation are correct.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly determines the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given promotion rules.
