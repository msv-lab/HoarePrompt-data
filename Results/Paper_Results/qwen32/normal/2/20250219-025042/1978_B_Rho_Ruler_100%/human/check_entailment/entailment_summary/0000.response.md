### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that the logic implemented in the functions `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem description and correctly computes the maximum profit Bob can achieve.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To calculate the profit for a given `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- **Formula**: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`
  - This formula correctly computes the profit based on the problem statement:
    - The first `k` buns are sold at prices decreasing from `b` to `(b - k + 1)`. The sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `(b - k + 1)` is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
    - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the profit.
- **Output Hints**: The function returns the calculated profit for a specific `k`, which matches the expected behavior.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To find the maximum profit over all possible values of `k` (from 0 to `min(n, b)`).
- **Binary Search Approach**: The function uses binary search to efficiently find the `k` that maximizes the profit.
  - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`.
  - For each midpoint `mid` in the binary search, it calculates the profit for `mid` and `mid + 1` using `func_1`.
  - It updates `max_profit` with the higher of the two profits.
  - It adjusts the search range (`low` and `high`) based on whether the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than that for `mid`.
- **Output Hints**: The function returns the maximum profit found, which aligns with the problem's requirement to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

### Conclusion:
Both functions work together to solve the problem correctly. `func_1` calculates the profit for a specific `k`, and `func_2` finds the optimal `k` that maximizes this profit using a binary search approach. The logic and implementation match the problem description accurately.

**Correctness: True**
