The code snippet updates the value of `high` to `mid - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given:
- `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`
- `high` was initially `min(n, b)`

After the execution of `high = mid - 1`, the new value of `high` is `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, `high` is `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`, `max_profit` is `max(0, profit_mid)`, `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, and `profit_next` is not greater than `profit_mid`.**
