To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `low <= high`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns.
- `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun.
- `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
- `max_profit` is `max(0, profit_mid)`.
- `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`.
- `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.
- `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
- If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is set to `mid + 1` and `high` remains `min(n, b)`. Otherwise, `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`.

The loop condition is `low <= high`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Let's analyze the possible adjustments:

1. **If `profit_next > profit_mid`:**
   - `low` is set to `mid + 1`.
   - `high` remains `min(n, b)`.

2. **If `profit_next <= profit_mid`:**
   - `low` is set to 0.
   - `high` is set to `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`.

In both cases, the loop can continue as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Therefore, no additional adjustments are necessary beyond ensuring that the values of `low` and `high` are set according to the logic described above.

Since the problem asks us to adjust the state such that the loop can certainly execute one more time, we should ensure that `low` is set to a value that is less than or equal to `high` after the adjustments.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `max_profit` is `max(0, profit_mid)`, `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `low` is set according to the condition (`mid + 1` if `profit_next > profit_mid` else `0`), `high` is set according to the condition (`min(n, b)` if `profit_next > profit_mid` else `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`)**

This ensures that `low <= high` and the loop can execute one more time.
