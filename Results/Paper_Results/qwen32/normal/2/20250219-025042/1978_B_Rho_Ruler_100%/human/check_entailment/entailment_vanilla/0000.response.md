### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly finds the maximum profit Bob can achieve by choosing an optimal value of \( k \).

#### Explanation of the Program:

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the total profit if Bob sells the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price.
   - The profit from the first \( k \) buns is calculated as \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \). This formula accounts for the decreasing price of each subsequent bun.
   - The profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns is simply \( (n - k) \times a \).

2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - The search range for \( k \) is between 0 and \( \min(n, b) \) because selling more than \( b \) buns at the modified price would not make sense (as the price would become negative).
   - The binary search iteratively narrows down the range by comparing the profit at the midpoint (`mid`) with the profit at the next point (`mid + 1`).
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, it means the maximum profit lies to the right of `mid`, so the search continues in the higher half.
   - Otherwise, the search continues in the lower half.
   - The maximum profit found during the search is returned.

#### Verification:

- The binary search approach ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found efficiently, even for large values of \( n \) and \( b \).
- The calculation of profit in `func_1` correctly reflects the problem's conditions.
- The program handles edge cases, such as when \( k = 0 \) (all buns sold at the usual price) and when \( k = \min(n, b) \) (all buns sold at the modified price).

Given these points, the program appears to be correctly implemented and should produce the expected results for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
