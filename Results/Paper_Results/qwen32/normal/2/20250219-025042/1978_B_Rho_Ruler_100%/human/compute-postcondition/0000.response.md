Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, `high` is `min(n, b)`**.

This means that `low` has been set to 0 and `high` has been set to the minimum value between `n` (the number of buns) and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
