The `print('NO')` statement in the provided Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `s`, `n`, or `a` described in the initial state. The statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides details about several variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `a`), but none of these variables are used within the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
