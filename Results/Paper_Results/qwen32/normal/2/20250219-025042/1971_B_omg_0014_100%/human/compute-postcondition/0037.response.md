Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set of unique characters from the new `s`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the length of `a` is 1, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `b` is the sorted version of `s`, and `c` is the sorted version of `s` in descending order.**
