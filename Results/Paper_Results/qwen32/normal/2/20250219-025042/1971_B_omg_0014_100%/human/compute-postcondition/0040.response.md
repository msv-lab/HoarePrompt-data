Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads a string `s`. It checks if all characters in the string are the same. If they are, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed from `s` if `s` is not already sorted; otherwise, it prints the lexicographically largest string.**
