The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `s`, `n`, `a`, and `i` described in the initial state. The initial state provides details about these variables but none of them affect the execution of this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the code is:

Output: **YES**
