Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set of unique characters from `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, then no additional changes are made. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `b` is the string `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is the string `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is equal to `b`, then `s` is already sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set of unique characters from the new `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, no additional changes are made. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `b` is the new `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is the new `s` sorted in descending order. If `s` is equal to `b`, then `s` is already sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, `s` is sorted in descending order and stored in `c`. Additionally, if `s` is not equal to `b`, `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new input string, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set of unique characters from the new `s`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the length of `a` is 1, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `b` is the sorted version of `s`, and `c` is the sorted version of `s` in descending order.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
