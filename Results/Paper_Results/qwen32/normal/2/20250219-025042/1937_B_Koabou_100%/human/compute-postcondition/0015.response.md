Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value; `s` is an empty list; `x` is 0; `y` is `i` if `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1', otherwise `y` remains 0.**
