The value of `y` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` was incremented by 1 before this assignment, `y` now holds the value of `i` after the increment. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value, `i` is incremented by 1, `y` is equal to the new value of `i`**.
