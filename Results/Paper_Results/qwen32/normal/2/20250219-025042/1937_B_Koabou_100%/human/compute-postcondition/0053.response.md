Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (representing the length of two binary strings) and two binary strings of length `n` (representing the top and bottom rows of a 2 Ã— n grid). For each test case, the function returns a result indicating whether it's possible to traverse from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid following specific rules (which are not detailed here but implied by the context).**
