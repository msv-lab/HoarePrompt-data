The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as a counter for the loop iterations. The loop is set to run exactly 2 times, as indicated by `range(2)`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, meaning the loop has already executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented to 2.

The other variables `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted according to the given instructions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being `n` and the second being the new input value; `_` is 2**
