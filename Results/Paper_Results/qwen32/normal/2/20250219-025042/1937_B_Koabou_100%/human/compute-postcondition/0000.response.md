The provided code snippet only initializes an empty list `a`. No other variables are modified, and no operations are performed that would affect the input or any other variables.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by two binary strings of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the 2 × n grid respectively. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is an empty list.**
