To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `y`, and `x`. The loop condition is `for i in range(y, x)`, meaning `i` will take values starting from `y` up to, but not including, `x`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`
- `x` is `i` if the loop breaks at iteration `i` due to `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, otherwise `x` is `n - 1`
- `y` is the last index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was true, or 0 if never met, and `y` must be less than `x`
- If `a[1][i:x]` equals `s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then `t` is `x - i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Since the loop iterates over `i` from `y` to `x - 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's assume `i` at the end of the previous iteration is some value `k` (where `y <= k < x`). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

No other variables (`y` and `x`) need to be adjusted because they define the range of the loop and are not modified within the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Given that `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `k`, the state becomes:
State: **`s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `i` is `k + 1`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we express it as `i + 1`:

State: **`s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**

This is the adjusted state for the start of the next iteration of the loop.
