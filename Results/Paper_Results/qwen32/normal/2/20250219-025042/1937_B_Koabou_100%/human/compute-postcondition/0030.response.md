Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[0][i + 1] == '0'` and `a[1][i] == '1'`, then `y` is equal to the new value of `i`.**
