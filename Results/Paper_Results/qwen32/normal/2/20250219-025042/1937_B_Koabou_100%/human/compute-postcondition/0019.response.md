Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first input value and the second being the second input value; `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`; `x` is `i`; `y` is `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is nested within.
