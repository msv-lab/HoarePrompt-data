The code snippet assigns the value of `x` to `L`. No other variables are modified by this assignment.

Given that `x` is defined as `(L + 50002) // 2`, the new value of `L` will be `(L + 50002) // 2`.

Since `L` is now being set to `x`, and `x` was calculated based on the old value of `L`, the new value of `L` will be the same as `x`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` in the graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `x` is `(L + 50002) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is `n-2`; `R` is 50002; `numCuts` is 0; `L` is `(L + 50002) // 2`.**
