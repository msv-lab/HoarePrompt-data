The code snippet appends the value `a` to the list located at index `b` in the `adj` list. This means that the adjacency list `adj` is modified such that the list at index `b` now includes `a` as one of its elements.

Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged. The only change is in the `adj` list.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` and the list at index `b` contains `a`; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input; `L` is the final integer value that satisfies the condition; `R` is `L + 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the last calculated midpoint; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is 0.**
