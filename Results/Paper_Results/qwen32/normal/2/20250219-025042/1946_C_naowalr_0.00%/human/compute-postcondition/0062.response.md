The code snippet assigns a specific integer value to the variable `R`. The value assigned is `100001` (which is `int(100000.0 + 1)`). No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` in the graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is the last calculated midpoint; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)` in the final iteration; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is `n-2`.**
