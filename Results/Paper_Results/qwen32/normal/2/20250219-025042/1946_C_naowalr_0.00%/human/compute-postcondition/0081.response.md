The value of `x` is recalculated using the formula `(L + R) // 2`. Given that `L` is less than 50001 and `R` is 50002, the new value of `x` will be `(L + 50002) // 2`. This is the same formula used to initially set `x` in the initial state, so the value of `x` remains unchanged.

All other variables retain their original values and conditions as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` in the graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `x` is `(L + 50002) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is `n-2`; `R` is 50002; `L` is less than 50001; `numCuts` is 0**.
