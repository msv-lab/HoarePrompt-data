The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, `i` should now be `n - 1`.

Since no other variables in the loop head (`n`) are being modified within the loop, we don't need to adjust them.

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` includes `b` and the list at index `b` includes `a`; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is 50000; `R` is 50001; `x` is 50000; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is `n - 1`; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input.**
