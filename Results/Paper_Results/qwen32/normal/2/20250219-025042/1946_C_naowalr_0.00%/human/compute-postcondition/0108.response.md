To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `R - L > 1`.

Given the current state:
- `R` is 100001
- `L` is 1

Let's evaluate the condition `R - L > 1`:

- Current `R - L` = 100001 - 1 = 100000

Since 100000 is indeed greater than 1, the condition `R - L > 1` is satisfied, and the loop can execute.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `R` and `L` for the loop to execute the first time. The other variables (`adj`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `x`, `leftover`, `z`, `i`, `numCuts`) are not part of the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` as per the input; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `x` is 50000; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is `-1`; `numCuts` is 0**
