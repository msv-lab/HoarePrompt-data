The given code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only changes are the introduction of the new variables `a` and `b` which are assigned the values read from the input.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from input, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `L` is 50000, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50000, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `z` is `z + 1`, `i` is `n-2`, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input.**
