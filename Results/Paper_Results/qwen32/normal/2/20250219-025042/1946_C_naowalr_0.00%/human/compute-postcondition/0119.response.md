The given Python code snippet sets `numCuts` to 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the value of `numCuts`.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` as per the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is 100001; `x` is either 50001 or 75001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is -1; `numCuts` is 0.**
