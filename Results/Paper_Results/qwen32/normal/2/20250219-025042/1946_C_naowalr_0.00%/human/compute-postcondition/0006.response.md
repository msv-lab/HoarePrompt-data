The code appends the value of `b` to the sublist at index `a` in the list `adj`. Given that `adj` is initially a list of three empty lists, and `a` and `b` are integers read from input, the sublist at index `a` will now contain `b`.

Output State: **`adj` is a list where `adj[a]` contains `[b]`, `n` is 2, `k` is 1, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the first integer read from input, `b` is the second integer read from input.**
