The given code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input, while the other variables (`adj`, `t`) remain unchanged.

Since the problem specifies that `n` is the number of vertices in the tree and `k` is the number of edges to be removed, and these values are being reassigned from the input, we need to reflect this in our output state.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, where each inner list contains the vertices adjacent to the vertex corresponding to its index; `n` is the first integer read from the standard input; `k` is the second integer read from the standard input such that 1 <= `k` < `n`; `t` is an integer read from the standard input and must be greater than 0.**
