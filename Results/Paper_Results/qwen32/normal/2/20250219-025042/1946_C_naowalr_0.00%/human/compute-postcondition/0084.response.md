The code snippet assigns the value of `x` to `L`. Given that `x` is calculated as `(L + 50002) // 2`, after this assignment, `L` will take on the value of `x`.

Since `x` is defined as `(L + 50002) // 2`, the new value of `L` will be `(L + 50002) // 2`. This means `L` is updated to be half of its original value plus 25001 (since integer division by 2 of 50002 is 25001).

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` in the graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `x` is `(L + 50002) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is incremented by 1; `i` is `n-2`; `R` is 50002; `L` is `(L + 50002) // 2`; `numCuts` is 0**.
