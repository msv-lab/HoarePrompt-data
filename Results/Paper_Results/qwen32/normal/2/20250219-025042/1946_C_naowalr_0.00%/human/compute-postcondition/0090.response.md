The provided code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This means that the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input, while other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only variables affected by the code are `n` and `k`. The other variables (`adj`, `t`, `L`, `R`, `x`, `leftover`, `z`, `i`) retain their original values.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` in the graph; `n` is the first integer read from input; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is 50000; `R` is 50001; `x` is 50000; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is `n-2`.**
