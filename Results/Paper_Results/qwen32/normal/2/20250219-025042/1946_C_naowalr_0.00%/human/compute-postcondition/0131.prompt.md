Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` as per the input; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `x` is 50000; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is `-1`; `numCuts` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` as per the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is 100001; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is -1; `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, or `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` as per the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is either 50001 or 100001; `x` is either 50001 or 75001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is -1; `numCuts` is 0. Regardless of whether `numCuts > k` or `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` as per the input; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is either 50001 or 100001; `x` is `(L + R) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is -1; `numCuts` is 0. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `R` is set to `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `L` is set to `(L + R) // 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
