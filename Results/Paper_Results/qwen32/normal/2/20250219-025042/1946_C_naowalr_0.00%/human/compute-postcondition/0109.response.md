The code snippet updates the value of `x` to be the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. Given the initial values of `L` as 1 and `R` as 100001, the new value of `x` will be `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which equals 50001.

All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` includes all nodes `b` that are directly connected to `a` as per the input; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `t` is an integer greater than 0; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; `z` is `z + 1`; `i` is -1; `numCuts` is 0**
