The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `palka`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input.**
