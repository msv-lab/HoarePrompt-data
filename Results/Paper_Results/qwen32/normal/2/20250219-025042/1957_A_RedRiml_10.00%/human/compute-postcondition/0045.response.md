The code snippet provided resets the dictionary `d` to an empty dictionary. This means that all the key-value pairs that were previously in `d` are removed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the new input; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times.**
