The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `pl`. No other variables are modified. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, and `palka` retain their values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl` is an empty list.**
