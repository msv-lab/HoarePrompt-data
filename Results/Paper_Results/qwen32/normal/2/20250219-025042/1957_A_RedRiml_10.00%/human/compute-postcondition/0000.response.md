The code snippet `w = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `w`. This means the value of `w` will be whatever integer is provided as input.

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and for each test case, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers between 1 and 100. None of these variables are affected by the code snippet provided.

Therefore, the output state will include the new value of `w` and retain the conditions for `t`, `n`, and the `a_i` values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer.**
