The given code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. This means that the dictionary `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the new input and must contain at least one element; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is a dictionary containing the key `i` with the value `1`; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the old `palka` that appear at least 3 times.**
