The given code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. This means that if `i` was not already a key in `d`, it will now be added with the value `1`. If `i` was already a key in `d`, its value will be overwritten to `1`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `d` because the code modifies this dictionary. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is a list that may contain the element `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is 1; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.**
