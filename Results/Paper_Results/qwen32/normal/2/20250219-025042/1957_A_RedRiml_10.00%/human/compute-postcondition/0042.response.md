The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `ln`. This means `ln` will take on whatever integer value is provided by the user input. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `w` is 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `palka` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`; `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times.**
