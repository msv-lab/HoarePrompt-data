The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, which iterates over each character in the `password` string. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `char` and how it relates to the `password` string.

Given:
- `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters (where `n ≥ 1`).
- `char` is the next character in the `password` string.
- If `char` is a digit, `digits` contains its original elements plus `char` at the end.
- Otherwise, `letters` is a list that now includes the character `char` appended to it.

At the end of the previous iteration, `char` was processed, and now we need to move to the next character in the `password` string.

Step-by-step adjustment:
1. The current `char` has already been processed, so we need to move to the next character in the `password` string.
2. Since the loop iterates over each character in `password`, the next `char` will be the subsequent character in the string.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next character in the `password` string.

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters (where `n ≥ 1`), `char` is the next character in the `password` string after the previously processed `char`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` contains its original elements plus `char` at the end. Otherwise, `letters` is a list that now includes the character `char` appended to it.**

To be more specific, if `char` was the `k`-th character in the `password` string during the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `char` will be the `(k+1)`-th character in the `password` string.

Since we don't have the exact value of `k`, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters (where `n ≥ 1`), `char` is the next character in the `password` string. If `char` is a digit, `digits` contains its original elements plus `char` at the end. Otherwise, `letters` is a list that now includes the character `char` appended to it.**

However, to be more precise about the transition, we can say:

State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters (where `n ≥ 1`), `char` is the next character in the `password` string following the previously processed `char`.**
