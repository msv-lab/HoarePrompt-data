Output State: **password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; digits is a list containing all the digits from the password in the order they appear; letters is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in the order they appear.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `digits` will contain all the numeric characters from the `password` string in the order they appeared, and `letters` will contain all the lowercase alphabetic characters from the `password` string in the order they appeared. The `password` string remains unchanged.
