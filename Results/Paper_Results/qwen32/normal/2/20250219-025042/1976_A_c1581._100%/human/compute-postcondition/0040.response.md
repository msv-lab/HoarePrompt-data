Postcondition: **The loop completes all iterations without returning False, indicating that the `digits` list is sorted in ascending order and the largest digit is less than or equal to any letter in the `letters` list; `sortedPassword` is a string formed by concatenating the elements of `digits` followed by the elements of `letters`. Additionally, `sortedPassword` is not equal to `password`.**
