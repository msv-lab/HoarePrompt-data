Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the password in ascending order and must have at least one digit; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in alphabetical order. Additionally, either `i` is not less than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is not greater than `digits[i + 1]`. Either `i` is greater than or equal to `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is less than or equal to `letters[i]`.**
