Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `password`, which is a string consisting of exactly n characters (where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and 1 ≤ n ≤ 20). The function returns `True` if the password meets a specific condition (which is not detailed here but is met in Case_7); otherwise, it returns `False` in all other cases.**
