The code snippet sorts the `digits` list. This means that the order of the digits in the `digits` list will be rearranged in ascending order. The `password` string and the `letters` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the password in ascending order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the password in the order they appear.**
