The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing the single element `a`, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is 1, `a` is the second integer from the input.**
