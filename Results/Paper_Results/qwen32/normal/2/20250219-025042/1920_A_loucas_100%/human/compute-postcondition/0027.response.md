The code snippet `big.append(a)` modifies the list `big` by adding the integer `a` to it. Given the initial state, `big` could either be an empty list or a list containing the single element `a` (if `x` was initially 1). After executing the code, `big` will definitely contain the integer `a` as its last element.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is 2, `big` is a list containing the elements from its initial state plus `a`, `no` is a list containing `[a]` if `x` is not 1 and not 2, otherwise `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` and `a` are the two integers read from the input, `iterable2` is 2.**

In simpler terms, `big` now includes `a` as one of its elements, while all other variables retain their initial values.
