The value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. Given that `t2` is divisible by 15, `t2 // 15` will be an integer. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0. If `b` is even, then `t` was initially set to `b // 2`; otherwise, `t` was set to `b // 2 + 1`. `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`. `t2` is `a - t1` and `t2` is divisible by 15.**
