Postcondition: **`t` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `i` is an integer, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If `t` was even before the if-else block, `t` is updated to `(previous t) // 2`. If `t` was odd before the if-else block, `t` is updated to `t // 2 + 1`. `i` is incremented by 1. `b` remains unchanged. `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
