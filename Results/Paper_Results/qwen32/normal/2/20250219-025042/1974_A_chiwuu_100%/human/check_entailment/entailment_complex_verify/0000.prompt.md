You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: - After all `n` iterations, the final value of `t` will be printed for each test case.
    #
    #### Example Calculation:
    #
    #Let's assume the following inputs for a single test case:
    #- `t` (initial) = 5 (from the problem statement, `t` is the number of test cases, but here we consider one test case with `x=5` and `y=3`)
    #- `n` = 3 (number of iterations)
    #- Inputs for each iteration:
    #  - Iteration 1: `a = 10`, `b = 6`
    #  - Iteration 2: `a = 20`, `b = 8`
    #  - Iteration 3: `a = 30`, `b = 10`
    #
    ##### Iteration 1:
    #- `a = 10`, `b = 6`
    #- `t = b // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3` (since `b` is even)
    #- `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4 = 3 * 15 - 6 * 4 = 45 - 24 = 21`
    #- Since `t1 >= a` (21 >= 10), `t` remains 3.
    #
    ##### Iteration 2:
    #- `a = 20`, `b = 8`
    #- `t = b // 2 = 8 // 2 = 4` (since `b` is even)
    #- `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4 = 4 * 15 - 8 * 4 = 60 - 32 = 28`
    #- Since `t1 >= a` (28 >= 20), `t` remains 4.
    #
    ##### Iteration 3:
    #- `a = 30`, `b = 10`
    #- `t = b // 2 = 10 // 2 = 5` (since `b` is even)
    #- `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4 = 5 * 15 - 10 * 4 = 75 - 40 = 35`
    #- Since `t1 >= a` (35 >= 30), `t` remains 5.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #After all iterations, the final value of `t` is 5 for this test case.
    #
    #### Generalized Output State:
    #For any given test case with initial `t` (which is the number of test cases), and `n` iterations, the final value of `t` after all iterations will depend on the specific values of `a` and `b` provided in each iteration. However, the process described above will always yield the final value of `t` after all iterations.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #The final output state after all iterations of the loop is determined by the iterative updates of `t` based on the conditions provided in the loop body. The exact value of `t` will vary depending on the inputs, but the process remains consistent.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates a value `t` based on `b` and adjusts `t` if necessary to ensure that `t * 15 - b * 4` is at least `a`. Finally, it prints the calculated value of `t` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons.
- Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows x 3 columns).
- A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- A 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
- Each cell can be occupied by only one icon.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of screens required based on the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

Here's the program again for reference:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - `t` is initialized to `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons (because 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells and a screen has 15 cells), the calculation `t = b // 2 + (b % 2)` is used. This is equivalent to `t = (b + 1) // 2`.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space:**
   - `t1` is calculated as the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. This is done by subtracting the total cells occupied by 2x2 icons from the total cells available in `t` screens.
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.

4. **Calculating Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `t1` (remaining space) is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates how many additional screens are needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons. This is done by dividing the remaining 1x1 icons by 15 (the number of cells per screen) and rounding up.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with some cases to ensure it works correctly.

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Explanation: One 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells. One 1x1 icon fits in the remaining space.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `7 2`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Explanation: Two 2x2 icons occupy 8 cells, leaving 7 cells. Seven 1x1 icons fit in the remaining space.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `12 4`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: Four 2x2 icons occupy 16 cells, which requires 2 screens (15 cells each). Six 1x1 icons fit in the remaining space of the second screen.

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `0 3`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: Three 2x2 icons require 2 screens (15 cells each).

#### Test Case 5:
- Input: `0 0`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Explanation: No icons, no screens needed.

#### Test Case 6:
- Input: `0 9`
- Expected Output: `5`
- Explanation: Nine 2x2 icons require 5 screens (15 cells each).

### Conclusion:
After testing multiple cases, the program seems to handle the described scenarios correctly. It calculates the minimum number of screens required for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons efficiently.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for any combination of 1x1 and 2x2 icons within the given constraints. It handles edge cases such as zero icons and maximizes the use of space on each screen.
