Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `b // 2`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `t` is even**

Natural Language: The value of `t` is now half of its original value (integer division), which means `t` is equal to `b // 2`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, and `n`) remain unchanged. The condition that `t` is even still holds because `t` was originally even, and dividing an even number by 2 results in another even number.
