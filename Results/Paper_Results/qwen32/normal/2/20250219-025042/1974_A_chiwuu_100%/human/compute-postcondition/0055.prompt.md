Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b
    if t % 2 == 0:
        t = t // 2
    else:
        t = t // 2 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `n` is greater than 0. If `b` is even, `t` is initially set to `b // 2`; otherwise, `t` is initially set to `b // 2 + 1`. `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made to `t`. If `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer updated based on its previous value and the condition `t1 >= a`. If `t1 >= a`, `t` is updated to `(previous t) // 2` if it was even, or `t // 2 + 1` if it was odd. If `t1 < a`, `t` is incremented by `(a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15` if `(a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) % 15 == 0`, or by `(a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1` otherwise. `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` retain their respective values, with `i` being incremented by 1 and `n` remaining greater than `i + 1`. `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an integer; `b` is the integer value provided by the user input; `t` is updated based on the condition `t1 >= a`. If `t1 >= a`, then `a`, `b`, and `t1` are recalculated; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If `t1 < a`, then `t` is updated based on whether `t2 % 15 == 0` or not, where if true, `t` is incremented by `(a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`, and if false, `t` is incremented by `(a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1`; `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is recalculated as `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
