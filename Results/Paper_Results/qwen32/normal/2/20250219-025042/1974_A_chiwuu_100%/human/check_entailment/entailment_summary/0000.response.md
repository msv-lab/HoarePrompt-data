### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program to see if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to fit the given icons.

1. **Initial Calculation of `t`:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b`, which represents the number of 2x2 icons.
   - If `t` (number of 2x2 icons) is even, `t` is divided by 2 because each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and two such icons can fit into 8 cells, effectively taking up 2 "units" of space.
   - If `t` is odd, `t` is divided by 2 and rounded up because an odd number of 2x2 icons will require an extra unit of space.

2. **Adjusting `t` Based on Remaining Space:**
   - The remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
     - `t * 15` represents the total capacity of `t` screens (since each screen has 15 cells).
     - `b * 4` subtracts the space occupied by the 2x2 icons.
   - If the remaining space (`t1`) is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), no additional screens are needed beyond `t`.
   - Otherwise, the number of additional screens required to fit the remaining 1x1 icons is calculated:
     - `t2 = a - t1` represents the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed.
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, exactly `t2 // 15` additional screens are needed.
     - If `t2` is not divisible by 15, one more screen is needed to accommodate the remaining icons (`t2 // 15 + 1`).

3. **Printing the Result:**
   - The final value of `t` (which includes both the screens needed for 2x2 icons and any additional screens needed for 1x1 icons) is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The logic seems correct in terms of calculating the minimum number of screens required.
- The program accounts for both the space occupied by 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons.
- The rounding up logic for odd numbers of 2x2 icons ensures that all icons can be placed without exceeding the grid capacity.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed to fit the given icons based on the provided problem description and examples.

**Correctness: True**
