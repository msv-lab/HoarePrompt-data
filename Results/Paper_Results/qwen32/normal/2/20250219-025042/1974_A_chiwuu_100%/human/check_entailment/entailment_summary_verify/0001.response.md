Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and function summary to ensure its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining the minimum number of 5x3 grids (screens) needed to accommodate `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons.

- A 5x3 grid has 15 cells.
- A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- A 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   for i in range(n):
       (a, b) = input().split()
       a = int(a)
       b = int(b)
   ```
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (`a`) and 2x2 icons (`b`).

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   ```python
   t = b
   if t % 2 == 0:
       t = t // 2
   else:
       t = t // 2 + 1
   ```
   - This part calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit at most 3 (5x3 / 4 rounded down) 2x2 icons, we need to round up the number of screens. This is done by dividing `b` by 2 and rounding up.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space:**
   ```python
   t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
   ```
   - This calculates the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons. `t * 15` gives the total number of cells in `t` screens, and `b * 4` subtracts the cells occupied by 2x2 icons.

4. **Checking if Remaining Space is Enough for 1x1 Icons:**
   ```python
   if t1 >= a:
       t = t
   else:
       t2 = a - t1
       if t2 % 15 == 0:
           t = t + t2 // 15
       else:
           t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
   ```
   - If the remaining space (`t1`) is enough to accommodate all 1x1 icons (`a`), no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, calculate how many more screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`t2`). This is done by dividing `t2` by 15 and rounding up.

5. **Output:**
   ```python
   print(t)
   ```
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Testing the Program

Let's verify the program with the sample input provided in the problem statement.
