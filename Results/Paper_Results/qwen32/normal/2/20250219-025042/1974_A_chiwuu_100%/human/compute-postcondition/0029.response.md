The given code snippet updates the value of `t` by setting it to `t // 2 + 1`. This operation affects only the variable `t`, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is initially `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer.
- `i` is an integer.
- `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
- `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
- `b` remains an integer.

After executing the line `t = t // 2 + 1`, the new value of `t` is calculated as `t // 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is `t // 2 + 1`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `i` is an integer incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
