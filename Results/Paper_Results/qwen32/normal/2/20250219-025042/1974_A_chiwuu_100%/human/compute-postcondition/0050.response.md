To determine the new state after executing the given code, we'll analyze the changes step-by-step.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is the integer value provided by the user input.
- `t` is calculated based on the user input: if the input is even, `t` is the input divided by 2 (integer division); if the input is odd, `t` is the input divided by 2 plus 1.
- `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

The code snippet modifies `t`:
```
t = t + t2 // 15
```

Let's break down the changes:
- `t2 // 15` is the integer division of `t2` by 15.
- `t` is updated to its current value plus the result of `t2 // 15`.

Thus, the new value of `t` is `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`.

Other variables (`a`, `b`, `t1`, `t2`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged except for `t`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer; `b` is the integer value provided by the user input; `t` is `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
