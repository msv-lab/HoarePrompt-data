Postcondition: **`a` is an integer; `b` is the integer value provided by the user input; `t` is the integer value provided by the user input divided by 2 (integer division) if `t` is even, otherwise `t` is the integer value provided by the user input divided by 2 plus 1; `t1` is updated based on the condition `t1 >= a`; `a`, `b`, and `t1` are recalculated; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
