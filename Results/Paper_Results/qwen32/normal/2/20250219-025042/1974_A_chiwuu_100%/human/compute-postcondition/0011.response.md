`t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. Given the initial conditions, `t` is determined based on whether `b` is even or odd. If `b` is even, `t` is `b // 2`; otherwise, `t` is `b // 2 + 1`.

The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged. The new value of `t1` is derived from the expression provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `n` is greater than 0. If `b` is even, then `t` is set to `b // 2`. Otherwise, `t` is set to `b // 2 + 1`. `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
