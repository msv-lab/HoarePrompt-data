Output State: **`t` is an integer (updated based on its previous parity) + (`a - (t * 15 - b * 4)` // 15); `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `i` is an integer incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to its previous value plus the integer division of `t2` by 15. All other variables remain unchanged.
