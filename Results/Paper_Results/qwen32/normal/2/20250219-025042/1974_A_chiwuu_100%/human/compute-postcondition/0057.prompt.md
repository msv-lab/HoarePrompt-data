You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b
        
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:

    #State: - After all `n` iterations, the final value of `t` will be printed for each test case.
    #
    #### Example Calculation:
    #
    #Let's assume the following inputs for a single test case:
    #- `t` (initial) = 5 (from the problem statement, `t` is the number of test cases, but here we consider one test case with `x=5` and `y=3`)
    #- `n` = 3 (number of iterations)
    #- Inputs for each iteration:
    #  - Iteration 1: `a = 10`, `b = 6`
    #  - Iteration 2: `a = 20`, `b = 8`
    #  - Iteration 3: `a = 30`, `b = 10`
    #
    ##### Iteration 1:
    #- `a = 10`, `b = 6`
    #- `t = b // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3` (since `b` is even)
    #- `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4 = 3 * 15 - 6 * 4 = 45 - 24 = 21`
    #- Since `t1 >= a` (21 >= 10), `t` remains 3.
    #
    ##### Iteration 2:
    #- `a = 20`, `b = 8`
    #- `t = b // 2 = 8 // 2 = 4` (since `b` is even)
    #- `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4 = 4 * 15 - 8 * 4 = 60 - 32 = 28`
    #- Since `t1 >= a` (28 >= 20), `t` remains 4.
    #
    ##### Iteration 3:
    #- `a = 30`, `b = 10`
    #- `t = b // 2 = 10 // 2 = 5` (since `b` is even)
    #- `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4 = 5 * 15 - 10 * 4 = 75 - 40 = 35`
    #- Since `t1 >= a` (35 >= 30), `t` remains 5.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #After all iterations, the final value of `t` is 5 for this test case.
    #
    #### Generalized Output State:
    #For any given test case with initial `t` (which is the number of test cases), and `n` iterations, the final value of `t` after all iterations will depend on the specific values of `a` and `b` provided in each iteration. However, the process described above will always yield the final value of `t` after all iterations.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #The final output state after all iterations of the loop is determined by the iterative updates of `t` based on the conditions provided in the loop body. The exact value of `t` will vary depending on the inputs, but the process remains consistent.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. The function processes each test case and returns the sum of `x` and `y` for that test case.
