Postcondition: **`t` is an integer updated based on the previous parity and the result of `(a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is incremented by the result of `(a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is incremented by the result of `(a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15` plus 1. `a`, `b`, `i`, `n`, `t1`, and `t2` retain their respective values as defined in the precondition, with `i` being incremented by 1 and `n` remaining greater than `i + 1`.**
