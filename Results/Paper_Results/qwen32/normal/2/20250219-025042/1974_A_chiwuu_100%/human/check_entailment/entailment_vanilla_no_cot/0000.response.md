To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to fit the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on a 5x3 grid.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (`a`) and the number of 2x2 icons (`b`). It then calculates the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate these icons.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the program:

1. **Calculate Initial Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - `t = b` (initially set to the number of 2x2 icons)
   - If `t` (number of 2x2 icons) is even, divide by 2 to get the number of screens needed (`t = t // 2`)
   - If `t` is odd, add 1 after dividing by 2 (`t = t // 2 + 1`)

2. **Calculate Remaining Space:**
   - Calculate the total available space on `t` screens: `t * 15`
   - Subtract the space occupied by 2x2 icons: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`

3. **Check if Remaining Space is Sufficient:**
   - If `t1` (remaining space) is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `t2 = a - t1` (remaining 1x1 icons)
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, add `t2 // 15` to `t`.
     - Otherwise, add `t2 // 15 + 1` to `t`.

### Issues in the Program

The logic for calculating the initial number of screens for 2x2 icons is incorrect. The program simply divides the number of 2x2 icons by 2 and rounds up, which does not account for the actual placement constraints on the 5x3 grid.

#### Example Issue:
- For `b = 3` (3 2x2 icons), the program calculates `t = 2` (since 3 // 2 + 1 = 2). However, it's impossible to place 3 2x2 icons on 2 screens because each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells, and 2 screens provide only 30 cells, but placing 3 2x2 icons would require 12 cells, leaving 18 cells, but the arrangement might not fit due to the grid constraints.

### Correct Approach

A correct approach involves:
1. Placing 2x2 icons first, considering the grid constraints.
2. Calculating the remaining space and fitting 1x1 icons accordingly.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the provided program, the logic for determining the minimum number of screens is flawed.
