`t2` is assigned the value of `a - t1`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged. Since `t1` is defined as `t * 15 - b * 4` and it is given that `t1` is less than `a`, the new value of `t2` will be a positive number.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `n` is greater than 0. If `b` is even, then `t` is set to `b // 2`. Otherwise, `t` is set to `b // 2 + 1`. `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`. `t2` is `a - t1`.**
