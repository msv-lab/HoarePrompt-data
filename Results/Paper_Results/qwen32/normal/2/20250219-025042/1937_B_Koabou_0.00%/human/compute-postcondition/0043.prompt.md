Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, `a` is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`, `x` is n - 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
        t = x - i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `n - i` if the substring of `a[0]` from the start to index `i + 1` is equal to the substring of `s` from the start to index `i + 1`. `n` remains an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, `a` is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`, and `x` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0. If the substrings are not equal, the control does not change as there is no else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `n - i - 1` if `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]`, otherwise `t` remains `n - (i + 1)`. `i` is `i + 1` in both cases, and `x` is `n - 1`. If `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `n - 1`, and if `a[0][:i + 1]` equals `s[:i + 1]`, then `t` is `n - i - 1` and the loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
