Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 from the last test case, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n from the last test case, `a` is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
        s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
        x = i
        break
else:
    s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
    x = n - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, `a` is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop, `s` is either an empty list or a list containing the concatenation of the substring of `a[0]` from the start to index `i + 1` and the substring of `a[1]` from index `i` to the end, `x` is either 0 or `i` if the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, and if the condition is met, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, `a` is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop, `s` is either unchanged or the concatenation of the substring of `a[0]` from the start to index `i + 1` and the substring of `a[1]` from index `i` to the end if the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, `x` is either unchanged or set to `i` if the condition is met, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, `a` is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop. If `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, then `s` is the concatenation of the substring of `a[0]` from the start to index `i + 1` and the substring of `a[1]` from index `i` to the end, `x` is set to `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
