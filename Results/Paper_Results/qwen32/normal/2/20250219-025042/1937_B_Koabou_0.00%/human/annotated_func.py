#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), the second and third lines contain binary strings of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of the 2 × n grid respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 from the last test case, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n from the last test case, `a` is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, a is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop, s is a list containing the concatenation of a[0] and the last character of a[1], x is n - 1.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1

    #State: t is 1, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, a is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop, s is a list containing the concatenation of a[0] and the last character of a[1], and x is n - 1.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: binary_string1 followed by the last character of binary_string2 (where binary_string1 and binary_string2 are the binary strings of length n provided in the input)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a single test case consisting of two binary strings of equal length. It checks for a specific pattern where the next character in the top string is '1' and the current character in the bottom string is '0'. If such a pattern is found, it constructs a new string by concatenating the part of the top string up to that point with the rest of the bottom string starting from the current position. It also calculates a value `t` based on the position where this pattern was found. The function then prints the constructed string and the value `t`. If no such pattern is found, the behavior as per the given annotations is unclear, but based on the code, it defaults to printing the entire top string concatenated with the last character of the bottom string and `t` as 1.
