The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a fixed number of times (2 in this case). Since the loop iterates exactly twice, there is no need to adjust any variables other than the implicit iteration count.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have completed its first iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the iteration count must reflect that it is now in the second (and final) iteration.

Since `_` does not represent any meaningful state that needs to be preserved or modified, we don't need to change its value explicitly. However, conceptually, we understand that the loop is about to enter its second iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, `a` is a list containing two binary strings**
