You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and two binary strings representing the grid.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` and a variable `x`.
   - It iterates through the columns from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - For each column `i`, it checks if the cell `(1, i+1)` is `1` and the cell `(2, i)` is `0`. If so, it constructs a string `s` by taking the substring from the first row up to and including column `i+1` and appending the rest of the second row starting from column `i`. It also sets `x` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such column is found, it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the entire first row with the last character of the second row. It sets `x` to `n-1`.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The program initializes `t` to 1.
   - It iterates through the columns from 0 to `x-1` (inclusive).
   - For each column `i`, it checks if the substring of the first row up to and including column `i` matches the corresponding substring of `s`. If so, it sets `t` to `x-i+1` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it prints the string `s` and the count `t`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Logic for Constructing the Smallest String:**
   - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. The program only considers the first occurrence where the first row has a `1` and the second row has a `0`. However, there might be other paths that yield a lexicographically smaller string.
   - For example, consider the grid:
     ```
     110
     011
     ```
     The lexicographically smallest string is `0101`, but the program would construct `1101` instead.

2. **Logic for Counting Paths:**
   - The logic for counting the number of paths is also flawed. The program assumes that the number of paths is determined by the first column where the first row matches the constructed string, which is not necessarily true.
   - For example, consider the grid:
     ```
     001
     010
     ```
     The lexicographically smallest string is `0001`, and there are two paths that yield this string, but the program would count only one.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the logic for both constructing the smallest string and counting the number of paths, the program is incorrect.
