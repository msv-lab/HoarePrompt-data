To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

Given:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is defined by the condition that `t` is `n - i` if the substring of `a[0]` from the start to index `i + 1` is equal to the substring of `s` from the start to index `i + 1`.
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop.
- `s` is a list containing the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`.
- `x` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(x):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and `x` was `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x` remains unchanged because it is dependent on `n` and not modified within the loop.

So, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`. The value of `x` remains `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is `n - (i + 1)` if the substring of `a[0]` from the start to index `i + 2` is equal to the substring of `s` from the start to index `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `n - 1`**.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`t` is `n - (i + 1)` if the substring of `a[0]` from the start to index `i + 2` is equal to the substring of `s` from the start to index `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `n - 1`**.
