Given the initial state:
- `t` is `n - (i + 1)` if the substring of `a[0]` from the start to index `i + 2` is equal to the substring of `s` from the start to index `i + 2`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `x` is `n - 1`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
t = x - i + 1
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `t` is recalculated using the formula `x - i + 1`.

Since `x` is `n - 1` and `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, we substitute these into the formula:
- `t = (n - 1) - (i + 1) + 1`
- Simplifying, `t = n - 1 - i - 1 + 1`
- Further simplification gives `t = n - i - 1`

The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is `n - i - 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `n - 1`.**
