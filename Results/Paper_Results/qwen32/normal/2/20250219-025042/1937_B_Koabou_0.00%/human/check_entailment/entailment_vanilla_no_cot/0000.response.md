Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Path Selection**: The program attempts to find the lexicographically smallest string by checking if there's a point where the top row has a '1' and the bottom row has a '0', but it doesn't always choose the optimal path. For example, in the second test case, the program should select the path `11000` but might not due to the logic used.

2. **Path Counting Logic**: The logic for counting the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly account for all possible paths that could lead to the smallest string.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle certain edge cases properly. For instance, when the entire top row is smaller lexicographically, the program might not correctly identify this path.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_lexicographically_smallest_path(a, b, n):
    # Initialize the dp table
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(2)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    dp[1][0] = 0
    
    # Fill the dp table
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + int(a[j - 1])
        dp[1][j] = min(dp[0][j - 1], dp[1][j - 1]) + int(b[j - 1])
    
    # Backtrack to find the lexicographically smallest path
    path = []
    i, j = 1, n
    while j > 0:
        if i == 1 and dp[0][j] <= dp[1][j]:
            path.append(a[j - 1])
            i = 0
        else:
            path.append(b[j - 1])
            i = 1
        j -= 1
    path.reverse()
    
    # Count the number of ways to achieve the smallest path
    count = [0] * (n + 1)
    count[0] = 1
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if path[j - 1] == a[j - 1]:
            count[j] += count[j - 1]
        if path[j - 1] == b[j - 1]:
            count[j] += count[j - 1]
    
    return ''.join(path), count[n]

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    result, num_paths = find_lexicographically_smallest_path(a, b, n)
    print(result)
    print(num_paths)
```

This corrected version uses dynamic programming to find the lexicographically smallest path and counts the number of ways to achieve this path.
