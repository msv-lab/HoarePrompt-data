The value of `t` is calculated as `x - i + 1`. Given that `x` is `n - 1` and `i` is `i + 1`, the value of `t` becomes `(n - 1) - (i + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - i - 1`.

The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `n - 1`, `t` is `n - i - 1`**.
