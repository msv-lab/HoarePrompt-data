Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, the first and second lines contain binary strings of length n, `a` is a list containing the last two binary strings read by the loop, `s` is either unchanged or the concatenation of the substring of `a[0]` from the start to index `i + 1` and the substring of `a[1]` from index `i` to the end if the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, `x` is either unchanged or set to `i` if the condition is met, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is met, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
