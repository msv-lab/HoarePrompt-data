The code snippet provided is simply a `break` statement, which does not affect the values of any variables. It only exits the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `x` is `n - 1`
- `t` is `n - i - 1`

Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the values of `i`, `x`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `n - 1`, `t` is `n - i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
