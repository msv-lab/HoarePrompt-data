The code snippet `pairs_in_D -= 1` decrements the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in the final `D` which is already decreased by 1. After executing the code, `pairs_in_D` will be further decreased by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`; `aa` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements; `m` and `n` are integers; `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with `D[out_aa]` decreased by 1; `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in the final `D` which is decreased by 2; `fnd` is 1 if the new `pairs_in_D` is at least `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0; `k` is an integer; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting occurrences of each element in `bb`; `D[out_aa]` is greater than or equal to 0; `E[out_aa]` is 0.**
