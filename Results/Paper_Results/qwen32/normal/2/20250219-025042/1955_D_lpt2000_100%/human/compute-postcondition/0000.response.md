The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `nabors`. This affects the value of `nabors` but does not change any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `nabors` is an input integer.**
