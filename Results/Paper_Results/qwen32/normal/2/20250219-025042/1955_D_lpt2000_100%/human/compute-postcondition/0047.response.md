The code snippet `E[out_aa] -= 1` decrements the count of `out_aa` in the `E` Counter object by 1.

Given the initial state, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` with the count of `in_aa` incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` == 0, otherwise it is decremented by 1. After executing the code, the count of `out_aa` in `E` is reduced by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `nabors` is greater than or equal to 1, `aa` is a list of strings representing integers read from input, `bb` is a list of strings representing integers read from input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each string in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with counts being the minimum of the counts in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D` plus 1 if `C[in_aa]` > 0, otherwise it is the sum of the values in `D`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D` with the count of `in_aa` incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` == 0, otherwise it is decremented by 1, but now the count of `out_aa` in `E` is decremented by 1, `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D` with the count of `in_aa` decremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` > 0, `fnd` is 2 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ k else 1, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m + 1:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[1:n - m]`.**
