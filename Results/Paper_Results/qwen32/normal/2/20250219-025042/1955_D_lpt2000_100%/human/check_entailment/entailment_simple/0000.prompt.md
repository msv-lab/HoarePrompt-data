Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Output

Note

In the first example, all subsegments are good.

In the second example, good subsegments start at positions 1 , 2 , and 3 .

In the third example, good subsegments start at positions 1 and 2 .
