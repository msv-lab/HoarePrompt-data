Postcondition: **`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `m` and `n` are integers, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`. If `E[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `E[out_aa]` was initially 0, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, resulting in `pairs_in_D` being decreased by 2. `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is at least `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0, `k` is an integer, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting occurrences of each element in `bb`. Additionally, `D[out_aa]` is greater than or equal to 0, and `E[out_aa]` is either 0 or decreased by 1.**
