Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is False, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `nums` is not sorted.**

Natural Language: The variable `ans` has been set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
