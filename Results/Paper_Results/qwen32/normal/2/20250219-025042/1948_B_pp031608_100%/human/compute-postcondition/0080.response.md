The given code snippet creates a new list `nums` by converting the integer `arr[i - 1]` into its individual digits and appending `arr[i]` to this list of digits.

Let's break down the changes:
- `nums` is now a list that contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.

No other variables are modified in this code snippet. The conditions and constraints on `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-2` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `i` is 1, `ans` remains unchanged.**
