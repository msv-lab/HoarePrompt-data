In this task, the loop head only contains the variable `_` and `n`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times (`n` times) and does not retain any state between iterations. Therefore, the only variable that needs adjustment is `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` was such that it allowed the loop to run. Since the loop iterates `n` times, after each iteration, `n` effectively decreases by 1 implicitly through the loop mechanism itself. However, since we are only adjusting the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to reflect the decrement of `n` manually.

Given that the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0, we need to decrease `n` by 1 to prepare for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-2` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers potentially modified based on the loop's condition checks, and `ans` is either True if no unsorted `nums` was found, or False if an unsorted `nums` was found and caused the loop to break.**
