The given code snippet creates a new list `nums` by converting the integer `arr[i - 1]` into its individual digits and appending `arr[i]` to the end of this list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99
- `m` is at least 2
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `i` is `n-3`
- If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, `i` is `n-3`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`
- If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

The code modifies the `nums` list as follows:
- `nums` is set to the list of digits of `arr[i - 1]` concatenated with `[arr[i]]`.

Thus, the new value of `nums` is derived from `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `n-3`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
