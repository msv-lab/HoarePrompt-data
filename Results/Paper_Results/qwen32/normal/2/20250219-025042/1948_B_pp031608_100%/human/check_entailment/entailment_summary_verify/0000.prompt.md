You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers. For each test case, it determines if the list can be modified by replacing each pair of adjacent elements (from right to left) with a new element formed by concatenating the digits of the larger element followed by the smaller element, such that the resulting list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It outputs 'YES' if such modifications can result in a sorted list, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Program Analysis

The task is to determine if it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits and inserting them back into the array at the same position.

Here's the provided program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Sorting**:
   - The program checks if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and then attempts to split `arr[i - 1]` and check if the resulting list is sorted.
   - However, the logic does not correctly handle the transformation of the array. It only checks if the immediate neighbors can be sorted after splitting, but it doesn't account for the possibility of further splits needed to achieve a fully sorted array.

2. **Incomplete Handling of Splits**:
   - The program only performs a single split and checks the immediate effect. It does not recursively or iteratively ensure that the entire array can be sorted through multiple splits.
   - For example, consider an array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. After splitting `12`, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`. However, the program does not check if further splits are needed to sort the array completely.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split and rearranged to achieve a sorted array.
   - For instance, an array like `[32, 10, 1]` would require splitting `32` into `[3, 2]` and then rearranging to `[1, 2, 3, 0, 1]`, which can be sorted.

### Counterexample

Consider the following input:
```
1
3
32 10 1
```

- The program will check if `1 < 10` (which is true), then split `10` into `[1, 0]` and check if `[1, 0, 1]` is sorted. Since it is not, the program will incorrectly output `NO`.
- However, the correct transformation would be to split `32` into `[3, 2]`, resulting in `[3, 2, 10, 1]`, which can be rearranged to `[1, 2, 3, 10]` and thus sorted.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted through the described operations. It fails to handle multiple splits and rearrangements necessary to achieve a fully sorted array.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The program incorrectly assumes that a single split and immediate neighbor check is sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted. It does not account for the need for multiple splits and rearrangements to achieve a fully sorted array, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
