The given Python code snippet sets the variable `ans` to `True`. This action does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`). The only change is that `ans` is explicitly set to `True`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is now `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is True.**
