The given code snippet creates a new list `nums` by concatenating two parts: the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` (converted to a string and then back to a list of integers) and the integer `arr[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99
- `m` is at least 2
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input
- `i` is `n-2`

Let's determine the output state:

- `nums` is created by taking the integer at index `i-1` in `arr`, converting it to a string, then to a list of its digits, and appending the integer at index `i` in `arr` to this list.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `n-2`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
