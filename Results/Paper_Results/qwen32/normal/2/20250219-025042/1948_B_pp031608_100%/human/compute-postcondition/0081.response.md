Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-2` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `i` is 1, `ans` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
