To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `i`, `m`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop iterates from `m-1` down to `1` (inclusive) with a decrement of `1` in each iteration.

### Analysis:

- **Current State:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value between `1` and `m-1` (inclusive).
- **Loop Condition:** The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than `0`.
- **Decrement:** In each iteration, `i` is decremented by `1`.

### Adjustment for Next Iteration:

Since the loop decrements `i` by `1` in each iteration, to find the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by `1` from its current value at the end of the previous iteration.

### Example Adjustment:

If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k` (where `1 <= k <= m-1`), then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

However, since the loop decrements `i` and stops when `i` becomes `0`, the highest possible value for `i` at the start of any iteration is `m-1`. Therefore, if `i` is currently `1` (the last iteration before the loop terminates), it means the loop will terminate in the next iteration, and there won't be a "next" iteration to adjust.

### Final State:

Given that the only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`, and considering the loop's decrement nature, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- If `i` is currently `k` (`1 <= k <= m-1`), then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.
- If `i` is `1`, the loop will terminate in the next iteration, so there is no next iteration to consider.

For the general case, assuming `i` is not `1` (i.e., there is a next iteration):

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration (and `1 <= k < m-1`).**

If `i` is `1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will terminate, and there is no next iteration to adjust.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1 (indicating the last iteration before termination).**

Since the task specifies to adjust only the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head only contains `i` and `m`, and `m` remains unchanged, the final state adjustment is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `i` is `i + 1` where `i` is the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration (and `1 <= i < m-1`).**

If `i` is `1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will terminate, and there is no next iteration to adjust. However, generally, we assume there is a next iteration unless specified otherwise.

So, the most general answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `i` is `i + 1` where `i` is the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration (and `1 <= i < m-1`).**
