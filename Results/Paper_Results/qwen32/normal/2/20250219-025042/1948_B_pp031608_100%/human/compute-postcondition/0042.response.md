Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer and `n-1` (and must still be greater than or equal to 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` (before the assignment) followed by `arr[i]`, and if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains True and no other changes are made to `arr` or `nums`.**
