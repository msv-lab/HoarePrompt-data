To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the variables and their relationships as described in the initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n`: An integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `a`: A list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 99\).
- `m`: An input integer.
- `arr`: A list of integers that may be modified based on some loop conditions.
- `ans`: A boolean value (either `True` or `False`) indicating whether any `nums` (presumably another list or related to `arr`) was unsorted.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Analysis:
The print statement uses a list indexing technique to select between two strings, `'NO'` and `'YES'`, based on the value of `ans`.

- If `ans` is `False`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][False]`, which is equivalent to `['NO', 'YES'][0]`, resulting in the string `'NO'`.
- If `ans` is `True`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][True]`, which is equivalent to `['NO', 'YES'][1]`, resulting in the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The output depends on the value of `ans`. Since `ans` is a boolean value indicating whether any `nums` was unsorted, the output will be `'NO'` if `nums` was sorted and `'YES'` if `nums` was unsorted.

Output: **'NO' if ans is False, 'YES' if ans is True**
