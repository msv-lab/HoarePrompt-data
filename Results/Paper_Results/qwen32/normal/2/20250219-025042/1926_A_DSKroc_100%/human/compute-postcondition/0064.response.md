The value of `ac` is incremented by 1. Given that `ac` was initially either 0, 1, or 2, after incrementing, `ac` will be either 1, 2, or 3 respectively. The values of `bc`, `t`, `q`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ac` is either 1, 2, or 3; `bc` is either 0, 1, or 2; `t` remains unchanged; `q` is `q + 1`; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is the next character in `s`.**
