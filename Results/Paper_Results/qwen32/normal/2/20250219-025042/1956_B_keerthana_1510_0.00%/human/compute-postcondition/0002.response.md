Let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), which represents the number of integers in the list.
  - The second line contains a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list at most 2 times.
- `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line of input by whitespace.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **`{*elements}`**: This creates a set from the `elements` list, which removes any duplicate values. Therefore, it contains unique integers from the list.
   
2. **`elements.count(item)`**: For each unique integer `item` in the set, this counts how many times `item` appears in the `elements` list.

3. **`elements.count(item) // 3`**: This performs integer division of the count of `item` by 3. Since each integer in the list appears at most 2 times, `elements.count(item)` will always be either 1, 2, or 0. Dividing these by 3 using integer division (`//`) will always result in 0 because:
   - If `elements.count(item)` is 0, then `0 // 3` is 0.
   - If `elements.count(item)` is 1, then `1 // 3` is 0.
   - If `elements.count(item)` is 2, then `2 // 3` is 0.

4. **`sum(...)`**: The `sum` function adds up all the results from the previous step. Since each term in the sum is 0 (as explained above), the total sum will also be 0.

### Conclusion:
Given that each integer in the list `elements` appears at most 2 times, the expression `elements.count(item) // 3` will always evaluate to 0 for every unique `item` in `elements`. Therefore, the sum of these values will be 0.

Output: **0**
