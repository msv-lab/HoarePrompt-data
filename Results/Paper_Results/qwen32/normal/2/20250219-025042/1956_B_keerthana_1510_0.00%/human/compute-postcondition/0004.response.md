The code provided splits the content of the variable `line` by whitespace and assigns the resulting list of strings to the variable `elements`. This means that `elements` will now hold a list of strings derived from `line`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the operation performed on `line`. Only `elements` is updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; the following lines consist of pairs of lines for each test case, where the first line of each pair is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the second line is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list `a` at most 2 times; `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` by whitespace; `line` holds the content of the next line to be processed in the loop.**
