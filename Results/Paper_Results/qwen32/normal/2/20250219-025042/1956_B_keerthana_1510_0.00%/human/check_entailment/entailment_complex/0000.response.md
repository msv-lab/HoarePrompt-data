### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We have a deck of `2n` cards with integers from `1` to `n`, each appearing exactly twice.
- Cards are distributed between two players, each receiving `n` cards.
- Players take turns placing cards on a table, and a player earns a point if the card they place matches a card already on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- We need to find the maximum number of points you can score if you also play optimally.

#### Key Observations:
- Since each card appears exactly twice, the maximum points you can earn is `n/2` (if every card you play matches a card on the table).
- However, since Nene plays optimally, she will try to prevent you from scoring points whenever possible.
- The critical insight here is that if you have a pair of cards, you can only score a point if Nene hasn't already placed one of those cards on the table.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of each unique card and dividing by 3. This approach doesn't align with the problem's requirements because:
- Counting occurrences and dividing by 3 doesn't directly relate to the game's rules or how points are scored.
- The code doesn't simulate the game or account for Nene's optimal strategy.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game considering Nene's optimal strategy. Here's a high-level outline of the correct approach:
1. Track which cards are on the table.
2. Simulate the turns, alternating between you and Nene.
3. Use a greedy strategy to decide which card to play next, considering Nene's optimal moves.

Given the complexity of simulating the game with optimal strategies, the provided code is not correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
