To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given code and the initial state:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the list (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list `a` at most 2 times.
- `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` by whitespace, where `line` holds the content of the next line to be processed in the loop.

### Code Analysis:
```python
print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
```

1. **`{*elements}`**: This creates a set from the `elements` list, which removes any duplicate values. So, if `elements` was `['1', '2', '2', '3']`, the set would be `{'1', '2', '3'}`.
2. **`elements.count(item)`**: For each unique item in the set, this counts how many times it appears in the original `elements` list.
3. **`elements.count(item) // 3`**: This performs integer division of the count by 3, effectively counting how many groups of 3 identical items exist for each unique item.
4. **`sum(...)`**: This sums up the results of the previous operation for all unique items in the set.

### Explanation of the Output:
Given the constraints, each integer from 1 to n appears in the list `a` at most 2 times. Therefore, the count of any item in `elements` will be either 0, 1, or 2. Since we are performing integer division by 3 (`// 3`), the result of `elements.count(item) // 3` will always be 0 because no count can be 3 or more.

Thus, the sum of these results will also be 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
