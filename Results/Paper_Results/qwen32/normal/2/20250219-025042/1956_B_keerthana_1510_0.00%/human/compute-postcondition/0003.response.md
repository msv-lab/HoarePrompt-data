In the given task, the loop iterates over every second line starting from the third line (index 2) of the input file. The loop variable is `line`, which represents each of these lines.

Here's the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- The following lines consist of pairs of lines for each test case, where the first line of each pair is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the second line is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list `a` at most 2 times.
- `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` by whitespace.

The loop statement is:
```python
for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses. The loop skips the first two lines and then processes every second line thereafter. 

Given the current state, `line` holds the content of the last processed line. To move to the next iteration, `line` should hold the content of the next line in the sequence that the loop processes.

Let's denote the current line number being processed as `current_line_number`. Since the loop starts at line 3 and processes every second line, if the current line number is `current_line_number`, the next line number to be processed will be `current_line_number + 2`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `line` will hold the content of the next line to be processed, which is `current_line_number + 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `elements`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop header.

Since we don't have the exact value of `current_line_number` from the previous state, we can express the state in terms of the progression of the loop:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; the following lines consist of pairs of lines for each test case, where the first line of each pair is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the second line is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list `a` at most 2 times; `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` by whitespace; `line` holds the content of the next line to be processed, which is `current_line_number + 2`.**

However, since we don't have `current_line_number`, we can simply state that `line` will hold the next line in the sequence that the loop processes:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; the following lines consist of pairs of lines for each test case, where the first line of each pair is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the second line is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list `a` at most 2 times; `elements` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` by whitespace; `line` holds the content of the next line to be processed in the loop.**
