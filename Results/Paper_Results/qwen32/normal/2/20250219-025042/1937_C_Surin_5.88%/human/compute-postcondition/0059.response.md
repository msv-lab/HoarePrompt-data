The provided code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the standard output. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state and the fact that `sys.stdout.flush()` does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `v2` is `i`.**
