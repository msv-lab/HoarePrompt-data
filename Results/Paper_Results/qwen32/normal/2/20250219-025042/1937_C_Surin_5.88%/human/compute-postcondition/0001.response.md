The given code snippet defines a new lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it. This definition does not affect the existing variables `t`, `n`, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`, or the existing lambda function `I`. 

Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new lambda function `R`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴. The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10⁴. `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers. `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.**
