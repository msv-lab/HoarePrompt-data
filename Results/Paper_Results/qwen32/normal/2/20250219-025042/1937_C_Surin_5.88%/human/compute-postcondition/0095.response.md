The given code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not affect any of the variables or their values.

Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, `kp`, `v2`, `r`, or `i` are modified by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which the input `r` was '<', `prev` is 2 if `r` was '>', otherwise `prev` remains 0, `kp` is incremented by 1 for each time `r` was '<', `v2` is n-1, `r` is either '>' or '<' (as read from the input), `i` is 3**.
