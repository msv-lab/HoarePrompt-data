The code snippet reads a new input and assigns it to the variable `r`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, or `v2`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `r` which holds the value of the newly read input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, `r` is the newly read input.**
