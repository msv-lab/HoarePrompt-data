Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, I is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, R is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `prev` is the last index i for which the input r was '>', `kp` is incremented by 1, `v2` is n-1, `r` is the input string from the last iteration, `i` is n
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    v2 = i
    print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input('')
    if r == '<':
        v1 = v2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 1, `v2` is 1, `r` is the newly read input. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `r` is the newly read input. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `v1` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3, `r` is the newly read input, and `v1` is 3 if `r` equals '<'. Otherwise, `v1` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
