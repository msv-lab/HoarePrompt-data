To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³,
- `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴,
- The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1},
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers,
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it,
- `g` is 0,
- `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`,
- `prev` is 4 if `r` was `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged,
- `r` is the newly input string,
- `i` is 4.

Since the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 5 at the start of the next iteration.

The variable `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`, `prev` is 4 if `r` was `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, `r` is the newly input string, `i` is 5**
