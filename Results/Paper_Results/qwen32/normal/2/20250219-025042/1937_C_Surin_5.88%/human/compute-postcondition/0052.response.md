The only variable in the loop head is `kp`, which is the loop variable in the `for` loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as `kp` is less than the integer value obtained from `input()`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `kp` has just completed its current iteration. To prepare for the next iteration, `kp` needs to be incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

Let's assume that `kp` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `kp` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`, `kp` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `kp` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `kp` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'>'`, `kp` is incremented by 1**.
