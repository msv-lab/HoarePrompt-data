Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
2. **`n`**: An integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴.
3. **`p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`**: A permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
4. **`I`**: A lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
5. **`R`**: A lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
6. **`g`**: Initialized to 0.
7. **`v1`**: Initialized to 0.
8. **`v2`**: Initialized to `i`. However, there is no variable `i` defined in the initial state. Given this, it seems there might be a mistake in the description. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume `v2` is intended to be initialized to some specific value or perhaps a typo, and we'll proceed with `v2` being `0` as it's the only logical default without additional context.

### Print Statement Analysis:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Given the initial state, we know:
- `v1` is explicitly set to `0`.
- `v2` is assumed to be `0` due to the lack of definition for `i`.

### Substituting Values:
- `{v1}` will be replaced with `0`.
- `{v2}` will also be replaced with `0`.

### Final Output:
The formatted string will be:
```
? 0 0 0 0
```

### Conclusion:
Output: **? 0 0 0 0**
