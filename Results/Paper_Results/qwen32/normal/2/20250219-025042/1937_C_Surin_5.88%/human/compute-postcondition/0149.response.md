To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the variables.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
   - `n`: A newly read integer from the input such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\)
   - `i`: Initially set to `n`
   - `v2`: Initially set to `n-1`
   - `r`: Initially set to the newly read input from the last iteration
   - `v1`: The largest index \(j\) for which the input `r` was `<`
   - `prev`: Initially set to `0`

2. **Loop Body**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, it prints a query and reads the response `r`.
   - If `r` is `'>'`, it updates `prev` to the current value of `i`.

### Iteration Details:
- **First Iteration (i=1)**:
  - Query: `? v1 1 v1 prev`
  - If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` becomes `1`.
  - `v1` remains the largest index where `r` was `'<'`.

- **Second Iteration (i=2)**:
  - Query: `? v1 2 v1 prev`
  - If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` becomes `2`.
  - `v1` remains the largest index where `r` was `'<'`.

- **Third Iteration (i=3)**:
  - Query: `? v1 3 v1 prev`
  - If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` becomes `3`.
  - `v1` remains the largest index where `r` was `'<'`.

### Final Iteration (i=n-1):
- The loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`.
- For each iteration, if `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is updated to the current `i`.
- `v1` remains the largest index where `r` was `'<'`.

### Final State:
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n` (since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`).
- `v2` remains `n-1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `r` will be the result of the last query response.
- `v1` will still be the largest index where `r` was `'<'`.
- `prev` will be the largest `i` for which `r` was `'>'`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state is:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `i` is `n`.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `r` is the result of the last query response.
- `v1` is the largest index where `r` was `'<'`.
- `prev` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'>'`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, n is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, i is n, v2 is n-1, r is the newly read input from the last iteration, v1 is the largest index j for which the input r was '<', prev is the largest i for which r was '>'.**
