The provided code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not affect any of the variables or their values. Therefore, none of the variables in the initial state are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`, `prev` is `i` if `r` was `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, and `r` is the input string, `i` is 4**.
