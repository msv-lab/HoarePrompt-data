Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is initialized to 2.
- `v2` is initialized to 2.
- `r` is the newly read input.
  - If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is a formatted string that includes the values of `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`.
- From the initial state, we know that `v2` is explicitly set to 2.
- The value of `v1` depends on the value of `r`. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `v1` is not specified in the initial state, but since the condition is met in the problem statement, we assume `r` equals '<'.

### Conclusion:
- Given that `r` equals '<', `v1` is set to 1.
- Therefore, the print statement will output `? 1 1 2 2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
