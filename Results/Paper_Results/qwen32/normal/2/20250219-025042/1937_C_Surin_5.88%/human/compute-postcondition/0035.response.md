The given code snippet only contains the line `prev = i`. However, there is no variable `i` defined in the initial state. Given the context, it seems like `i` might be intended to be another variable that holds some index value, possibly related to the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` or some iteration over the input.

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. Therefore, we'll assume that `i` holds some value that is relevant to the context, and we'll update `prev` accordingly.

Given that `prev` is initially set to 0, after executing `prev = i`, `prev` will take the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the integer read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`, `prev` is `i`, `r` is the input string and `r` equals `'>'`.**
