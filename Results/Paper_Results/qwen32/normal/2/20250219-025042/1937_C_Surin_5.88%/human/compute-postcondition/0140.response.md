The code snippet reads a new input value and assigns it to `r`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `v2`, `prev`, or `v1`. The only change is that `r` now holds the newly read input value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is n-1, `v2` is n-1, `r` is the newly read input from the current iteration, `prev` is set to `n` if `r` equals '>', otherwise `prev` remains 0, `v1` is the largest index j for which the input `r` was '<'.**
