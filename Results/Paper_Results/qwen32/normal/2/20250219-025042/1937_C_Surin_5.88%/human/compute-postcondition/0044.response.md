To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their Initial States:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
   - `n`: An integer read from the input between 2 and 10000 (inclusive).
   - `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}`: A permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
   - `I`: A lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.
   - `R`: A lambda function that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
   - `g`: Initialized to 0.
   - `v1`: The largest index `i` for which the input `r` was `'<'`. Since no specific input for `r` is mentioned prior to this point, we cannot determine the exact value of `v1` from the given information. However, based on the context, we can infer that `v1` is some integer index.
   - `prev`: Set to 4 if `r` was `'>'`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. Again, without knowing the previous value of `prev` or the value of `r`, we cannot determine the exact value of `prev`. We'll denote it as `prev` in the output.
   - `r`: The newly input string. The value of `r` is not specified, so we cannot determine its exact value.
   - `i`: Set to 5.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')`.
   - This statement will print a formatted string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1` again, and `prev`.

Given the above analysis, the output will be in the form `? v1 i v1 prev`, where `v1` and `prev` are determined by the previous inputs and operations in the code, and `i` is explicitly given as 5.

Output: **? [v1] 5 [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the largest index i for which r was '<', and prev is 4 if r was '>', otherwise it remains unchanged)**
