The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `I` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers. This lambda function does not affect the variables `t` or `n` or the sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` directly. It merely sets up a way to read and process input data.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of the lambda function `I`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴. The sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10⁴. `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.**
