Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a permutation `p` of the sequence `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. For each test case, it outputs two indices based on specific comparisons made through queries. The first index is the largest index `i` for which a certain comparison condition holds true, and the second index is another significant index derived from the permutation.**
