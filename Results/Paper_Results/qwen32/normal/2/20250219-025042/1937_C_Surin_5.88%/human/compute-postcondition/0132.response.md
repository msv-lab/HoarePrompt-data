The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. However, it does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `v2`, `r`, `v1`, or `prev` are modified by this command.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the newly read integer from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `i` is n, `v2` is n-1, `r` is the newly read input from the last iteration, `v1` is the largest index j for which the input r was '<', `prev` is 0**.
