Let's analyze the given code snippet and determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `i` is updated to `i + 1` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`; otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.
- `b` remains the same.

Code Snippet:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

The value of `x` is calculated based on the current value of `i` and `a`. Since the value of `i` could have been incremented or remained the same based on the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, we need to consider both scenarios:

1. If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` was true, `i` was incremented by 1.
2. If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` was false, `i` remained unchanged.

However, the calculation of `x` does not depend on whether `i` was incremented or not; it only depends on the current value of `i` and `a`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `i` is either `i + 1` or `i` depending on the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.
- `b` remains the same.
- `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged; `b` remains the same; `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.**
