The code snippet `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Given the initial state, `suma` was either `a + 1` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, or `0` otherwise. After executing the code, `suma` will be updated to its previous value plus `x`.

Since `x` is defined as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, the new value of `suma` can be expressed as:

- If `suma` was `a + 1` initially, then `suma` becomes `(a + 1) + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`.
- If `suma` was `0` initially, then `suma` becomes `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`suma` is either `(a + 1) + ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, or `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` otherwise; `t` is incremented by 1; `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is at least 1; `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**.
