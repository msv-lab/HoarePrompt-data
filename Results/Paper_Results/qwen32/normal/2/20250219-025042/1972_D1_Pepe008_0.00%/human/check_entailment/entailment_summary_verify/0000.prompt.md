You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it computes a specific sum based on these integers and outputs the result minus one.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\),
- \(1 \le b \le m\),
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases and calculates the number of valid pairs for each test case. Here's the relevant part of the program:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)

func()
```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Logic Verification**: The logic inside the loop seems to be derived from some mathematical insight or formula, but it's not immediately clear how it relates to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. **Edge Cases**: We should check if the program handles edge cases correctly, such as when \(n\) or \(m\) is 1.
3. **Correctness of Formula**: The formula used to compute `x` and `suma` needs to be verified against the problem statement.

### Testing the Program:
Let's manually verify the program with the provided example inputs.

#### Test Case 1:
Input:
```
1
1 1

```

Input:
```
1
10 8
```

```
Expected Output:
```
1643498
```
Program Output:
```
1643498
```
This test case passes.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided test cases, the program seems to produce the correct output. However, without a formal proof or derivation of the formula used in the program, we cannot be 100% certain that it works for all possible inputs. Nevertheless, since the program produces the correct results for the given test cases and no obvious errors or logical flaws are present, we can reasonably assume that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program passes all provided test cases and appears to implement the correct logic to solve the problem as described. No edge cases or errors were found during manual testing.
