The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases, which was previously described as `t` in the initial state. After executing the code, the value of `T` will be the same as the value of `t` provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4. Each of the next T lines contains two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. The sum of all n and the sum of all m across all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.**
