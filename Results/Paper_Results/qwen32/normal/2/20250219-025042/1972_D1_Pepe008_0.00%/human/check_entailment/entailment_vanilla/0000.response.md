Let's analyze the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

This means there exists an integer \(k\) such that:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

### Code Analysis

The provided code does not directly implement the above logic. Instead, it seems to be trying to count pairs using some mathematical manipulation, but it's not immediately clear what it's doing. Let's break down the code:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            x = (n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if n - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)
```

#### Key Points:
1. The outer loop iterates over possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each `b`, it calculates `x` as `(n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
3. It adds `x` to `suma` if `n - i * (i - 1) > 0`.
4. Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

### Checking the Logic

The logic in the code does not align with the problem statement. The code seems to be counting something related to the values of `a` and `b`, but it doesn't correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach

A more straightforward approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs (a, b) and checking the condition directly. However, this would be inefficient given the constraints. A more optimized approach might involve mathematical insights or properties of the gcd function, but the provided code does not seem to follow such an approach correctly.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
