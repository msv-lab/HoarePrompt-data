To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop's header. The loop header is:

```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
```

This means the loop will iterate over the range starting from 1 up to (but not including) `b + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be at least 1. 

Here are the variables in the loop header:
- `i`: This is the loop variable and its initial value is determined by the range function.
- `b`: This is the upper limit of the range, minus one.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `suma` is 0.
- `t` is incremented by 1 (though `t` is not part of the loop header).
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.

Since `t` is not part of the loop header, it does not need to be adjusted. The other variables (`suma`, `info`, `a`) are also not part of the loop header and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

The only variable in the loop header that needs to be adjusted is `b`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `b` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`suma` is 0, `t` is incremented by 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1**.
