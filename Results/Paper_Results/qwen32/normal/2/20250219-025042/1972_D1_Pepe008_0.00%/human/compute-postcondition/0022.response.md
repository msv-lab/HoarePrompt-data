The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns this list to the variable `info`. This operation does not affect the variables `suma`, which is the sum of certain `x` values, or `t`, which is incremented by 1 in the initial state description.

Therefore, the values of `suma` and `t` remain unchanged. The new variable `info` holds the list of strings obtained from the input.

Output State: **`suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, with `i` ranging from 1 to `b`; `t` is incremented by 1; `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
