Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, the length of `s` is a positive integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If the length of `alphabet` is not equal to 1, `alphabet` excludes the character `i`. If the length of `alphabet` is 1, `s2` is a string that includes the character `i` appended to its previous value.**
