#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, and the length of s is a positive integer m such that 1 <= m <= 1000. Additionally, it is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: `s1` is equal to `s`, `s2` contains the last character of `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing three elements: (1) a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, (2) a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and (3) the last character of `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and returns a tuple. The tuple contains a boolean indicating if the length of `s` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s` starting from a specific index, and the last character of `s`.
