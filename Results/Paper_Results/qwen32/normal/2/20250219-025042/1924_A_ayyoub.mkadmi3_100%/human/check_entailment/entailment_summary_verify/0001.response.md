### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness based on the given function summary and the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences in the given string `s`. If not, we need to identify one such string that does not appear as a subsequence.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of a main loop that processes each test case and a helper function `func_1`. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Main Loop**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
   - Calls `func_1(s, k, n)` to get a tuple `(b, s1, s2)`.
   - If `b` is `False`, it means not all subsequences are present, and it attempts to construct a missing subsequence.
   - If `b` is `True`, it prints "YES".

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase letters.
   - Iterates through the string `s`, removing characters from the alphabet set as they appear.
   - Constructs `s1` by appending characters from `s` that are in the alphabet set.
   - Resets the alphabet set once it becomes empty and appends the current character to `s2`.
   - Returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if `s1` is long enough (`len(s1) >= n * k`), a substring of `s1`, and `s2`.

#### Function Summary Evaluation:
The function summary states that `func_1` returns a tuple with a boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1`, and the last character of `s`. This summary does not fully capture the intended functionality of checking for all possible subsequences of length `n`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Subsequence Checking**:
   - The function `func_1` does not actually check if all possible subsequences of length `n` exist in `s`. It only checks if `s1` is long enough, which is not sufficient.
   
2. **Constructing Missing Subsequences**:
   - The logic for constructing a missing subsequence is flawed. It simply finds the first character not in `s1` and repeats it, which does not guarantee that this will be a missing subsequence.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where `n` is large relative to `k` or when `s` contains repeated characters in a way that makes certain subsequences impossible.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 2 6
aababb
```
- All possible strings of length 3 using 'a' and 'b' are: `aaa, aab, aba, abb, baa, bab, bba, bbb`.
- The string "aababb" does not contain `aaa, aba, abb, bab, bba, bbb` as subsequences.
- The program should output `NO` followed by any of these missing subsequences, such as `aaa`.

However, the provided program might incorrectly output `YES` or an incorrect subsequence because it does not properly check for all possible subsequences.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to check for all possible subsequences of length `n` and constructs missing subsequences incorrectly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
