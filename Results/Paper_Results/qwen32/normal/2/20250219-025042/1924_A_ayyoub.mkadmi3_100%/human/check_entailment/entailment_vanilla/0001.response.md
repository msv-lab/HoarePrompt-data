Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.
   - It initializes an empty string `s1` to collect characters from `s` that are within the first `k` lowercase letters.
   - It also initializes an empty string `s2` and a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase letters.
   - As it iterates through `s`, it adds characters to `s1` if they are within the `alphabet`.
   - When `alphabet` becomes empty, it appends the current character to `s2` and resets `alphabet`.
   - The function returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)` where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.

3. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function is supposed to check if all possible combinations of length `n` exist as subsequences in `s`. However, the current implementation does not actually perform this check.
   - The condition `len(s1) >= n * k` does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` are present as subsequences in `s`.
   - The returned values `s1[r * k:]` and `s2` do not help in determining the absence of a required subsequence.

4. **Output Generation:**
   - The program checks the boolean value returned by `func_1`. If it is `False`, it attempts to generate a missing string.
   - The generated string is not guaranteed to be a string that is missing as a subsequence in `s`.

5. **Example Test Cases:**
   - The program fails to produce the correct output for the provided example test cases. For instance, for the second test case, the program should output "NO" and "aa", but the current implementation does not correctly identify "aa" as a missing subsequence.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality to solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` is insufficient to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`, and the method for generating a missing string is flawed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
