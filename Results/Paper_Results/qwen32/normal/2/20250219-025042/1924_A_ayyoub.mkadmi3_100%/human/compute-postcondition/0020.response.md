The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the characters in the string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to the next character in the string `s` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26.
- The length of `s` is a positive integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000.
- `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `i` is the next character in the string `s`.

To prepare for the next iteration:
- `i` should be updated to the next character in the string `s`.

Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, the next value of `i` will be the character following the current `i` in the string `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, the length of `s` is a positive integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `i`.** 

However, to be more precise about the change in `i`, if `i` was the `j`-th character in `s`, then in the next iteration, `i` will be the `(j+1)`-th character in `s`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, the length of `s` is a positive integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `i`.** 

If we denote the current character as `s[j]`, then the next character will be `s[j+1]`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, the length of `s` is a positive integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is `s[j+1]` where `s[j]` is the current character.**

Since we don't have the exact position `j` of the current character `i` in the string `s`, we can simply say `i` is the next character in `s`:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, the length of `s` is a positive integer `m` such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in the string `s`.**
