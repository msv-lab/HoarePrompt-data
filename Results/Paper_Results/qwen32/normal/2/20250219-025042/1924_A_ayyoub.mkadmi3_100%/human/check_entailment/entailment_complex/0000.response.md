### Reasoning:

The given annotated program aims to solve the problem by checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the string `s`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to determine if the string `s` contains all possible subsequences of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It initializes an empty string `s1` and `s2`, and a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`. If the character is in `alphabet`, it removes the character from `alphabet` (unless `alphabet` has only one element left, in which case it adds the character to `s2` and resets `alphabet`).
   - It appends the character to `s1`.
   - After processing the string, it calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2`.

3. **Post-Function Processing:**
   - The main loop checks the boolean value returned by `func_1`.
   - If the boolean is `False`, it means not all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`. It then constructs a string that is not a subsequence of `s` and appends 'NO' and this string to the output list `OUT`.
   - If the boolean is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the output list `OUT`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints all elements in the `OUT` list.

### Issues in the Logic:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly determine if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`. It simply checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, which is insufficient.
- The construction of the missing subsequence in the case where the boolean is `False` is flawed. It assumes that the missing subsequence can be constructed by appending characters not in `s1` to `s2`, which is not necessarily true.
- The logic for determining the missing subsequence is incorrect and does not guarantee that the constructed string will not be a subsequence of `s`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the logic of `func_1` and the construction of the missing subsequence, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
