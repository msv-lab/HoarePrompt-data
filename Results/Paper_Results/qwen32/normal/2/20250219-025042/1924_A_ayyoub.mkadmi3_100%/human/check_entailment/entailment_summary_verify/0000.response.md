### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in the string `s`.
- If not, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Main Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It calls `func_1(s, k, n)` to get a tuple `(b, s1, s2)`.
   - If `b` is `False`, it constructs a string that is not a subsequence and appends "NO" and this string to `OUT`.
   - If `b` is `True`, it appends "YES" to `OUT`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes an empty string `s1` and `s2`.
   - It creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase letters.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - If the character is in `alphabet`, it removes it from `alphabet` if `alphabet` has more than one element.
     - If `alphabet` has only one element, it adds the character to `s2` and resets `alphabet`.
     - It adds the character to `s1`.
   - It calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Logic of `func_1`**:
   - The function does not correctly check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.
   - The function's logic for constructing `s1` and `s2` does not align with the requirement to verify all subsequences.
   - The function does not generate or check for all possible subsequences of length `n`.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequences**:
   - The program attempts to generate a missing subsequence by finding the first character not in `s1` and repeating it, which is insufficient and incorrect.
   - This approach does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid missing subsequence.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `n` is large relative to `k` or when `s` contains repeated characters in a way that makes certain subsequences impossible.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3 2 6
aababb
```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  aaa
  ```
- Explanation:
  - All possible strings of length 3 using 'a' and 'b' are: aaa, aab, aba, abb, baa, bab, bba, bbb.
  - The string "aababb" does not contain "aaa", "aba", "abb", "bab", "bba", or "bbb" as subsequences.
  - The program should output "NO" followed by any of these missing subsequences, such as "aaa".
- The provided program might incorrectly output "YES" or an incorrect subsequence because it does not properly check for all possible subsequences.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues and the counterexample, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final:** **False**
