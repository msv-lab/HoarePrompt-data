Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the smallest `x` encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest `x` encountered when `a` was 1, and `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`.**
