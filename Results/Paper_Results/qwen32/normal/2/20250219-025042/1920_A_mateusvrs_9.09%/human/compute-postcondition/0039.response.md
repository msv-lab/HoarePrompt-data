Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the smallest `x` encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest `x` encountered when `a` was 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element, `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is 1, and `i` is an integer such that `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and `i` is less than or equal to `ax`.**

Explanation: The value of `tmp` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
