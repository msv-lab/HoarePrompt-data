The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This means that the values of `a` and `x` will be updated based on the input provided.

Given the initial state, `t`, `n`, `r`, `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` remain unchanged. Only `a` and `x` are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is decremented by 1, `r` is a list as defined previously, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are calculated based on the value of `a` and `x` as described.**

In simpler terms, `a` and `x` are now set to the values provided by the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
