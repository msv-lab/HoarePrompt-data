The given code snippet only initializes a new variable `tmp` to 0 and does not modify any of the existing variables `ax`, `bx`, or `cx`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the addition of `tmp`.

Output State: **`ax` is the smallest value from inputs where `a == 2`, `bx` is the largest value from inputs where `a == 1`, and `cx` is a set of all unique values from inputs where `a == 3`. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`; `tmp` is 0.**
