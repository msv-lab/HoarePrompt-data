The code snippet provided increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Given the initial state, `tmp` could either be 1 or 2. After executing `tmp += 1`, `tmp` will be either 2 or 3 respectively.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the smallest `x` encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest `x` encountered when `a` was 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the next element in `cx` after `next_i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 3; otherwise, `tmp` is 2.**
