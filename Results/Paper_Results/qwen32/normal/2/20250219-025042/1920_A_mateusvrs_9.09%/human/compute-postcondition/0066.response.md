In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head only contains the variable `_` and `n`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `n` times, and it does not affect the loop condition directly. The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500,
- `n` is greater than 0,
- `r` is a list as defined previously,
- `a` is the first integer from the input,
- `x` is the second integer from the input,
- If `a` is 1, then `ax` is `x`, `bx` is `x`, and `cx` is an empty set.
- If `a` is not 1, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we only need to adjust `n` because `_` is not relevant to the loop continuation condition.

Since the loop iterates `n` times, at the start of each iteration, `n` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the remaining iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` remains the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 500),
- `n` is decremented by 1 (n > 0),
- `r`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged,
- `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` remain unchanged based on the value of `a` and `x`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `r` is a list as defined previously, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `ax` is `x` if `a` is 1, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is `x` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1 if `a` is 2, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`**.

Simplified:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is decremented by 1, `r` is a list as defined previously, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are calculated based on the value of `a` and `x` as described**.
