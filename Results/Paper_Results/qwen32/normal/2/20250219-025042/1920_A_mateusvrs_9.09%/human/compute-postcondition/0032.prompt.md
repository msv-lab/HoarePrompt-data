Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the input integer between 2 and 100, `r` is an empty list, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is max(x, -1). If `a` is 2, then `ax` is min(x, 1000000007). If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, then `cx` is a set containing `x`. Otherwise, `bx` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` equals 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and 0, and `r` remains an empty list. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`, and `r` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007, and `r` is a list containing the single element `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 1 and 99, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007; otherwise, `ax` is 1000000007. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `r` is a list containing the single element `x`; otherwise, `r` remains an empty list. Additionally, if `a` is not 2, `cx` includes the value of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
