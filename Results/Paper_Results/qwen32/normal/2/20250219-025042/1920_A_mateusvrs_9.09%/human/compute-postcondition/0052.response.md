The code snippet `cx = set()` initializes the variable `cx` as an empty set. This means that any previous contents of `cx` are discarded, and it starts fresh as an empty set. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the integer input by the user, `ax` is the smallest `x` encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest `x` encountered when `a` was 1, `cx` is an empty set, and `r` is a list as defined previously.**
