Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, and `a` is not equal to 1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
