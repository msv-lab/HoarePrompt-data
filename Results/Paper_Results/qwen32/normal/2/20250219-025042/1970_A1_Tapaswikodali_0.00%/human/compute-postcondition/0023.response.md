To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet provided:

### Initial State:
- `s`: A non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
- `balance`: Initialized to 0.
- `details`: A list containing tuples `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in `s`, sorted in ascending order by `balance` and in descending order by `i` for tuples with the same `balance`.
- `result`: A string equal to `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `result` is explicitly stated to be equal to the string `s`.
- Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, it means every opening parenthesis "(" has a corresponding closing parenthesis ")" in the correct order.
- The `print(result)` statement will output the value of `result`, which is the same as the value of `s`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(result)` statement will print the original string `s` which is a balanced parentheses sequence.

### Final Output:
Output: **s (where s is a balanced parentheses sequence)**

However, since the exact content of `s` is not specified, the most precise description we can give is that it will print the original string `s` as it is.

Thus, the final output format is:
Output: **s**
