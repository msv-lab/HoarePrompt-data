To determine the final state after the loop has executed all iterations, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given information.

The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, which is a balanced parentheses sequence. This means that for every opening parenthesis '(', there is a corresponding closing parenthesis ')'. The variable `balance` keeps track of the net number of open parentheses encountered so far. It increases by 1 for each '(', and decreases by 1 for each ')'. The `details` list accumulates tuples containing the current `balance`, the negative index `-i`, and the current character `char`.

Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, by the end of the loop, the `balance` should be 0 because every opening parenthesis will have been matched with a closing parenthesis.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `s` remains the same as it was initially.
- `balance` will be 0 because the sequence is balanced.
- `details` will contain a tuple for each character in `s`, representing the `balance` at that point, the negative index, and the character itself.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `balance` is 0; `details` is a list containing tuples `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in `s`.**

In simpler terms, after processing all characters in the balanced parentheses string `s`, the `balance` will be zero, indicating that all opening parentheses have been matched with closing ones. The `details` list will have a record of the balance at each step along with the corresponding character and its negative index.
