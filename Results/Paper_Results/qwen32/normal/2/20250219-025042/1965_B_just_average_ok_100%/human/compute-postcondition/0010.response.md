The code snippet assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `idx` will be assigned the value `0`.

The conditions regarding `nums[i]` and `k` do not affect the assignment of `idx` in this snippet, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `i` is 1; `idx` is 0. If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, then `idx` is -2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx` remains -1.**
