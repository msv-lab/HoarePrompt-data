To determine the output of the `print(*nums)` statement, let's break down the problem step by step using the initial state provided:

1. **Initialization of `nums` List**:
   - `nums` starts with predefined powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
   - Additional elements are added based on the value of `k`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This is the difference between `k` and the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.
     - `k + 1`: This is simply `k` incremented by 1.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This is `k` plus the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, plus 1.
   - The element `2^idx` is removed from the list, where `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Determine `idx`**:
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If `k` is greater than 1048576, `idx` is set to 20.

3. **Constructing `nums`**:
   - Start with the predefined list of powers of 2.
   - Find `idx` based on `k`.
   - Remove `2^idx` from the list.
   - Append `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this process:

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `k = 500`.
- The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 500 is 256, which is at index 8 in the predefined list.
- Therefore, `idx = 8`.
- Remove `2^8 = 256` from the list.
- Add `500 - 256 = 244`, `500 + 1 = 501`, and `500 + 256 + 1 = 757` to the list.
- The resulting `nums` list would be: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 244, 501, 757]`.

### General Case:
Given the general nature of the problem, the output will depend on the specific value of `k`. However, the structure of the output can be described as follows:

- The list starts with the predefined powers of 2 up to 1048576.
- The largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` is removed.
- Three additional elements are appended: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

Thus, the output will be a list of these values.

### Final Output Description:
Output: **[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, k - nums[idx], k + 1, k + nums[idx] + 1] (where idx is the index of the largest power of 2 in nums that is less than or equal to k, and nums[idx] is removed from the list)**
