The given code snippet removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Here's the impact of the code on the program:

- `nums` initially contains a list of powers of 2 and some additional elements derived from `k`.
- `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if `k` is greater than 1048576.
- The element at `nums[idx]` is removed from the list.

Since `nums[idx]` is `1 << idx` (which is `2^idx`), this element will be removed from the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`] with `1 << idx` removed; `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if `k` is greater than 1048576.**

In simpler terms, the list `nums` no longer contains the element `2^idx`, which was the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
