The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. Since the loop iterates over the range of the length of `nums`, `i` should be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next iteration.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.

No other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `idx`) need to be adjusted as per the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `i` is 2. If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, then `idx` is -2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx` remains -1.**
