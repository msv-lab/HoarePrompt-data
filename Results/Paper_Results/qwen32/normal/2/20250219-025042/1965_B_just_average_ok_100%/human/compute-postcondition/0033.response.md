To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains the variable `i` and the length of the list `nums`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over the indices of the list `nums`. The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

### Current State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input
- `nums` is a list containing specific powers of 2
- `idx` is -1
- `i` is 0

### Adjustment for Next Iteration:
Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

No other variables in the loop head (`nums`) need adjustment because it is a constant list and its length does not change.

### Conclusion:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is -1, `i` is 1**
