Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `idx`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
