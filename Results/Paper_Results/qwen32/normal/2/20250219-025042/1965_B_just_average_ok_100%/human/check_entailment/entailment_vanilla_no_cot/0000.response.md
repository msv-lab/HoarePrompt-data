To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it against the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We need a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
2. There must be no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
3. For every integer `v` in the range `[1, n]` except `k`, there must be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Initialization of `nums`:**
   ```python
   nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
   ```
   This creates a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). This list has 21 elements and can generate all sums from 1 to \(2^{21} - 1\) using different combinations of its elements.

2. **Finding the Index:**
   ```python
   idx = -1
   for i in range(len(nums)):
       if nums[i] > k:
           idx = i - 1
           break
   ```
   This loop finds the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to 1, `idx` will remain -1, which is an edge case not handled properly.

3. **Modifying `nums`:**
   ```python
   nums.append(k - nums[idx])
   nums.append(k + 1)
   nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
   nums.remove(1 << idx)
   ```
   - `k - nums[idx]` is added to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are added to ensure that sums greater than `k` can still be formed.
   - `1 << idx` (which is `nums[idx]`) is removed to prevent forming the sum `k`.

4. **Output:**
   ```python
   print(len(nums))
   print(*nums)
   ```
   The length of the modified `nums` list and its elements are printed.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle cases where `k` is very small (e.g., `k = 1`). In such cases, the logic might fail because `idx` remains -1, leading to errors when trying to access `nums[idx]`.
- **General Case Handling:** The program assumes that the initial set of powers of 2 can cover all sums up to `n`. However, this is not guaranteed for all values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, if `k` is large relative to the initial set of powers of 2, additional elements may be needed to ensure all sums up to `n` can be formed while avoiding `k`.
- **Complexity and Size Constraint:** While the program aims to keep the sequence size at most 25, the modifications might sometimes exceed this limit depending on the values of `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential issues with edge cases and the possibility of exceeding the size constraint, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all valid inputs within the problem constraints.

**Correctness: False**
