The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `idx` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `i` is 1. If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, then `idx` is -2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx` remains -1.**
