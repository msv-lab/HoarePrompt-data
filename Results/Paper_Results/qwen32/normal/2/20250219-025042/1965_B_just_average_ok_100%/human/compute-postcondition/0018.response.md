The code appends the difference between `k` and the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k` to the `nums` list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `idx` also remains unchanged because the operation does not affect the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`]; `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`, or -1 if `k` is greater than 1048576.**
