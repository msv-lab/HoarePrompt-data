The code `t -= 1` modifies the value of the variable `t`. Initially, `t` is `True`, which is equivalent to `1` in a numerical context. Subtracting `1` from `1` results in `0`, which is equivalent to `False`.

Thus, the variable `t` changes from `True` to `False`. The list and the variable `u` remain unchanged.

Output State: **[0, 0, S_1, S_1, S_2, S_2, ..., S_{n-2}, S_{n-2}]; u is 0; t is False**
