You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9. m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each of the m queries, there are two integers x_i and y_i such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of city coordinates and a set of queries.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. Specifically, the program does not handle the closest city logic correctly and does not compute the minimum cost to travel between cities based on the rules provided.

Here are some issues with the code:
1. The program incorrectly calculates the closest city and the associated costs. It uses a complex formula involving powers and sums, which does not align with the problem's requirement to find the closest city and travel to it for 1 coin.
2. The program does not correctly handle the logic of traveling between cities using the closest city shortcut or directly paying the distance cost.
3. The program does not correctly process the input and output the results for each query.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

Expected Output:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the provided program does not produce these outputs correctly. Let's break down why:

- For the query `1 4`, the correct path is to go from city 1 to city 2 (1 coin), then from city 2 to city 3 (1 coin), then from city 3 to city 4 (1 coin), totaling 3 coins.
- For the query `1 5`, the correct path is to go from city 1 to city 2 (1 coin), then from city 2 to city 3 (1 coin), then from city 3 to city 4 (1 coin), then from city 4 to city 5 (5 coins), totaling 8 coins.
- For the query `3 4`, the correct path is to go from city 3 to city 4 (1 coin), totaling 1 coin.
- For the query `3 2`, the correct path is to go from city 3 to city 2 (1 coin), totaling 1 coin.
- For the query `5 1`, the correct path is to go from city 5 to city 4 (1 coin), then from city 4 to city 3 (1 coin), then from city 3 to city 2 (1 coin), then from city 2 to city 1 (8 coins), totaling 14 coins.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and fails to meet the problem's requirements.
