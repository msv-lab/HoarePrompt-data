The code snippet assigns the values returned by the function `r()` to the variables `c` and `d`. Since the specific values returned by `r()` are not provided, we can only denote them as `c` and `d` respectively. The initial list and the value of `u` remain unchanged.

Output State: **[0, 0, S_1, S_1, S_2, S_2, ..., S_{n-2}, S_{n-2}]; `u` is False; `c` is the first value returned by `r()`, `d` is the second value returned by `r()`**.
