Output State: **[0, 0, S_1, S_1, S_2, S_2, ..., S_{n-2}, S_{n-2}]; u is 0; t is False; r() has been called; a is (-1000000000.0, r_result, 2000000000.0, additional_element); b is [0, 0, (v if v > x - w else 1), (v if v > z - y else 1)]; v is y - x.**

Explanation: The value of `v` is recalculated to be `y - x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
