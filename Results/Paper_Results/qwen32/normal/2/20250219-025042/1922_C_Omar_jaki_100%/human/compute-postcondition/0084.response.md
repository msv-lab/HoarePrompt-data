To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. These variables are derived from the tuple `a` using the `zip` function.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is `(-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0, value1, value2)`
- `t` is decreased by 1
- `r_result` is less than 500000000.0
- `b` is `[0, 0, v if v > x - w else 1, v if v > z - y else 1]`
- The list provided before the loop is `[0, 0, (2000000000.0 - r_result if 2000000000.0 - r_result > r_result + 1000000000.0 else 1), (2000000000.0 - r_result if 2000000000.0 - r_result > additional_element - 2000000000.0 else 1)]`
- `v` is `y - x`

Let's analyze the loop:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```
In the first iteration, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned as follows:
- `w` is `a[0]` which is `-1000000000.0`
- `x` is `a[1]` which is `2000000000.0`
- `y` is `a[2]` which is `value1`
- `z` is `a[3]` which is `value2`

After this iteration, the loop would try to assign the next set of values:
- `w` would be `a[1]` which is `2000000000.0`
- `x` would be `a[2]` which is `value1`
- `y` would be `a[3]` which is `value2`
- `z` would be `a[4]` which does not exist since `a` only has 4 elements.

Since `a` only has 4 elements, the loop will terminate after the first iteration because there are no more elements to form the tuple `(w, x, y, z)`.

Therefore, there is no next iteration to adjust the state for. However, if we were to hypothetically consider the state right before the loop terminates, it would be:

State: **`a` is `(-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0, value1, value2)`, `t` is decreased by 1, `r_result` is less than 500000000.0, `b` is `[0, 0, v if v > x - w else 1, v if v > z - y else 1]`, the list provided before the loop is `[0, 0, (2000000000.0 - r_result if 2000000000.0 - r_result > r_result + 1000000000.0 else 1), (2000000000.0 - r_result if 2000000000.0 - r_result > additional_element - 2000000000.0 else 1)]`, `v` is `y - x`, `w` is `2000000000.0`, `x` is `value1`, `y` is `value2`, `z` does not exist**.

But since `z` does not exist, the loop terminates. Therefore, the final state before termination is:

State: **`a` is `(-1000000000.0, 2000000000.0, value1, value2)`, `t` is decreased by 1, `r_result` is less than 500000000.0, `b` is `[0, 0, v if v > x - w else 1, v if v > z - y else 1]`, the list provided before the loop is `[0, 0, (2000000000.0 - r_result if 2000000000.0 - r_result > r_result + 1000000000.0 else 1), (2000000000.0 - r_result if 2000000000.0 - r_result > additional_element - 2000000000.0 else 1)]`, `v` is `y - x`, `w` is `2000000000.0`, `x` is `value1`, `y` is `value2`**.
