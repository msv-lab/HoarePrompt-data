The given code snippet reassigns the values of `c` and `d` to the values returned by the function `r()`. This means that the previous values of `c` and `d` are overwritten with the new values from the function call.

Since the initial state specifies that `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`, and the code reassigns them to the same function call, the values of `c` and `d` remain the same as they were initially described. The condition `c < d` holds true if `c` is less than `d`, and it does not hold true otherwise.

Output State: **`u` is at least 0, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then the condition `c < d` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `c < d` does not hold true.**
