The function `r()` returns a tuple of two truthy values, which are then unpacked into the variables `c` and `d`. The initial state of `u` being a truthy value decremented by 1 does not affect the execution of this line of code, so its state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`u` is a truthy value decremented by 1, `c` is a truthy value, `d` is a truthy value**.
