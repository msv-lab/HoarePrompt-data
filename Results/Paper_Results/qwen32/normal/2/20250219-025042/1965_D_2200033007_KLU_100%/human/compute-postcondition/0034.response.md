The code snippet `sm = sm + a[j]` updates the value of `sm` by adding the element at index `j` of the list `a` to its current value. Given that `j` is 4, `sm` is updated to `sm + a[4]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `sm` is `sm + a[3] + a[4]`, `cts` has an additional element which is the value of `sm - a[4]`**

Natural Language: The list `a` remains a list of positive integers with at least 3 elements. The variable `i` remains 2, and `j` remains 4. The variable `sm` is now the sum of its previous value plus the element at index 4 of the list `a`. The list `cts` has an additional element, which is the value of `sm` before it was updated with `a[4]`.
