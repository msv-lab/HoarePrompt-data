Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to verify its correctness.

### Problem Recap
We need to reconstruct a palindrome array `a` of size `n` from the given sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays. The program consists of four functions, and we need to ensure that these functions collectively solve the problem correctly.

### Function Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1(a)`
- **Purpose**: Generate all subarray sums of the array `a` and return them sorted.
- **Implementation**: Iterates through each starting point `i` and calculates the cumulative sum up to each endpoint `j`, appending each sum to the list `cts`.
- **Summary**: Correctly generates all subarray sums.

#### Function 2: `func_2(cts)`
- **Purpose**: Identify the unique subarray sums from the list `cts`.
- **Implementation**: Uses a stack-like approach where if the current sum is the same as the last element in the `odds` list, it pops the last element; otherwise, it appends the current sum.
- **Summary**: Correctly identifies the unique subarray sums by removing pairs of identical sums.

#### Function 3: `func_3(odds, n)`
- **Purpose**: Reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums `odds`.
- **Implementation**: Initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros. Iterates through the `odds` list, filling in the values of `a` based on the differences between consecutive sums in `odds`. Handles the middle element separately if `n` is odd.
- **Summary**: Correctly reconstructs the palindrome array by leveraging the properties of palindromes and the differences between consecutive unique sums.

#### Function 4: `func_4(bigList, smallList)`
- **Purpose**: Find the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of all subarray sums (`bigList`) with the list of given subarray sums (`smallList`).
- **Implementation**: Removes common elements from the end of both lists and returns the last element of `bigList`.
- **Summary**: Correctly identifies the missing subarray sum.

### Overall Process
1. **Generate All Subarray Sums**: `func_1(a)` generates all subarray sums of the unknown palindrome `a`.
2. **Identify Unique Sums**: `func_2(cts)` identifies the unique subarray sums.
3. **Reconstruct the Palindrome**: `func_3(odds, n)` reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
4. **Find Missing Sum**: `func_4(bigList, smallList)` finds the missing subarray sum, although this step is not directly used in the reconstruction process.

### Key Points to Verify
1. **Generating Subarray Sums**: `func_1` correctly generates all subarray sums.
2. **Identifying Unique Sums**: `func_2` correctly identifies the unique subarray sums.
3. **Reconstructing the Palindrome**: `func_3` correctly reconstructs the palindrome array.

### Verification
- **Generating Subarray Sums**: `func_1` is straightforward and correctly implemented.
- **Identifying Unique Sums**: `func_2` uses a stack-like approach to remove pairs of identical sums, ensuring that only unique sums remain.
- **Reconstructing the Palindrome**: `func_3` correctly fills in the values of `a` based on the differences between consecutive sums in `odds`. The handling of the middle element for odd-sized arrays is also correct.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the necessary steps to solve the problem. Given that the problem guarantees there is always at least one valid solution and the constraints are respected, the provided program should correctly reconstruct the palindrome array for each test case.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
