The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. Given that `cnt` was initially `k`, after the operation `cnt` becomes `k - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.
