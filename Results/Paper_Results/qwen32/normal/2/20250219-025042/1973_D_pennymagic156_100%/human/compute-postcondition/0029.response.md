To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`.
- `cnt` is `k - 1`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `l`:**
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`.
   - Since `func_2()` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `l` will be whatever `func_2()` returns plus 1.

2. **Variable `i`:**
   - The variable `i` is not mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, we do not have any information about its value.

3. **Variable `v`:**
   - Similarly, the variable `v` is not mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, we do not have any information about its value.

4. **Expression `i * v`:**
   - Since both `i` and `v` are unknown, the expression `i * v` also remains unknown.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific values for `i`, `v`, and the function `func_2()`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [func_2() + 1] [i * v] (where func_2() is the return value of the function func_2(), i is an unknown integer, and v is an unknown integer)**
