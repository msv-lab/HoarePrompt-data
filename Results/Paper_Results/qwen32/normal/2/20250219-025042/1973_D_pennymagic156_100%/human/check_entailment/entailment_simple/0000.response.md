### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by making strategic queries to determine the largest possible value \( m \) such that the array can be split into exactly \( k \) subarrays, where each subarray satisfies the condition \( f(l, r) = m \).

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \) using `func_3()`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Possible Value \( m \):**
   - The program iterates from \( n \) down to 1, making a query for \( f(1, i \cdot n) \). This is done to find the largest possible value \( m \) that could be a candidate for the answer.
   - The query `print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)` asks for the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(1, r) = i \cdot n \).
   - If the response \( v \) is equal to \( n \), it means that the entire array could potentially be a subarray with value \( i \cdot n \). In this case, \( v \) is set to \( i \) and the loop breaks.

3. **Verifying the Candidate Value \( m \):**
   - After finding a potential candidate \( m = i \cdot v \), the program attempts to verify if the array can be split into exactly \( k \) subarrays, each with value \( m \).
   - It initializes `cnt` to \( k \) and `l` to 1, indicating that it needs to find \( k \) subarrays starting from index 1.
   - The program makes a series of queries `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)` to find the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = i \cdot v \).
   - If a valid \( r \) is found, it updates `l` to \( r + 1 \) and decrements `cnt`.
   - If `cnt` reaches 0 and `l` is equal to \( n + 1 \), it means the array can be successfully split into \( k \) subarrays, each with value \( m \). The program prints `! {i * v}` and exits the current test case.

4. **Handling the Case Where No Valid Split Exists:**
   - If the program cannot find a valid split after trying all possible candidates, it prints `! -1`.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- The program correctly identifies the largest possible value \( m \) by starting from the highest possible value and working downwards.
- It verifies the candidate value \( m \) by attempting to split the array into \( k \) subarrays, each with value \( m \).
- If no valid split is found, it correctly outputs `-1`.

However, there are some potential issues:
- The program assumes that the largest possible value \( m \) is found by iterating from \( n \) down to 1 and checking \( f(1, i \cdot n) \). This assumption may not always hold true, especially if the maximum value in the array is not \( n \).
- The verification step might not cover all edge cases, particularly when the array contains repeated values or when the optimal split involves subarrays of varying lengths.

Given the complexity of the problem and the need for precise queries, the program seems to follow a logical approach but may not handle all edge cases perfectly.

### Conclusion:

While the program appears to follow a logical approach, there are potential edge cases that it may not handle correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the provided code and reasoning is not guaranteed for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**
