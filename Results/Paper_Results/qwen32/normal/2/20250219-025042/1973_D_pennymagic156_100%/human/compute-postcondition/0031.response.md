The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. Given that `cnt` was initially `k - 1`, after decrementing, `cnt` becomes `k - 2`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.
