The given code snippet assigns new values to the variables `cnt` and `l`. Specifically, `cnt` is set to the value of `k`, and `l` is set to `1`.

Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be `>= n + 1` if the loop terminated early, and `i` is `3`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `cnt` is updated to the value of `k`.
- `l` is updated to `1`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `v`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k`, `l` is `1`, `i` is `3`.**
