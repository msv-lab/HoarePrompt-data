### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its behavior against the problem requirements.

#### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Objective**: Find the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into exactly \( k \) subarrays where each subarray satisfies \( f(l, r) = m \).
2. **Interactive Queries**: We can ask up to \( 2n \) queries of the form `? l x` to find the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = x \) or \( n+1 \) if no such \( r \) exists.
3. **Constraints**: \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `func_5` starts by reading \( n \) and \( k \) using `func_3`.
   - It initializes `v` to 1.

2. **Finding Maximum Possible Value**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n, 0, -1)` attempts to find the maximum possible value \( v \) such that \( f(1, n) = i \cdot n \). This is done by querying `? 1 {i * n}`.
   - If the response `v` is \( n \), it means \( f(1, n) = i \cdot n \) is valid, and `v` is set to \( i \) and the loop breaks.

3. **Checking Validity of Split**:
   - The outer loop `for i in range(1, n // k + 1)` iterates through potential values of \( m \) starting from the largest possible down to smaller values.
   - For each potential \( m = i \cdot v \), it tries to split the array into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray satisfies \( f(l, r) = m \).
   - The inner `while` loop `while cnt and l < n + 1` performs the splitting:
     - It queries `? {l} {i * v}` to find the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = m \).
     - It updates `l` to `r + 1` and decrements `cnt` (which counts the number of remaining subarrays needed).
     - If `cnt` reaches 0 and `l` reaches \( n + 1 \), it means the array can be successfully split into \( k \) subarrays with each having \( f(l, r) = m \), and it prints `! {i * v}` and exits.
   
4. **Failure Case**:
   - If no valid \( m \) is found after all iterations, it prints `! -1`.

#### Evaluation:
- The approach seems logically sound. It starts with the largest possible value and checks downwards, ensuring that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays with the same \( f(l, r) \) value.
- The number of queries is within the limit of \( 2n \) since it performs at most \( n \) queries in the first loop and at most \( n \) queries per iteration of the outer loop, which runs up to \( n // k \) times.
- The code handles the interaction correctly by flushing the output after each query and answer.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly solve the problem according to the given specifications.

**Correctness: True**
