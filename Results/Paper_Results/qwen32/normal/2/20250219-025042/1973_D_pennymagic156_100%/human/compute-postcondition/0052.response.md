To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables `cnt` and `l` as they are the ones mentioned in the loop condition.

The loop condition is `while cnt and l < n + 1:`. This means that for the loop to execute again, both `cnt` must be truthy (non-zero) and `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given the current state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).
- `cnt` is `k - 2`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`.
- `i` is `2`.

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **`cnt` Condition**: 
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`. For `cnt` to be truthy, `k - 2` must be greater than 0, which means `k > 2`. Since `k` is already given to be between `1` and `n`, we need to ensure that `k` is at least `3` for `cnt` to be non-zero.

2. **`l` Condition**:
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`. Since `l` is already defined as `func_2() + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`, we need to ensure that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `func_2() < n`. Given that `l` is already defined with this constraint, no further adjustment is needed for `l` itself, but we need to ensure that `func_2()` returns a value that satisfies this condition.

Since `l` is already defined with the necessary constraint and `cnt` just needs `k` to be at least `3` to be non-zero, the only state we need to adjust is `k` to ensure `cnt` remains truthy.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `3 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`, `i` is `2`**.
