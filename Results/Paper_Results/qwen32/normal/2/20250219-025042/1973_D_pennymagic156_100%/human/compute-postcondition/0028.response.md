To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The `while` loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.

- `cnt` is a boolean that evaluates to `True` if `cnt` is non-zero.
- `l < n + 1` is a comparison that checks if `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).
- `cnt` is `k - 1`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

Let's break down the requirements for the loop to execute one more time:

1. **`cnt` should be non-zero**: Since `cnt` is `k - 1`, `k` must be greater than 1 to ensure `cnt` is non-zero.
2. **`l < n + 1` should hold true**: Given `l` is `func_2() + 1`, we need `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `func_2() < n`.

Since `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration, we need to ensure `v < n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` should be greater than 1 to ensure `cnt` is non-zero.
- `v` (the value returned by `func_2()`) should be less than `n` to ensure `l < n + 1`.

However, since `v` is the result of `func_2()` and we cannot directly control its value, we can only ensure `k > 1` and that `l` is set appropriately based on the condition.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l < n + 1`**

But since we can't directly control `v`, we focus on ensuring `k > 1` and `l < n + 1`:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l < n + 1`**

For simplicity and adherence to the given constraints, we can state:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `l < n + 1`**

Since `l` is derived from `func_2() + 1`, we ensure `l < n + 1` indirectly by ensuring `k > 1` and the condition holds true for `l`.

Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**
