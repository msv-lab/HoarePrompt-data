To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `3 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).
- `cnt` is `k - 2`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`.
- `i` is `2`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Let's analyze the components of the print statement:

1. **`l`**: According to the initial state, `l` is `func_2() + 1`. Since `func_2()` is called during the last iteration (`i = 1`), we need to know the return value of `func_2()` from that iteration. However, since the exact return value of `func_2()` is not specified, we'll denote it as `func_2_value`. Therefore, `l` is `func_2_value + 1`.

2. **`i * v`**: Here, `i` is explicitly given as `2`, and `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`). So, `i * v` translates to `2 * func_2_value`.

Given this, the print statement will output:
```
? func_2_value + 1 2 * func_2_value
```

Where `func_2_value` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).

Thus, the final output is described as follows:
Output: **? [func_2_value + 1] [2 * func_2_value] (where func_2_value is the value returned by func_2() during the last iteration (i = 1))**
