To determine the output state, we need to consider the given code snippet and how it affects the variables:

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`, `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

The code snippet is:
```python
l = func_2() + 1
```

This line of code updates the value of `l`. The new value of `l` is determined by the return value of `func_2()` plus 1. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine its exact return value. However, we can express the new value of `l` in terms of the return value of `func_2()`.

Let's denote the return value of `func_2()` as `r`. Therefore, the new value of `l` is `r + 1`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`, `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.
