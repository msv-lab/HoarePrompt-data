To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`).
- `cnt` is `0`.
- `l` is `n + 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is not explicitly mentioned, but since it is used in the print statement, we need to infer its value. Given the context, `i` is likely a loop counter, and since it is mentioned in the context of the last iteration where `i = 1`, we can assume `i` is `1` for this print statement.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration where `i = 1`. Since the exact value of `v` is not provided, we will represent it as `v`.

Given these assumptions, the expression `i * v` simplifies to `1 * v`, which is just `v`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **! v (where v is the value returned by func_2() during the last iteration where i = 1)**
