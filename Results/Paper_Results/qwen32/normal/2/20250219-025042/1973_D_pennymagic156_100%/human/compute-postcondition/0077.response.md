Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3 * k`, `k` is an integer such that `k <= n`, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`), `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `n + 1` from the last iteration, `i` is `3`. Additionally, `cnt` is `0` and `l` is equal to `n + 1`.**
