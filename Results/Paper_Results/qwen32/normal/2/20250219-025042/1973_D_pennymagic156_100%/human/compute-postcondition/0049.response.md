To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` during the last iteration (`i = 1`). Note that the specific value of `v` is not explicitly provided, so we'll represent it as `v`.
- `cnt` is `k - 1`.
- `l` must be less than `n + 1`.
- `i` is `2`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Let's analyze the components of the string that will be printed:
- `?` is a literal character.
- `{l}` will be replaced by the current value of `l`.
- `{i * v}` will be replaced by the product of `i` and `v`.

Given that `i` is `2`, the expression `i * v` simplifies to `2 * v`.

Thus, the final output string will be:
- `?` followed by the value of `l`,
- followed by a space,
- followed by the value of `2 * v`.

Since the exact values of `l` and `v` are not specified, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [l] [2 * v] (where l is a value less than n + 1 and v is the value returned by func_2() during the last iteration (i = 1))**
