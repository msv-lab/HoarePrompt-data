To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the variables involved:

- `n`: A positive integer.
- `k`: An integer such that `2 <= k <= n`.
- `cnt`: Must be non-zero (though `cnt` is not used in the print statement).
- `l`: Must be less than `n + 1`.
- `i`: Not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it is defined somewhere in the code prior to this print statement.
- `v`: Not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it is defined somewhere in the code prior to this print statement.

Given these assumptions, the print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown of the print statement:
- The string starts with a literal `'?'`.
- `{l}` is replaced by the value of the variable `l`.
- `{i * v}` is replaced by the result of the expression `i * v`.

Since `l`, `i`, and `v` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot provide their exact numerical values. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? [l] [i * v] (where l is an integer less than n + 1, i is an integer, and v is an integer)**
