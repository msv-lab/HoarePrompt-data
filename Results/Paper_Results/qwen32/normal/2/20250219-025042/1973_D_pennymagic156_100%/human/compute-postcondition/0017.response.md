The code snippet assigns the value returned by `func_2()` to the variable `v`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement (if `v` equals `n`) is not evaluated yet, as `func_2()` has just been called and its return value assigned to `v`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `i` is 3, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`.**
