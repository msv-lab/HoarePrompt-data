To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```
while cnt and l < n + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue as long as both conditions are true:
1. `cnt` is non-zero (i.e., `cnt` is truthy).
2. `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`.
- `cnt` is `k - 2`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is initially set to `k - 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `cnt` must be non-zero.
   - Since `2 <= k <= n`, `cnt` can range from `0` to `n - 2`.
   - If `cnt` is `0` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, `cnt` should be adjusted to a non-zero value.

2. **Condition `l < n + 1`:**
   - `l` is set to `func_2() + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer, `n + 1` is always greater than `1`.
   - The value of `l` depends on the return value of `func_2()`. To ensure `l < n + 1`, `func_2()` should return a value such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `func_2() < n`.
   - Given that `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` should be adjusted to a value less than `n + 1`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `cnt` to a non-zero value and ensure `l` is less than `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n`, `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` must be less than `n + 1`**
