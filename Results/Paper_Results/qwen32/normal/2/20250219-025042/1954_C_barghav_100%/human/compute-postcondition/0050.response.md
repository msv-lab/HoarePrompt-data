To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

- `a` is a list, but it is not used in the print statement, so its contents do not affect the output.
- `b` is a list with at least one element.
- `i` is an index that has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, and this new value of `i` must be less than the length of `b`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print(b[i], end='')` will print the element of the list `b` at the current index `i`. The `end=''` argument ensures that there is no newline character added after printing the element, meaning the next print (if any) will continue on the same line.

Since the exact value of `i` and the contents of `b` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. The output will be the element at index `i` of the list `b`.

Output: **b[i] (where b[i] is the element at index i of the list b)**
