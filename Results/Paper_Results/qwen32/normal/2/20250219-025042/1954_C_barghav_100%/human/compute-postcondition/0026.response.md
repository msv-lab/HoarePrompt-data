Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same number of digits; `a` is a list of characters representing the digits of `x` and `b` is a list of characters representing the digits of `y`. If `a[i] < b[i]`, the digits at index `i` in `a` and `b` are swapped, and `f` is set to 1. If `a[i] > b[i]`, the digits at index `i` in `a` and `b` are swapped, and `f` is set to 1. If `a[i] == b[i]`, no swap occurs. In all cases, `i` is incremented by 1.**
