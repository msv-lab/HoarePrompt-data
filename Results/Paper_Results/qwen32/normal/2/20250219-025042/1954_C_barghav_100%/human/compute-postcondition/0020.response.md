Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `x` and `y` have the same number of digits; `a` is a list of characters representing the digits of the input number `x` with the digit at index `i` swapped with the digit at index `i` in `b`; `b` is a list of characters representing the digits of the newly input number `y` with the digit at index `i` swapped with the digit at index `i` in `a`; `i` is incremented by 1; `f` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `f` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.
