To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the code step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list with at least one element.
- The variable `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we need to consider the implications of this absence.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: Since `a` is a list with at least one element, it could contain any type of elements (integers, strings, etc.). However, without specific values, we can only refer to the elements in general terms.
   
2. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is used as an index to access an element from the list `a`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we need to consider the possible scenarios:
   - If `i` is within the valid range of indices for the list `a` (i.e., `0 <= i < len(a)`), then `a[i]` will be a valid element of the list.
   - If `i` is out of the valid range, it would raise an `IndexError`.

Given that the problem does not specify the value of `i`, we must assume that `i` is a valid index within the bounds of the list `a` to avoid runtime errors.

### Conclusion:
- The code will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` without appending a newline character at the end due to `end=''`.

### Final Output Description:
Output: **a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i of the list a)**
