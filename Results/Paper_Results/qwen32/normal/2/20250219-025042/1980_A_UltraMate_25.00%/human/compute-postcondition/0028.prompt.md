Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the string from the input, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`, and `ans` is `m * k` where `k` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the string from the input and must contain at least one character, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s` and must have at least one key-value pair. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is `m * k + (m - hmp[i])`; otherwise, `ans` remains `m * k`, where `k` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the string from the input and must contain at least one character, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s` and must have at least one key-value pair. `i` is the next key in `hmp` after the current one. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is `m * k + (m - hmp[i])`; otherwise, `ans` remains `m * k`, where `k` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`. If `hmp[i] < m`, the new value of `ans` is the old value of `ans` plus `m - hmp[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the string from the input and must contain at least one character, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s` and must have at least one key-value pair, `i` is `i_next`. If `hmp[i] < m`, `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
