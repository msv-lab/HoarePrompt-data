The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This means the values of `n` and `m` will be updated based on the new input. All other variables (`a`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` remains unchanged, `s` is the input string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`, `t` is incremented by 1.**
