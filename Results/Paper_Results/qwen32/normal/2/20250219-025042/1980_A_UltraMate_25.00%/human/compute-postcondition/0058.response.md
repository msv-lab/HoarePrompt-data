To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to break down the calculation of `ans` based on the given initial state.

### Given Information:
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `a` remains unchanged (not used in the calculation of `ans`).
- `s` is the input string.
- `p` is the string `'ABCDEF'` (not used in the calculation of `ans`).
- `hmp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each character in `s`.
- `t` has been decremented by 1 (not used in the calculation of `ans`).
- `ans` is calculated as `6 * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`.

### Calculation of `ans`:

1. **First Term**: `6 * m`
   - This term is straightforward; it is simply six times the value of `m`.

2. **Second Term**: `sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`
   - This term involves iterating over each character `i` in the `hmp` counter.
   - For each character `i`, if its count `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, the expression `m - hmp[i]` is computed and added to the sum.
   - Essentially, this term calculates the total difference between `m` and the counts of characters in `s` that have counts less than `m`.

### Putting It All Together:
- The value of `ans` is the sum of the first term (`6 * m`) and the second term (the sum of differences).

### Final Output:
Given the above breakdown, the output of `print(ans)` will be the calculated value of `ans` based on the values of `m` and the character frequencies in the string `s`.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as 6 * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m))**
