The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the state of other variables within the loop. The loop will execute `t` times, and since `_` is not used within the loop body, its value does not need to be adjusted based on any internal state changes.

Given that `t` determines how many times the loop will run, and since `_` is just an iteration counter, the state of `_` at the start of each iteration is irrelevant to the other variables. The loop will simply decrement `t` by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same except for the implicit decrement of the loop counter `t`.

State: **`ans` is `m * k + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`, where `k` is the number of characters in `p` not in `hmp`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`) remain unchanged.** 

However, to reflect the start of the next iteration, we acknowledge that `t` will be decremented by 1:

State: **`ans` is `m * k + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`, where `k` is the number of characters in `p` not in `hmp`. `t` is decremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`) remain unchanged.**
