Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the string from the input and must contain at least one character, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s` and must have at least one key-value pair, `i` is `i_next`. If `hmp[i] < m`, `ans` is updated to `ans + m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
