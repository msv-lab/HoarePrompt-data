You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5. a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.

        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: t is 0, n and m are the values from the last iteration, s is the string from the last iteration, p is 'ABCDEF', hmp is the Counter object from the last iteration, and ans is the cumulative sum of ans values from all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only considers the difficulty levels 'A' through 'F' and ignores 'G'. This is evident from the line `p = 'ABCDEF'`, which excludes 'G' from the set of difficulty levels that need to be checked.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
1 1
G
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1
```

While this specific test case might seem to work, the program will fail for any test case involving the difficulty level 'G'. For example:

**Input:**
```
1
1 1
A
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1
```

However, if we include 'G':

**Input:**
```
1
1 1
G
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1
```

This is correct, but let's consider a more complex case:

**Input:**
```
1
6 1
ABCDFG
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1
```

However, if we consider:

**Input:**
```
1
7 1
ABCDEFG
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1
```

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs `1` because it does not account for the presence of 'G'. Therefore, the program is incorrect due to its failure to consider the full set of difficulty levels ('A' through 'G').

To fix this issue, the line `p = 'ABCDEF'` should be changed to `p = 'ABCDEFG'`.
