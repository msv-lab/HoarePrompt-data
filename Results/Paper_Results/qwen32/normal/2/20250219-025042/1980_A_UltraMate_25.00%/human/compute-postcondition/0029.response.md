To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to break down the expression used to calculate `ans`:

Given:
- `ans` is calculated as `m * k + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`
- `k` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`.

Let's analyze the components of this expression:

1. **`m * k`**: This part of the expression multiplies `m` by `k`. 
   - `m` is a given integer.
   - `k` is the count of characters in the string `p` that do not appear in the dictionary `hmp`.

2. **`sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`**: This part calculates the sum of differences between `m` and the values in `hmp` for keys that have values less than `m`.
   - For each key `i` in the dictionary `hmp`, if the value `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, it computes `m - hmp[i]`.
   - It then sums up all these computed differences.

Given that the exact values of `m`, `k`, `hmp`, and `p` are not specified, we can only describe the calculation process and the final result in terms of these variables.

Thus, the output will be described as follows:
Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as m * k + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m), with m being a given integer, k being the number of characters in p not in hmp, and hmp being a dictionary with integer values)**
