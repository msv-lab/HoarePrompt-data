Output State: **T is 1, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is the first integer read from the input, x is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 1, y is the third integer read from the input, list0 is a new sorted list of x distinct integers read from the input, num is 1, i is x - 2, count is 1**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
