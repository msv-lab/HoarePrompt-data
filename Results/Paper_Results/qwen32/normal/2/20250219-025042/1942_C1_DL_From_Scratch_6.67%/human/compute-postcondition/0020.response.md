The code calculates `num` as the difference between `n` and the last element of `list0`. Given that `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`, the last element of `list0` is the largest integer in `list0`.

Thus, `num` is calculated as `n - list0[-1]`.

Output State: **T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is the first integer read from the input, x is the integer read from the input such that x > 1, y is the third integer read from the input, list0 is a sorted list of x distinct integers provided in the second line of each test case, each ranging from 1 to n, count is 2, num is n - list0[-1].**
