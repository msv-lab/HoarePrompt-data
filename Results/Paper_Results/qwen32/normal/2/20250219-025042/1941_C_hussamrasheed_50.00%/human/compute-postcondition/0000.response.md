`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the code snippet. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 still holds.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
