To determine the output of the `print(m + p)` statement, let's break down the initial state and how the variables are defined:

1. **`t`**: This is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). It represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it does not directly affect the calculation of `m + p` for a single execution of the code snippet provided.

2. **`n`**: This is another input integer. Its value is not specified further, but it does not influence the calculation of `m + p` either.

3. **`s`**: This is a new input string from which all occurrences of the substring 'map' have been removed. The exact content of this string depends on the original input string and the removal of 'map'.

4. **`m`**: This is the number of times the substring 'map' appeared in the original `s`. The value of `m` is determined by counting how many times 'map' was present in the original string before any modifications were made.

5. **`p`**: This is the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the modified `s` (after all occurrences of 'map' have been removed).

6. **`i`**: This variable is mentioned as `i = i + 1`, but there is no context about its initial value or how it affects the calculation of `m + p`.

Given these definitions, the expression `m + p` represents the sum of the number of times 'map' appeared in the original string and the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string after removing all 'map' substrings.

Therefore, the output of the `print(m + p)` statement will be the sum of these two counts.

Output: **m + p (where m is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original string s, and p is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string s after removing all occurrences of 'map')**
