The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code will take a new integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `m`, `p`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `n`, which now holds the value of the new input integer. The other variables retain their original states and values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`, `i` is i + 1**.
