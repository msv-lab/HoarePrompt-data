The code snippet provided only affects the variable `n` by assigning it a new value from user input. None of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `m`, `p`, `i`) are modified by this code.

Given that `n` is reassigned to the value of the new input integer, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified `s`, `i` is i + 1**.
