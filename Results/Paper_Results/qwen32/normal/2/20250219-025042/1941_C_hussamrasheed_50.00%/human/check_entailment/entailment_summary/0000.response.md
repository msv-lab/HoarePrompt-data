### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the given string `s`. However, the logic used in the program is flawed.

Here's why:

1. **Counting Substrings**: The program correctly counts the number of times "map" appears in the string `s`.
2. **Removing Substrings**: It then removes all occurrences of "map" from the string.
3. **Counting Remaining "pie"**: After removing "map", it counts the number of times "pie" appears in the modified string.
4. **Summing Counts**: It sums the counts of "map" and "pie" and outputs this sum as the result.

However, the issue arises when considering overlapping substrings and the fact that removing one occurrence of "map" might create new occurrences of "pie" or vice versa. The program does not account for these potential new occurrences after removals.

For example, consider the string "mappie". Initially, it contains one "map" and one "pie". After removing "map", the string becomes "pie", which still contains one "pie". Therefore, the program would output 2, but the correct answer should be 1 because we can remove just the 'm' or the 'a' from "mappie" to make it beautiful.

Thus, the current approach does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
