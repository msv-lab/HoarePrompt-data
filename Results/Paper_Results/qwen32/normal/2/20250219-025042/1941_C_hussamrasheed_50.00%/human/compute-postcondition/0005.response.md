The code snippet `s = s.replace('map', '')` removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from the string `s`. This means that the value of `s` will change, while the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `m`, which initially represents the number of times 'map' appears in `s`, will no longer be accurate after the replacement operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`.**
