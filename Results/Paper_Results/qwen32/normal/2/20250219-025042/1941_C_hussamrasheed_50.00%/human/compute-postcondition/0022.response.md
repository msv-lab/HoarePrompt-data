To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables over each iteration.

### Loop Behavior Analysis:
- The loop runs `t` times.
- For each iteration:
  - It reads a new value for `n` (the length of the string `s`).
  - It reads a new string `s`.
  - It counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s` and assigns it to `m`.
  - It removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s`.
  - It counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified `s` and assigns it to `p`.
  - It prints the sum of `m` and `p`.

### Final Output State:
After all `t` iterations, the loop will have processed `t` different strings `s`. Each iteration is independent of the others except for the fact that they all follow the same pattern described above. Therefore, the final state of the variables at the end of the loop will be:

- `t`: This variable remains unchanged as it is the total number of iterations.
- `i`: This variable will be equal to `t` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`, so after the last iteration, `i` will be `t`.
- `n`, `s`, `m`, and `p`: These variables will reflect the values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically:
  - `n` will be the length of the string `s` read in the last iteration.
  - `s` will be the string from the last iteration with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
  - `m` will be the count of 'map' in the string `s` from the last iteration.
  - `p` will be the count of 'pie' in the modified string `s` from the last iteration.

However, since the question asks for the output state after all executions, and the output of the loop is the printed value of `m + p` for each iteration, the final output state does not need to include the intermediate values of `n`, `s`, `m`, and `p` from the last iteration. The key point is that the loop will have completed all `t` iterations.

### Conclusion:
The final output state of the loop after all iterations is simply that the loop has completed `t` iterations, and the variables `n`, `s`, `m`, and `p` will reflect the values from the last iteration, but these are not part of the final output state as per the problem statement.

Output State: **The loop has completed `t` iterations.**
