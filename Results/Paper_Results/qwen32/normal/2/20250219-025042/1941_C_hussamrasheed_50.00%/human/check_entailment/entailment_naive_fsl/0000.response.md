Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. The issue lies in how the program counts and removes occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".

Here's a breakdown of the problem:

1. The program counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" using `s.count('map')` and `s.count('pie')`.
2. It then removes all occurrences of "map" from the string using `s.replace('map', '')`.
3. After removal, it counts the occurrences of "pie" again and sums the counts of "map" and "pie" to get the result.

However, this approach is flawed because:
- Removing "map" might create new occurrences of "pie" that were not counted initially.
- Similarly, counting "pie" after removing "map" might miss some initial occurrences of "pie" that were part of longer sequences containing "map".
- The program does not consider overlapping substrings, which could lead to incorrect counts.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

**Example:**
Input:
```
1
10
mpimapie
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Explanation:
- The string "mpimapie" contains one "map" and one "pie".
- Removing "map" results in "mie", which still contains "pie".
- Therefore, we need to remove 2 characters (either 'm' from "map" or 'i' from "pie").

However, the program would output `2` for this case, but it might not handle more complex cases correctly due to the reasons mentioned above.

To fix the program, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that carefully tracks and removes the minimum number of characters to eliminate all occurrences of "map" and "pie".
