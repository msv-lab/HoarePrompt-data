The given code snippet modifies the variable `q` by dividing it by `gcd`. Since `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, this operation simplifies `q` to its reduced form relative to `p`.

Given the initial state, `q` is defined as `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, which simplifies to `n * (n - 1)`. After the division by `gcd`, the new value of `q` will be `q // gcd`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read in the `m` iterations, `j` is `2m - 1`, `a`, `b`, `f` are the values from the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd(p, q)`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
