To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
   - `i`: Initially set to 2.
   - `n`, `m`, `k`: These are integers read from the new input.
   - `sum_f`: This is the sum of all `f` values read during a loop.
   - `j`: Set to `m-1`.
   - `a`, `b`, `f`: These are values from the last iteration of a loop.
   - `cn2`: Calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `p`: Calculated as `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
   - `q`: Calculated as `2 * cn2 // gcd`.
   - `gcd`: The greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

2. **The print statement:**
   ```python
   print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
   ```

3. **Explanation of the print statement:**
   - `pow(q, -1, M)`: This computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `M`. It is the number `x` such that `(q * x) % M = 1`.
   - `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M`: This expression computes the result of `p` multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `M`, then takes the result modulo `M`.

Given the complexity of the calculations and the dependencies on the input values (`n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`), we cannot compute the exact numerical value without specific input values. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

**Output Description:**
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`, where:
- `p` is calculated as `(2 * k * n * (n - 1) // 2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
- `q` is calculated as `2 * n * (n - 1) // 2 // gcd`.
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
- `M` is assumed to be a predefined constant (not mentioned in the initial state, but typically used in modular arithmetic).

Therefore, the output is dependent on the specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, and `M`.

Output: **int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M) (where p and q are calculated based on n, m, k, sum_f, and gcd, and M is a predefined constant)**
