The given code calculates the number of combinations of `n` items taken 2 at a time, which is mathematically represented as `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This value is stored in the variable `cn2`.

Given the initial state, none of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`, `a`, `b`, `f`) are affected by this calculation.

Thus, the updated state includes the new value of `cn2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `j` is `m - 1`, `a` is the first integer from the last input, `b` is the second integer from the last input, `f` is the third integer from the last input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**
