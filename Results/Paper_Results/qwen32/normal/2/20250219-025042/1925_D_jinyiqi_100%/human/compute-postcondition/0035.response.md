The given code snippet recalculates the value of `cn2` using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This means `cn2` is updated based on the current value of `n`.

Given that `cn2` was initially calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, executing this line again would not change its value unless `n` has been modified elsewhere in the code. Since there's no indication that `n` has changed, `cn2` remains the same.

Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read in the `m` iterations, `j` is `2m - 1`, `a`, `b`, `f` are the values from the last iteration, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
