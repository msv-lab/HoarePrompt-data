The code snippet `sum_f += f` updates the value of `sum_f` by adding the current value of `f` to it. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `sum_f`. Since `f` is the third integer from the last input, `sum_f` is updated to its previous value plus `f`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `j` is `m + 1`, `a` is the first integer from the last input, `b` is the second integer from the last input, `f` is the third integer from the last input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `a`, `b`, and `f` are updated to the three integers from the new input.**
