Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the m lines contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i where a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. All pairs (a_i, b_i) are distinct. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The sum of k across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
