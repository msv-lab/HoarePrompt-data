To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the range is determined by `m`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the first integer from the new input
- `m` is the second integer from the new input
- `k` is the third integer from the new input
- `sum_f` is 0
- `j` is `m - 1`
- `a` is the first integer from the last input
- `b` is the second integer from the last input
- `f` is the third integer from the last input
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`
- `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`

The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 so that the loop can execute. The value of `j` before the loop starts (`m - 1`) does not affect the execution of the loop itself, but it should be consistent with the value of `m`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is 0, `j` is `m - 1`, `a` is the first integer from the last input, `b` is the second integer from the last input, `f` is the third integer from the last input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`**
