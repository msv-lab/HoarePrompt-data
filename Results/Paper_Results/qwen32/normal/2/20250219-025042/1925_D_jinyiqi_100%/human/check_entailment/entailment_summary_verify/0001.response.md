### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for excursions. The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 each time that pair is chosen. The result should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Key Points:
1. **Total Possible Pairs**: For `n` children, the total number of possible pairs is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
2. **Friendship Value Increase**: When a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**: We need to consider the probability of choosing a pair and how the friendship values evolve over `k` excursions.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads `m` lines of friend pairs with their initial friendship values.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The program calculates the sum of all initial friendship values (`sum_f`).

3. **Total Possible Pairs**:
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs using the formula \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

4. **Calculating `p` and `q`**:
   - The program calculates `p` and `q` based on the formula:
     - \( p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \)
     - \( q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2 \)
   - Here, `cn2` is the total number of possible pairs, which is \(\binom{n}{2}\).

5. **Simplifying the Fraction**:
   - The program simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

6. **Modular Inverse and Output**:
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9+7\) using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It then computes the result as `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` and prints it.

#### Issues in the Program:
The formula used for `p` and `q` in the program appears to be incorrect. Let's derive the correct formula:

- **Probability of Choosing a Friend Pair**: The probability of choosing a specific friend pair in one excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
- **Expected Increase in Friendship Value**: For a specific friend pair, the expected number of times it is chosen in `k` excursions is \(k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\). The expected sum of friendship values for this pair over `k` excursions is the sum of an arithmetic series:
  \[
  \text{Expected Sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}} i = \frac{(k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}) \cdot (k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} + 1)}{2}
  \]
- **Total Expected Sum for All Friend Pairs**: Summing over all `m` friend pairs, the total expected sum is:
  \[
  \text{Total Expected Sum} = \sum_{\text{all friend pairs}} \left( f_i + \frac{(k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}) \cdot (k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} + 1)}{2} \right)
  \]

The provided formula in the program does not match this derivation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Given the incorrect formula used for `p` and `q`, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Final: False**
