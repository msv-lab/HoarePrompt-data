To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for excursions.
- The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers.
- We need to calculate \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Key Points:
1. **Total Possible Pairs**: \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
2. **Friendship Values**: Each pair of friends starts with a certain friendship value and increases by 1 each time they are chosen.
3. **Expected Value Calculation**: We need to calculate the expected sum of friendship values over \(k\) excursions.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case:
- Reads \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
- Reads the details of each pair of friends and their initial friendship values.
- Calculates `sum_f`: the sum of initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
- Calculates `cn2`: the total number of possible pairs of children.
- Calculates `p` and `q`: the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing the expected value.
- Computes \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Formula for `p` and `q`**:
   - The formula used for `p` and `q` in the program does not match the expected value calculation as described in the problem statement.
   - The current implementation uses `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` and `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`, which is incorrect.

2. **Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The program does not correctly account for the contribution of non-friend pairs to the expected value.
   - Non-friend pairs contribute 0 to the sum of friendship values, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where there are no pairs of friends (\(m = 0\)) correctly.
   - It also does not handle cases where \(k\) is very large relative to \(n\) and \(m\).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly compute the expected value, we need to consider:
- The probability of choosing a friend pair vs. a non-friend pair.
- The expected increase in friendship values for friend pairs over \(k\) excursions.

### Correct Formula:
The correct formula for the expected value involves:
- The probability of choosing a friend pair: \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
- The expected increase in friendship values for each friend pair over \(k\) excursions.

Given these considerations, the correct formula for `p` and `q` would be more complex than what is implemented in the program.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values due to incorrect formulas and lack of proper handling of edge cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

### Explanation:
The program fails to correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values due to incorrect formulas and lack of proper handling of edge cases. Specifically, the formula for `p` and `q` is incorrect, and the program does not account for the contribution of non-friend pairs properly.
