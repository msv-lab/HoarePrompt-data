The code snippet `sum_f += f` updates the value of `sum_f` by adding the current value of `f` to it. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `sum_f` was already defined as `sum_f + f`. After executing `sum_f += f`, the new value of `sum_f` will be `sum_f + f + f`, which simplifies to `sum_f + 2 * f`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `sum_f` is `sum_f + 2 * f`, `j` is 1, `a`, `b`, `f` are the new values from the input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd(p, q)`, `q` is `n * (n - 1) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`**.
