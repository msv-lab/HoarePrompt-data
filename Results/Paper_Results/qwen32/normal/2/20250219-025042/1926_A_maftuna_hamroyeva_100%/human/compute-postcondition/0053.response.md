To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over each character in the string `a`, using the variable `j` to represent each character.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `j`, but since `j` is assigned values from the iterable `a`, we need to ensure that `a` is in a state that allows the loop to execute. Specifically, `a` should be a non-empty string because an empty string would prevent the loop from executing.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `a` must be a non-empty string for the loop to execute.
- The other variables (`t`, `l`, `h`, `i`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty string, `l` is 0, `h` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
