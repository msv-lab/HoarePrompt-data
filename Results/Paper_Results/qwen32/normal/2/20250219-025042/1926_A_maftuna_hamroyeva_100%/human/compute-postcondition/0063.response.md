The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, which iterates over the string `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` to reflect the next character in the string `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0 (this value does not change in the loop head).
- `a` is a non-empty string (this value does not change in the loop head).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (this value does not change in the loop head; it is implied that `i` is used to index into `a` to get `j`).
- `j` is the character at position `i` in `a`.
- The values of `l` and `h` depend on whether `j` equals 'A' and the previous value of `j`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` should be the character at the next position in `a`, which would be `a[i+1]` (assuming `i` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration).

Since the loop head only involves `j`, we only need to update `j` to the next character in the string `a`. The values of `l` and `h` are determined within the loop body and do not affect the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the character at position `i+1` in `a`**.
