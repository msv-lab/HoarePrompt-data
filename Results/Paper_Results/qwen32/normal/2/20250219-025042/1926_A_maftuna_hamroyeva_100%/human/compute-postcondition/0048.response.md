Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is the new user's input as a string; `l` is the count of 'A' characters in `a`; `h` is the count of all other characters in `a`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `l` is greater than `h`, then `l` is indeed greater than `h`. Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h`.**
