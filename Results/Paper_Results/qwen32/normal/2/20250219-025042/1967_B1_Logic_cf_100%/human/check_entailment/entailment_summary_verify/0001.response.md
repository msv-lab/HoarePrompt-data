### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided code and the problem requirements to determine if the code is indeed incorrect.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then calculates `ans` as follows:
1. Initialize `ans` to `n`.
2. Loop through `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
3. For each `b`, increment `ans` by `(n + b) // (b * b)`.
4. Print `ans`.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary confirms that the code reads `t` test cases, reads `n` and `m` for each test case, computes a value `ans`, and prints `ans`.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The original assessment suggests that initializing `ans` with `n` is incorrect. However, let's verify this.
2. **Logic inside the loop:** The formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` seems suspicious, but let's derive the logic behind it.
3. **Range of `b`:** The original assessment suggests that `b` should range from 1 to `m`. However, the code starts from 2, which might be intentional.

#### Detailed Derivation:
To understand the logic, let's derive the formula `(n + b) // (b * b)`.

For a fixed `b`, we need to find the number of `a` such that:
\[ a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ a \equiv -b \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]

Since \(\gcd(a, b)\) divides \(b\), let's denote \(\gcd(a, b) = d\). Then \(b = d \cdot k\) for some integer \(k\). The condition becomes:
\[ a \equiv -d \cdot k \pmod{d \cdot k} \]
\[ a \equiv 0 \pmod{d} \]

So, \(a\) must be a multiple of \(d\). Let \(a = d \cdot x\). The condition now is:
\[ d \cdot x + d \cdot k \equiv 0 \pmod{d \cdot k} \]
\[ d \cdot (x + k) \equiv 0 \pmod{d \cdot k} \]
\[ x + k \equiv 0 \pmod{k} \]
\[ x \equiv 0 \pmod{k} \]

Thus, \(x\) must be a multiple of \(k\). So, \(a = d \cdot k \cdot y\) for some integer \(y\). The number of such `a` is the number of multiples of \(d \cdot k\) up to `n`.

The number of multiples of \(d \cdot k\) up to `n` is:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{n}{d \cdot k} \right\rfloor \]

However, the code uses a simplified formula:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor \]

This formula seems to be derived from considering the sum of valid `a` values for each `b`.

#### Verification:
Let's verify the formula with the example test cases provided in the problem description.

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Calculation: `ans = 1` (initially `n`), no additional terms since `b` starts from 2.
   - Output: `1` (correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2 3`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Calculation: `ans = 2` (initially `n`), add terms for `b = 2` and `b = 3`.
     - For `b = 2`: `(2 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 1`
     - For `b = 3`: `(2 + 3) // (3 * 3) = 0`
   - Output: `3` (correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Calculation: `ans = 3` (initially `n`), add terms for `b = 2` to `b = 3`.
     - For `b = 2`: `(3 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 1`
     - For `b = 3`: `(3 + 3) // (3 * 3) = 0`
   - Output: `4` (correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `10 8`
   - Expected Output: `14`
   - Calculation: `ans = 10` (initially `n`), add terms for `b = 2` to `b = 8`.
     - For `b = 2`: `(10 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 3`
     - For `b = 3`: `(10 + 3) // (3 * 3) = 1`
     - For `b = 4`: `(10 + 4) // (4 * 4) = 0`
     - For `b = 5`: `(10 + 5) // (5 * 5) = 0`
     - For `b = 6`: `(10 + 6) // (6 * 6) = 0`
     - For `b = 7`: `(10 + 7) // (7 * 7) = 0`
     - For `b = 8`: `(10 + 8) // (8 * 8) = 0`
   - Output: `14` (correct)

Based on the above verification, the provided code seems to correctly compute the number of valid pairs for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly identified issues with the code. The code appears to be correctly implementing the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:
Final: **True**
