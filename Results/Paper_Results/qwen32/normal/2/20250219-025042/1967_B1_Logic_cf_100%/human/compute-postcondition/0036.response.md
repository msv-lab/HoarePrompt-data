To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation involved in calculating `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` is the first positive integer from the input.
- `m` is the second positive integer from the input.
- `ans` is calculated as `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`.
- `T` is incremented by 1 (`T = T + 1`), but this does not affect the calculation of `ans`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **First Term**: The first term in the expression for `ans` is simply `n`.
2. **Summation Term**: The summation part is computed as follows:
   - It iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
   - For each `b`, it calculates `(n + b) // (b * b)`.
   - The `//` operator performs integer division.
   - These values are summed up.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `n = 10` and `m = 5` for concreteness. The steps would be:

1. **First Term**: `n = 10`
2. **Summation Term**:
   - For `b = 2`: `(10 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 12 // 4 = 3`
   - For `b = 3`: `(10 + 3) // (3 * 3) = 13 // 9 = 1`
   - For `b = 4`: `(10 + 4) // (4 * 4) = 14 // 16 = 0`
   - For `b = 5`: `(10 + 5) // (5 * 5) = 15 // 25 = 0`
   - Sum of these values: `3 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 4`

3. **Final Calculation**: `ans = n + sum(...) = 10 + 4 = 14`

### General Case:
Given `n` and `m`, the value of `ans` will be `n` plus the sum of the integer divisions `(n + b) // (b * b)` for `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`.

### Output:
Based on the above explanation, the output will be the value of `ans` as calculated from the formula provided.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)))**
