You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, computes a specific value `ans` based on these inputs, and prints `ans` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve this problem but seems to have some issues in its logic.

Here's a breakdown of the code:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`.
3. It initializes `ans` with `n`, which is not clear why.
4. It then iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
5. Inside the loop, it increments `ans` by `(n + b) // (b * b)`.
6. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Initialization of `ans`:** The initialization of `ans` with `n` does not align with the problem requirements. The number of valid pairs should be calculated from scratch for each test case.
2. **Logic inside the loop:** The formula `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs for each `b`. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) needs to be properly checked for each pair \((a, b)\).
3. **Range of `b`:** The loop runs from 2 to `min(n, m)`, but it should consider `b` from 1 to `m` as per the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done using nested loops, but due to the constraints, an optimized approach might be necessary.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:
Correctness: **False**
