To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):`, which means the variable `b` is the only one that can be adjusted.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` must be at least 2
- `m` must be at least 2
- `ans` is the original `ans` plus `(n + b) // (b * b)`

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` would have taken some value between 2 and `min(n, m)` inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must still be within the range `[2, min(n, m)]`.

Let's assume `b` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be `k + 1`. We need to ensure that `k + 1` is still within the valid range, i.e., `k + 1 <= min(n, m)`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize the state as follows:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `n` must be at least 2 (unchanged)
- `m` must be at least 2 (unchanged)
- `ans` is the original `ans` plus `(n + b) // (b * b)` (unchanged except for the new value of `b`)
- `b` is incremented by 1 from its previous value

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is the original `ans` plus `(n + b) // (b * b)`, `b` is incremented by 1**
