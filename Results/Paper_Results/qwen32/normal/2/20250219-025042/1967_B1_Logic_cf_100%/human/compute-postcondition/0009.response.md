To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was incremented by 1.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is updated based on the formula `ans = ans + 2 * ((n + b) // (b * b))`.

Let's analyze the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `b`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

2. **Variables `n` and `m`:**
   - These variables are not modified within the loop head; they remain constant throughout the loop iterations. Hence, their values do not change from the end of the previous iteration to the start of the next iteration.

3. **Variable `ans`:**
   - Although `ans` is updated within the loop body, it is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted for the start of the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `b` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `t` must still be greater than 0.
- `ans` remains as it was calculated at the end of the previous iteration (though this doesn't affect the loop head).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
