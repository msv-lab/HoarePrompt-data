To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each pair of `n` and `m` provided by the input and computes the value of `ans` for each iteration.

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `t` represents the total number of iterations the loop will perform. For each iteration, the loop reads two integers `n` and `m`.
2. **Computation for Each Iteration**:
   - Initialize `ans` to `n`.
   - For each `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`, compute `(n + b) // (b * b)` and add it to `ans`.
   - Print the final value of `ans` for that iteration.

Since the loop runs `t` times, we will have `t` different pairs of `n` and `m`, and for each pair, we compute and print a corresponding `ans`.

### Final Output State Description

After all `t` iterations, the program will have printed `t` lines, each containing the computed `ans` for the respective pair of `n` and `m`. The state of `t` remains unchanged as it simply dictates the number of iterations. The variables `n` and `m` will hold the values of the last pair processed, but they are not retained outside of their respective iterations.

The final output state can be described as follows:

- The variable `t` retains its initial value as it only indicates the number of iterations.
- For each iteration `i` (from 1 to `t`), the program prints a line with the value of `ans` computed using the `n` and `m` values provided for that iteration.

Thus, the final output state is essentially the sequence of printed `ans` values for each of the `t` iterations.

Output State: **The program prints `t` lines, each containing the value of `ans` computed for the respective pair of `n` and `m` provided in the input.**
