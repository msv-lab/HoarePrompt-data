To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is the first positive integer from the input.
   - `m` is the second positive integer from the input.
   - `ans` is initially some value (let's call this initial value `ans_initial`).
   - `ans` is then updated by adding the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.

2. **Computation**:
   - We need to calculate the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
   - This sum is added to the initial value of `ans`.

3. **Output**:
   - The final value of `ans` after the update will be printed.

Given the above steps, the final value of `ans` can be described as the initial value of `ans` plus the computed sum. Since the specific values of `n`, `m`, and the initial `ans` are not provided, we can only describe the final value in terms of these variables.

Let's formalize this in the required output format:

Output: **ans_initial + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)) (where ans_initial is the initial value of ans, n is the first positive integer from the input, m is the second positive integer from the input, and the sum is calculated for b ranging from 2 to min(n, m))**
