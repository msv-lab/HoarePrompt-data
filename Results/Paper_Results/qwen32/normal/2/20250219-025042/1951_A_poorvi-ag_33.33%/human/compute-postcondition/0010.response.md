The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. Therefore, `results` will now contain two elements: `'no'` and `'no'`.

Other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that start <= end; `t` is greater than 0; `results` contains two elements 'no', 'no'; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the value of the user input and contains exactly two consecutive '1's ('11' is a substring of `arr`).**
