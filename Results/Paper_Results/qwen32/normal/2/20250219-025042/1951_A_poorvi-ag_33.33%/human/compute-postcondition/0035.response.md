The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This means that regardless of the initial contents of `results`, `'no'` will be added to it. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `results` includes `'no'`.**
