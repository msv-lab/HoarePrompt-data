Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that start <= end; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing one element 'no'; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the value of the user input and contains exactly two occurrences of the character '1', which are consecutive ('11' is a substring of `arr`).**

In simple terms, the `results` list now contains the string 'no', while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
