In this case, the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. The loop variable `r` takes on the value of each element in `results` during each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is an input integer.
- `results` is a list containing at least one element (e.g., `['yes']` or `['no']`).

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop variable `r` and the `results` list. Since the loop iterates over `results`, the loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `results`.

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `r` took the value of the first element in `results`. For the next iteration, `r` should take the value of the next element in the list.

However, the given information does not specify the current position in the list or how many elements have been processed. Therefore, we can infer that if the loop has just finished processing the first element, the next element should be processed.

Since the loop variable `r` is the only one that changes with each iteration and it directly depends on the `results` list, we need to adjust `r` to the next element in the list.

If `results` initially had more than one element, then after the first iteration, the next iteration would process the second element.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is a list containing at least two elements (e.g., `['yes', 'no']`); `r` is the second element in `results`**.

However, since we don't know the exact elements in `results` or their count beyond the fact that there is at least one element, we can generalize the state as follows:
State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is a list containing at least one element; `r` is the next element in `results`**.

But to match the format of the previous examples more closely, we can say:
State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is a list containing at least two elements; `r` is the second element in `results`**.

Since we don't have specific information about the number of elements or their values beyond the first, the most accurate general state would be:
State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is a list containing at least one element; `r` is the next element in `results`**.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `results` has at least two elements:
State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is a list containing at least two elements (e.g., `['yes', 'no']`); `r` is `'no'`**.

But sticking to the general form:
State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer; `results` is a list containing at least one element; `r` is the next element in `results`**.
