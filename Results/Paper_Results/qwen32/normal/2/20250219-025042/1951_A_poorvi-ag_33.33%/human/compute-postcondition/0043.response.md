To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is an input integer.
- `results` is a list containing at least two elements.
- `r` is the next element in `results`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(r)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `r` is described as "the next element in `results`". However, without knowing the specific index of `r` in the `results` list, we cannot pinpoint its exact value.
- We know that `results` contains at least two elements, but we don't know their values.
- The variable `r` could be any element from `results` starting from the second element (index 1) since it's mentioned as the "next element" implying it's not the first one.

Given the information, we can only describe `r` in terms of its position in the `results` list.

### Conclusion:
The `print(r)` statement will print the next element in the `results` list, which is the element at index 1 or any subsequent index if `r` is defined differently in the context of the code (which isn't provided here).

Output: **r (where r is the next element in the `results` list)**
