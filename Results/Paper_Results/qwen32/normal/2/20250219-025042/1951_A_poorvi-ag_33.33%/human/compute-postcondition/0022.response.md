Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of the user input; `arr` is the value of the new user input; `results` contains one additional element `'no'`; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `results` list now includes an additional element `'no'`. The variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` retain their previous states except that `i` has been incremented by 1.
