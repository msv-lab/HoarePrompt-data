Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `arr`. It checks the conditions on the string `arr` to determine if it should append 'yes' or 'no' to the `results` list. Finally, it prints each element in the `results` list.**
