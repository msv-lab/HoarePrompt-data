Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is an input integer.
- `results` is a list containing at least one element (e.g., `['yes']` or `['no']`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(r)
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet attempts to print the variable `r`. However, there is no mention of the variable `r` in the initial state provided. This means that `r` is either undefined or not mentioned in the context given.

Given that `r` is not defined or described in the initial state, it would result in a `NameError` if this code were to be executed. Since the task is to determine what will be printed, and `r` is not defined, we cannot provide a value for `r`.

However, based on the instructions provided, we should describe the output as precisely as possible. In this case, the precise description is that `r` is undefined.

### Conclusion:
Output: **NameError: name 'r' is not defined** (since `r` is not defined in the given initial state)
