The code snippet `arr = input()` assigns the value of user input to the variable `arr`. This means the previous value of `arr` is overwritten by whatever the user inputs.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of the user input; `arr` is the value of the new user input; `results` is determined based on the conditions given; `i` is incremented by 1.**
In natural language: The value of `arr` has been updated to the new user input. All other variables retain their previous values.
