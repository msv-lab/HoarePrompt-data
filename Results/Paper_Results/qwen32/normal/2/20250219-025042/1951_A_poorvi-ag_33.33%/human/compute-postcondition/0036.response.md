Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 1`, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's and '11' as a substring, `results` includes `'no'`. If `arr.count('1')` is even and does not meet the exact two '1's and '11' as a substring condition, `results` includes `'yes'`. Otherwise, `results` includes `'no'`.**
