Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the value of the user input. If `arr` contains exactly two consecutive '1's ('11' is a substring of `arr`), `results` contains one or two elements 'no'. Otherwise, `results` is either an empty list, contains one element 'no', or contains ['no', 'yes'] or ['yes']. The count of '1's in `arr` is either even or odd, corresponding to the execution of the if or else part respectively.**
