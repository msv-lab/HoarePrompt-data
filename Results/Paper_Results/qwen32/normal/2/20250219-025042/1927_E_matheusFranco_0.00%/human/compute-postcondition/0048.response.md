The code snippet increments the value of `curr_v` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with `permutation[1 + 2k]` set to `curr_v`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 2k`; `i` is 1; `n` must be greater than `1 + 2k`; `curr_v` is incremented by 1.**
