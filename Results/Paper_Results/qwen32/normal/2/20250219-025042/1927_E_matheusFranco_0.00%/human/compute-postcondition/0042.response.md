To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k`.
- `i` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must still be less than `len(permutation)`, which is `n`.

### Analysis:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was `1 + k`.
- The length of `permutation` is `n`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than `n`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at `1 + k` and `k` is at least 2 (as \(2 \leq k\)), `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is at least 3.

### Adjustment:
- We need to ensure that `1 + k < n`. This is already given by the problem constraints \(2 \leq k \leq n\), so no further adjustment is needed for `k` and `n` based on this condition alone.
- The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` should remain less than `n` for the loop to continue. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is calculated as `1 + k` initially and `k` is even and within the bounds, it will naturally be less than `n` as long as `n` is greater than `1 + k`.

### Conclusion:
No specific adjustments are needed to the state variables `n`, `k`, or `multiples_of_k_plus_i` because the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` is already satisfied based on the given constraints.

Thus, the state remains the same for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values `1, 2, 3, ..., m+1` at indices `0, k, 2k, ..., mk` respectively, and `m+2, m+3, ..., m+m+1` at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ..., i+mk` respectively except that `permutation[1]` is `m+m+2`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `m+m+3`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + k`; `i` is 1.**
