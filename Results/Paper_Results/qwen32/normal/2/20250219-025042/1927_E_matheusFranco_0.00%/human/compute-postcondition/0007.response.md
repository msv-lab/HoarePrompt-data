The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1, which means it satisfies the condition to execute the loop again.

Since `t` is at least 1, no further adjustment is needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is at least 1**
