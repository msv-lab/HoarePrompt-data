To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.
- Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initially set to `i + 2k`, and `i` is the next integer in the range from `0` to `k-1`, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` remains less than `len(permutation)`.

### Current State:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initially `i + 2k`.
- `i` is the next integer in the range from `0` to `k-1`.

### Adjustment:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must still be less than `n` (the length of `permutation`).
- Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k` in each iteration, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` remains within the bounds of the list.

### Steps:
1. **Ensure `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than `n`:**
   - Initially, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k`.
   - In the next iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `i + 3k`, then `i + 4k`, and so on.
   - We need to ensure that `i + (m+2)k < n` for some integer `m`.

2. **Adjust `i` and `multiples_of_k_plus_i`:**
   - Since `i` is the next integer in the range from `0` to `k-1`, we need to ensure that the next value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` remains valid.
   - If `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is already close to `n`, we might need to adjust `i` to a smaller value or ensure `n` is large enough.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the current state, the primary adjustment needed is to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` remains less than `n`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k` in each iteration, we need to ensure that `n` is sufficiently large to accommodate this increment.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, such that \(2 \leq k \leq n\) and \(k\) is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` where `i` is the next integer in the range from `0` to `k-1`; `n` must be greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k`**
