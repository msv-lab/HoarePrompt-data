### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution using the annotated code and the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for excursions. The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen. We need to output the result as `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)`.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. **func_1(n, m, k, friendships)**:
   - Iterates over each friendship.
   - For each friendship `(a, b, f)`, it adds `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` to the result.
   - The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the total increase in the friendship value if the pair is chosen every time.

2. **func_2()**:
   - Handles multiple test cases.
   - Reads input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the result.

#### Annotations:
Annotations confirm the state of variables and the logic within the functions. However, they do not address the correctness of the mathematical approach used.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
The key issue with the provided solution lies in the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`. This formula assumes that each friendship pair is chosen `k` times, which is incorrect. Instead, each pair has a probability of `1 / C(n, 2)` of being chosen in any given excursion, where `C(n, 2)` is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`.

The expected number of times a specific pair `(a, b)` is chosen over `k` excursions is `k / C(n, 2)`. The expected contribution of a specific pair `(a, b)` to the total sum should consider the probability of being chosen and the increase in friendship value due to previous choices.

However, the provided solution does not account for these probabilities and dynamic changes. Instead, it incorrectly assumes each pair is chosen `k` times, leading to an overestimation of the expected value.

#### Correct Approach:
1. Calculate the probability of choosing each pair `(a, b)` in one excursion: `1 / C(n, 2)`.
2. Calculate the expected number of times each pair is chosen over `k` excursions: `k / C(n, 2)`.
3. Calculate the expected contribution of each friendship to the total sum, considering the increase in friendship value due to previous choices.
4. Sum up the contributions of all friendships to get the final expected value.
5. Convert the final expected value to the required format `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)`.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is indeed incorrect because it does not properly account for the probabilities and dynamic changes in friendship values.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
