Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of lists `friendships`. The parameter `n` represents the number of children, `m` represents the number of pairs of friends, and `k` represents the number of excursions. Each sublist in `friendships` contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing a pair of friends and their friendship value. The function returns the total maximum friendship value that can be achieved over `k` excursions among the `n` children considering the `m` pairs of friends and their respective friendship values.**
