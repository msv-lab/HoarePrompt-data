The code snippet provided reads `m` lines of input, each containing three integers representing a pair of friends and their friendship value. This updates the `friendships` list with these new values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9; `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**

Natural Language: The `friendships` list has been updated to include `m` sublists, each containing three integers representing pairs of friends and their friendship values. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, and `result`) remain unchanged.
