### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Friendship Value Calculation**:
   - We need to calculate the expected sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen over `k` excursions.
   - For each pair of friends `(a, b)` with an initial friendship value `f`, the expected number of times this pair is chosen in `k` excursions is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
   - Therefore, the expected contribution of this pair to the total sum is `f * (k / (n * (n - 1) / 2))`.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since we need to output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\), we must ensure that all calculations respect this constraint to avoid overflow and ensure correctness.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2()` correctly reads multiple test cases and processes each one using `func_1()`.
   - However, `func_1()` needs to correctly compute the expected value as described above.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The current implementation incorrectly calculates the contribution of each friendship by multiplying the initial friendship value `f` by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`).
  - This approach assumes that each friendship pair will be chosen exactly `k` times, which is incorrect. Instead, it should multiply by the expected number of times the pair is chosen, which is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function correctly reads multiple test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.
  - However, since `func_1()` is incorrect, the overall program is incorrect.

#### Corrected Approach:
- The expected contribution of each friendship `(a, b)` with initial value `f` should be `f * (k / (n * (n - 1) / 2))`.
- To handle floating-point division and modulo operations correctly, we can use modular arithmetic properties. Specifically, we can use the modular multiplicative inverse to handle the division under modulo.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def mod_inverse(x, mod):
    return pow(x, mod - 2, mod)

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    inv_total_pairs = mod_inverse(total_pairs, MOD)
    expected_value = 0
    for a, b, f in friendships:
        expected_value += f * (k * inv_total_pairs) % MOD
    return expected_value % MOD

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

In this corrected version:
- We calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of `total_pairs` using Fermat's Little Theorem.
- We then compute the expected contribution of each friendship using this inverse and sum these contributions modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct because the provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The program incorrectly assumes that each pair is chosen exactly `k` times, rather than calculating the expected number of times each pair is chosen.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
