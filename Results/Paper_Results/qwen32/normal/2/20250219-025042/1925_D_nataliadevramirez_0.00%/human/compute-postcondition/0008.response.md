The code snippet reads `m` lines of input, each containing three integers, and updates the `friendships` list accordingly. Given that `friendships` was initially a list of `m` sublists, after executing the code, `friendships` will contain the newly read values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9; `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**

In simpler terms, the `friendships` list is updated with the new values read from the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
