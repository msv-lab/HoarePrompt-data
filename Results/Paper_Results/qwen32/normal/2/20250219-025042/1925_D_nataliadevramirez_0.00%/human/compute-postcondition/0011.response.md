The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable whose value we don't plan to use). However, since the loop runs `t` times, the variable `t` itself determines how many more times the loop can execute. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, ensuring it remains greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this decrement.

State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9; `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**
