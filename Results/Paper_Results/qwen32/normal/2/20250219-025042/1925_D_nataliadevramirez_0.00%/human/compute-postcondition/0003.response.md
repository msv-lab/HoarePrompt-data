The given code reads `m` lines of input, where each line contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their friendship value. These lines are used to populate the `friendships` list.

Given the initial state, `friendships` was initially described as a list of lists, but its contents were not specified. After executing the code snippet, `friendships` will be updated to contain the specific pairs of friends and their friendship values as read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9; `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.**
