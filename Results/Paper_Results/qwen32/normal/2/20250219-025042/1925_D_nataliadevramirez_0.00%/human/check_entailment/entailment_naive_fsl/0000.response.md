Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The program calculates the contribution of each friendship by multiplying the initial friendship value `f` by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`). This approach assumes that each friendship pair will be chosen exactly `k` times, which is not the case. The probability of choosing any specific pair in one excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`, and the expected number of times a pair is chosen in `k` excursions is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
   - The correct calculation for the expected contribution of a friendship `(a, b)` with initial value `f` should be `f * (k / (n * (n - 1) / 2))`.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is applied after the multiplication, which could lead to incorrect results due to overflow issues before applying the modulo. The correct approach would be to apply the modulo operation during the calculation to prevent overflow.

3. **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2()` correctly reads multiple test cases, but the function `func_1()` does not handle the expected value calculation correctly as explained above.

### Correct Approach:

To fix the program, the expected value calculation should be adjusted to account for the probability of selecting each pair. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    expected_value = 0
    for a, b, f in friendships:
        expected_value += f * (k / total_pairs) % MOD
    return int(expected_value) % MOD

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

In this corrected version, the expected value for each friendship is calculated using the probability of selecting the pair, and the modulo operation is applied correctly to avoid overflow.
