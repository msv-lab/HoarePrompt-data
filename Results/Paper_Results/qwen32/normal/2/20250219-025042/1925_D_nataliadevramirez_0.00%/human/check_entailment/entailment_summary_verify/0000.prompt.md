You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
    return result % MOD

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, the number of excursions, and the list of friendships with their respective values. For each test case, it computes and prints the total maximum friendship value that can be achieved over the specified number of excursions among the children, considering the given pairs of friends and their friendship values.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The program calculates the contribution of each friendship by multiplying the initial friendship value `f` by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`). This approach assumes that each friendship pair will be chosen exactly `k` times, which is not the case. The probability of choosing any specific pair in one excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`, and the expected number of times a pair is chosen in `k` excursions is `k / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
   - The correct calculation for the expected contribution of a friendship `(a, b)` with initial value `f` should be `f * (k / (n * (n - 1) / 2))`.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is applied after the multiplication, which could lead to incorrect results due to overflow issues before applying the modulo. The correct approach would be to apply the modulo operation during the calculation to prevent overflow.

3. **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2()` correctly reads multiple test cases, but the function `func_1()` does not handle the expected value calculation correctly as explained above.

### Correct Approach:

To fix the program, the expected value calculation should be adjusted to account for the probability of selecting each pair. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    expected_value = 0
    for a, b, f in friendships:
        expected_value += f * (k / total_pairs) % MOD
    return int(expected_value) % MOD

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

In this corrected version, the expected value for each friendship is calculated using the probability of selecting the pair, and the modulo operation is applied correctly to avoid overflow.
