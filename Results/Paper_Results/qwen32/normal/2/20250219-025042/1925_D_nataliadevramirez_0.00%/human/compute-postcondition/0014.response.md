To determine the output state, we need to understand what the function `func_1` does. Since the implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only infer the output state based on the given input parameters and the fact that `result` is assigned the value returned by `func_1`.

Given:
- `n` is an integer read from input.
- `m` is an integer read from input.
- `k` is an integer read from input.
- `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`.
- `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

Since `func_1` is called with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`, and `result` is assigned the value returned by this function, the output state will reflect the updated value of `result`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, `f_i`, `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.

In natural language: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`, and `t` remain unchanged. The variable `result` now holds the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.
