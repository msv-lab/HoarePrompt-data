To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `n` is an integer read from input, representing the number of people.
- `m` is an integer read from input, representing the number of friendships.
- `k` is an integer read from input, likely representing some constraint or parameter related to the problem.
- `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists, where each sublist contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. These represent a pair of friends (`a_i` and `b_i`) and their friendship value (`f_i`).
- `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, but it is not used in the given code snippet.
- `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

Given this information, the `print(result)` statement will output whatever value is returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the output of this function based on the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.

Thus, the output will be described in terms of the function's return value.

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by func_1(n, m, k, friendships))**
