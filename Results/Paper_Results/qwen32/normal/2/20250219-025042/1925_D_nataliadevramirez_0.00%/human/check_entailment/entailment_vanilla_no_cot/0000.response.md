Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions incorrectly. 

The issue lies in the formula used inside `func_1`. The current implementation assumes that every friendship value will increase by the sum of the first k natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`), which is incorrect. This formula would be applicable if every pair was chosen exactly once in every possible combination, but since the pairs are chosen randomly and independently, the expected contribution of each friendship value must be calculated differently.

The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in k trials is `k / C(n, 2)` where `C(n, 2)` is the total number of possible pairs, which is `n * (n - 1) / 2`. The expected contribution of a friendship value `f` for a specific pair is then `f * (k / C(n, 2))`. Since this happens independently for each of the `m` pairs, we need to sum these contributions.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def mod_inverse(a, m):
    m0, x0, x1 = m, 0, 1
    if m == 1:
        return 0
    while a > 1:
        # q is quotient
        q = a // m
        m, a = a % m, m
        x0, x1 = x1 - q * x0, x0
    # Make x1 positive
    if x1 < 0:
        x1 += m0
    return x1

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    if total_pairs == 0:
        return 0
    inv_total_pairs = mod_inverse(total_pairs, MOD)
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        expected_increase = (k * inv_total_pairs) % MOD
        result = (result + (f * expected_increase) % MOD) % MOD
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)

```

In this corrected version, we calculate the modular inverse of the total number of pairs to find the expected number of times each pair is chosen, and then use this to compute the expected contribution of each friendship value.
