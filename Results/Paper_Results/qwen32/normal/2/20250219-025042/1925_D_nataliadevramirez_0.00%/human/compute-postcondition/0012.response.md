The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be updated based on the input provided, while the other variables (`friendships`, `t`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9; `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.
