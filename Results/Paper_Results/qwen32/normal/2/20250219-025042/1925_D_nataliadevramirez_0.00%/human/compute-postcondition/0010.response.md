To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the components involved:

1. **Variables and Inputs**:
   - `n`: An integer read from input, representing the number of people.
   - `m`: An integer read from input, representing the number of friendships.
   - `k`: An integer read from input, which could represent a threshold or a specific parameter for the function `func_1`.
   - `friendships`: A list of `m` sublists, where each sublist contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. These integers represent a pair of friends (`a_i` and `b_i`) and their friendship value (`f_i`).
   - `t`: An integer that must be greater than or equal to 0. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
   - `result`: The value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.
   - It processes these inputs to compute some result, which is then stored in the variable `result`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will output the value computed by `func_1`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise numerical value of `result`. However, based on the initial state and the context, we can describe `result` as the output of the function `func_1` given the inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.

Therefore, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by func_1(n, m, k, friendships))**
