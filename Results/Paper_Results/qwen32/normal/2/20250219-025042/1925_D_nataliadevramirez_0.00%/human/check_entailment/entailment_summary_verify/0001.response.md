### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided solution against the problem requirements and the function summaries.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` randomly chosen pairs of children over multiple test cases.
- Each chosen pair of friends has its friendship value increased by 1 for subsequent excursions.
- The final expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**:
   - This function processes a single test case.
   - It iterates over each friendship and calculates its contribution to the result using the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the result.

#### Function Summary:
- The function summary suggests that `func_2` computes and prints the total maximum friendship value that can be achieved over the specified number of excursions among the children, considering the given pairs of friends and their friendship values.

#### Issues with the Provided Solution:
- The formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of choosing a specific pair and the dynamic increase in friendship values due to previous choices.
- The formula assumes that each pair will be chosen exactly `k` times, which is not true since the selection is random and independent.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair `(a, b)` in one excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
   - The expected number of times a specific pair `(a, b)` is chosen over `k` excursions is \(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2k}{n(n-1)}\).

2. **Expected Contribution**:
   - For a pair `(a, b)` with initial friendship value `f`, the expected contribution to the total sum can be derived from the expected number of times it is chosen and the increase in its friendship value.
   - The expected contribution of a specific pair `(a, b)` is the sum of the expected friendship values over `k` excursions, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

3. **Summing Contributions**:
   - Sum up the contributions of all friendships to get the final expected value.
   - Convert the final expected value to the required format \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution is indeed incorrect because it does not correctly account for the probability of choosing each pair and the dynamic increase in friendship values. The formula used does not reflect the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
