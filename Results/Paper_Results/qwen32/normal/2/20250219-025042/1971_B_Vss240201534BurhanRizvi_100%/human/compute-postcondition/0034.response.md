Let's analyze the given task step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is the string provided by the user input.
- `s2` is either the string `s` rotated to the left by one position or remains unchanged if `s` is not equal to `s2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. The values of `t`, `s`, and `s2` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it directly prints the string `'Yes'` without referencing any of these variables.

### Output:
The code will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `s`, and `s2`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **Yes**
