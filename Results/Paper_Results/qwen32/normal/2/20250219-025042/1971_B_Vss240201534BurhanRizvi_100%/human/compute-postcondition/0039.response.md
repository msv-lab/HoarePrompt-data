Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases (with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, `s`, which is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the content of the string `s`.**
