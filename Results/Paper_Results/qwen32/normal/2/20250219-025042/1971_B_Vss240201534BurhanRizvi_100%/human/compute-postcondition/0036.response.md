Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the string provided by the user input. If `s` consists of the same character repeated more than once (`len(set(s)) == 1` and `len(s) > 1`), then no additional changes are made to `s`. Otherwise, `s2` is either the string `s` rotated to the left by one position or remains unchanged if `s` is not equal to `s2`.**
