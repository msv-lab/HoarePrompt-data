You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: A series of "No" or "Yes" followed by modified strings `s2` for each test case, depending on the conditions specified.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a string `s`. For each string, it determines if the string can be rearranged to form a different string. If the string cannot be rearranged (either because it has only one character or all characters are the same), it outputs "No". Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" and provides a rearranged version of the string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Rearrange the characters of `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`, or report that it's impossible.
- Output "YES" followed by the rearranged string `r` if possible; otherwise, output "NO".

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, and for each string `s`:
1. If the length of `s` is 1, it outputs "NO".
2. If all characters in `s` are the same (checked using `len(set(s)) == 1`), it outputs "NO".
3. Otherwise, it attempts to create a new string `s2` by randomly shuffling the characters of `s`.
4. If the shuffled string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, it performs a simple swap of the first two characters.
5. It then outputs "YES" followed by the rearranged string `s2`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Random Shuffling**: The use of `random.sample` to shuffle the string is not guaranteed to produce a different string every time, especially for smaller strings. There is a chance that the shuffled string could be the same as the original string, which would make the program incorrect.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the cases where the string length is 1 or all characters are the same correctly. However, the random approach might fail for some specific inputs where the random shuffle doesn't change the string.

### Example Case Where the Program Might Fail:
Consider the string "aaabbb":
- The program might randomly shuffle "aaabbb" into "aaabbb" again, which would lead to the incorrect conclusion that a valid rearrangement is not possible.
- The simple swap `s[1:] + s[0]` might also not always produce a valid rearrangement if the original string has a repeating pattern.

### Conclusion:
Given the reliance on random shuffling, there is a possibility that the program might incorrectly conclude that a valid rearrangement is not possible for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program relies on random shuffling to generate a different string, which is not guaranteed to produce a different string every time. This makes the program incorrect for some potential cases.
