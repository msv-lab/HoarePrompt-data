The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `s`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is described as an integer within the range 1 to 1000 inclusive.
2. The variable `s` is described as a string provided by the user input.
3. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference `t` or `s`, the output is solely determined by the content of the string inside the `print` function.

Output: **No**
