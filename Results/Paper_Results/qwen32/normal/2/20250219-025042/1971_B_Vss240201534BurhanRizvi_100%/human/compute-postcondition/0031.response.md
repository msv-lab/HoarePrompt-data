The code shuffles the characters of the string `s` using `random.sample` and assigns the result to `s2`. The original string `s` remains unchanged, and `t` retains its value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the string provided by the user input, `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`.**
