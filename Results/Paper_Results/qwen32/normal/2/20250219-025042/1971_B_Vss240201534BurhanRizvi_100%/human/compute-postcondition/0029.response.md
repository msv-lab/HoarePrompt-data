Let's analyze the given task step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is the string provided by the user input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is printing the string `'No'`.
- The values of `t` and `s` do not affect the output of this particular `print` statement because the string `'No'` is explicitly specified and does not depend on any variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'No'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **No**
