Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the string provided by the user input; `s2` is a string that contains all characters from `s` but in a random order.**

Natural Language: The value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The original string `s` remains the same as provided by the user. A new string `s2` is created, which consists of all the characters from `s` but arranged in a random order.
