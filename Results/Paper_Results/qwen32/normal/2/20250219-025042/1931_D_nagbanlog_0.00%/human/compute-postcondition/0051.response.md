To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `a`, which is `case['array']`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a)
- `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`
- `n` is the first element of `case['params']`
- `x` is the second element of `case['params']`
- `y` is the third element of `case['params']`
- `a` is `case['array']`
- `freq` is an empty dictionary
- `beautiful_count` is 0

The loop is defined as:
```python
for num in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element since the loop iterates over `a`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `case['array']` is not empty.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0**
