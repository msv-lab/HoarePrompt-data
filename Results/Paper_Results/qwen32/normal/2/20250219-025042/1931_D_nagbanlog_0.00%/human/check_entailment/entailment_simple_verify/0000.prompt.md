You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find pairs of indices \((i, j)\) in an array \(a\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem using a frequency dictionary to keep track of pairs of remainders modulo \(x\) and \(y\). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to store the counts of pairs of remainders \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).

2. **Iterating through the array**: For each element `num` in the array:
   - It calculates `mod_x` as `num % x`.
   - It calculates `mod_y` as `num % y`.
   - It calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This is intended to find the complement remainder that would make the sum of two numbers divisible by \(x\).
   - It keeps `required_mod_y` as `mod_y` because the difference condition \(a_i - a_j\) being divisible by \(y\) implies that both numbers should have the same remainder modulo \(y\).

3. **Counting beautiful pairs**: 
   - It checks if the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The program seems to handle the basic logic correctly, but we need to ensure it works for all edge cases.
- **Modulo Arithmetic**: The logic for calculating `required_mod_x` is correct for finding pairs whose sum is divisible by \(x\).
- **Frequency Dictionary**: The frequency dictionary is used effectively to count pairs without nested loops, which is efficient.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider a few test cases to see if the program behaves as expected:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `n = 6, x = 5, y = 2, a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `n = 7, x = 9, y = 5, a = [1, 10, 15, 3, 8, 12, 15]`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Explanation: No pairs satisfy both conditions.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `n = 9, x = 4, y = 10, a = [14, 10, 2, 2, 11, 11, 13, 5, 6]`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Explanation: Pair \((2, 6)\) is beautiful.

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `n = 9, x = 5, y = 6, a = [10, 7, 6, 7, 9, 7, 7, 10, 10]`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Explanation: Pairs \((2, 6)\), \((2, 8)\), and \((6, 8)\) are beautiful.

#### Test Case 5:
- Input: `n = 9, x = 6, y = 2, a = [4, 9, 7, 1, 2, 2, 13, 3, 15]`
- Expected Output: `5`
- Explanation: Pairs \((1, 3)\), \((1, 5)\), \((3, 5)\), \((3, 7)\), and \((5, 7)\) are beautiful.

#### Test Case 6:
- Input: `n = 9, x = 2, y = 3, a = [14, 6, 1, 15, 12, 15, 8, 2, 15]`
- Expected Output: `7`
- Explanation: Pairs \((1, 3)\), \((1, 5)\), \((1, 7)\), \((3, 5)\), \((3, 7)\), \((5, 7)\), and \((7, 9)\) are beautiful.

#### Test Case 7:
- Input: `n = 10, x = 5, y = 7, a = [13, 3, 3, 2, 12, 11, 3, 7, 13, 14]`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Explanation: No pairs satisfy both conditions.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and testing it with various cases, it appears to correctly implement the logic to find beautiful pairs according to the problem description. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that the program fails to handle.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
