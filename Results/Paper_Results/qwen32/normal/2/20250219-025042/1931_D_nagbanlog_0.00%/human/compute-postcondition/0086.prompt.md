Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    print(
        f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
        )
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `num` is the first element of `a`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `num` is the next element of `a` if it exists, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
