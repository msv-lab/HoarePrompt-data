The code snippet updates the value of `mod_x` by calculating the modulus of `num` with `x`. This means `mod_x` now holds the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `mod_x`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `n % y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `a`**. 

In natural language: The value of `mod_x` is updated to be the remainder of `num` divided by `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
