The given code snippet assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is the assignment of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are taken from `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary where the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` has been incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in the list `a` after the previously processed element, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**
