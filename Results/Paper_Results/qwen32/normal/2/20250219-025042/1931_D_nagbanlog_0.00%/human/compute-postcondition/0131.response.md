To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `test_cases`: A list containing at least one test case.
- `results`: A list that contains the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`.
- `case`: The next test case in `test_cases`.
- `n`: The first parameter of the current test case, accessed via `case['params'][0]`.
- `x`: The second parameter of the current test case, accessed via `case['params'][1]`.
- `y`: The third parameter of the current test case, accessed via `case['params'][2]`.
- `a`: The array associated with the current test case, accessed via `case['array']`.
- `freq`: A dictionary that keeps track of the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered during the loop.
- `beautiful_count`: The total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the loop.

### Code Snippet:

```python
print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
```

### Analysis:

The `print` statement is formatting a string to include the value of `beautiful_count`. The value of `beautiful_count` is determined by the logic within the loop that processes each test case. Since the exact logic of the loop isn't provided, we can only describe `beautiful_count` based on the context given.

`beautiful_count` is the count of pairs in the array `a` that meet some criteria related to their modulo values with `x` and `y`. The exact count depends on the specific values of `a`, `x`, and `y` for the current test case.

### Final Output Description:

Given the information, the `print` statement will output the `beautiful_count` for the current test case being processed.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where beautiful_count is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found during the processing of the current test case)**
