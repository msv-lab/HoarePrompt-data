The provided code snippet only initializes an empty list named `results`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `a`) are modified by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the introduction of the new variable `results`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, x, and y where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a list a of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `results` is an empty list.**
