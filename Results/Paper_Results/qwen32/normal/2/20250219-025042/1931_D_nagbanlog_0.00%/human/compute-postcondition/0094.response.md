To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and identify the values of the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This indicates the total number of test cases but does not directly affect the current print statement.
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case. Each test case is a dictionary with keys `params` and `array`.
- `results` is a list that contains the `beautiful_count` from the last processed test case and the newly appended `beautiful_count`. This list is not directly used in the current print statement.
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`. This means `case` is a dictionary with keys `params` and `array`.
- `n` is `case['params'][0]`, which is the first parameter of the current test case.
- `x` is `case['params'][1]`, which is the second parameter of the current test case.
- `y` is `case['params'][2]`, which is the third parameter of the current test case.
- `a` is `case['array']`, which is the array associated with the current test case.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary. This dictionary is not used in the current print statement.
- `beautiful_count` is 0. This variable is not used in the current print statement.

Given this information, the print statement is:
```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

This statement will print a formatted string that includes the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` from the current test case.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a] (where n is the first parameter of the current test case, x is the second parameter of the current test case, y is the third parameter of the current test case, and array is the array associated with the current test case)**
