The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state does not specify any values for `n`, `m`, or `k`, so these variables are now assigned based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
