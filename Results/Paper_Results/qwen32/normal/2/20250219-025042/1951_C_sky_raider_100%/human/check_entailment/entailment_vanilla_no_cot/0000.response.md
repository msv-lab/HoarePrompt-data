Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue is that it sorts the list of ticket prices and then greedily buys the minimum of `m` or `k` tickets on each day, which does not account for the increasing prices due to previous purchases. This greedy approach can lead to suboptimal solutions because it doesn't consider future price increases when making purchasing decisions.

To solve this problem correctly, a dynamic programming approach or a more sophisticated greedy strategy that takes into account the future price increases would be necessary. The current implementation fails to handle these constraints properly, leading to incorrect results in many cases.
