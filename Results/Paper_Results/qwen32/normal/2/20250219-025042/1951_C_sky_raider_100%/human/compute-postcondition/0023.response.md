To determine the output of the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the formula for `c`.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is defined as `n * s_final`.
2. `c` is defined as `s_final * (sum(l[0:n]) + (n-1) * s_final)`.
3. `k` is defined as `k - n * s_final`.

### Analysis:
- `n` and `s_final` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so they remain as variables.
- `l` is a list, but its contents are not specified, so `sum(l[0:n])` remains as the sum of the first `n` elements of the list `l`.
- `c` is calculated using the formula `s_final * (sum(l[0:n]) + (n-1) * s_final)`.

### Calculation of `c`:
- `sum(l[0:n])` is the sum of the first `n` elements of the list `l`.
- `(n-1) * s_final` is a product of `(n-1)` and `s_final`.
- Adding these two results together and multiplying by `s_final` gives us the value of `c`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `n`, `s_final`, and the contents of `l` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `c`. However, we can describe the expression for `c` precisely.

Output: **c (where c is s_final * (sum(l[0:n]) + (n-1) * s_final))**
