### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided solution and its annotations to ensure its correctness. Here's a detailed analysis:

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to buy `k` tickets over `n` days.
- Each day, we can buy up to `m` tickets.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.
- Our goal is to minimize the total cost of buying `k` tickets.

#### Solution Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input:** The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices `l`.
2. **Sorting Prices:** The list of prices `l` is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Buying Tickets:** The program iterates through the sorted list of prices:
   - For each day, it determines the number of tickets to buy (`s`), which is the minimum of `m` and the remaining number of tickets `k`.
   - It calculates the cost of these tickets, taking into account the price increase (`t`).
   - It updates the total cost (`c`), the price increase (`t`), and the remaining number of tickets (`k`).
4. **Output:** The program prints the total cost for each test case.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Sorting Prices:** Sorting the prices ensures that we always buy the cheapest available tickets first, which is a greedy strategy that helps minimize the total cost.
- **Buying Tickets:** By buying up to `m` tickets each day, the program respects the constraint on the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day.
- **Price Increase:** The price increase is correctly applied by adding the number of tickets bought on the current day to the price increase for subsequent days.
- **Termination:** The loop terminates when all `k` tickets are bought.

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm that the variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are correctly updated throughout the execution of the loop. Specifically:
- `t` accumulates the total number of tickets bought so far, which affects the price increase for subsequent days.
- `s` is the number of tickets bought on the current day, which is the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets `k`.
- `c` accumulates the total cost, which includes the price increase.

#### Example Validation:
Let's validate the solution using the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `4 2 3`, `8 6 4 2`
   - Sorted Prices: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
   - Day 1: Buy 0 tickets, `c = 0`, `t = 0`, `k = 3`
   - Day 2: Buy 0 tickets, `c = 0`, `t = 0`, `k = 3`
   - Day 3: Buy 1 ticket, `c = 4`, `t = 1`, `k = 2`
   - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets, `c = 4 + 2*(2+1) = 10`, `t = 3`, `k = 0`
   - Output: `10`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `4 2 8`, `8 6 4 2`
   - Sorted Prices: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
   - Day 1: Buy 2 tickets, `c = 2*2 = 4`, `t = 2`, `k = 6`
   - Day 2: Buy 2 tickets, `c = 4 + 2*(4+2) = 16`, `t = 4`, `k = 4`
   - Day 3: Buy 2 tickets, `c = 16 + 2*(6+4) = 32`, `t = 6`, `k = 2`
   - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets, `c = 32 + 2*(8+6) = 64`, `t = 8`, `k = 0`
   - Output: `64`

Both examples match the expected outputs, confirming the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. The annotations support this conclusion by showing the correct state of variables throughout the execution.

Final: **True**
