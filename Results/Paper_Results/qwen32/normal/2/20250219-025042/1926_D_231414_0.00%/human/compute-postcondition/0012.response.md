The given Python code snippet decrements the value of the variable `ans` by 1. 

Given the Initial State:
- `times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the input integer
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31
- `check` is 2147483647
- `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least one element
- `dic` is a dictionary that contains `s` as a key with its value decreased by 1
- `ans` is `n`
- `s` is `i ^ 2147483647`

The only change made by the code is the decrement of `ans`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be `n - 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`times` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `check` is 2147483647, `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least one element, `dic` is a dictionary that contains `s` as a key with its value decreased by 1, `ans` is `n - 1`, `s` is `i ^ 2147483647`.**
