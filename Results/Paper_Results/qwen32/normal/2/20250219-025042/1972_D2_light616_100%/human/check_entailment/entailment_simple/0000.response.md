### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(b \cdot \text{gcd}(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - Reads the values of `n` and `m` for a test case.
  - Initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` (count of valid pairs) to 0.
  - Iterates through possible values of `x` from 1 up to the square root of `n`.
  - For each `x`, iterates through possible values of `y` starting from 1.
  - Checks if `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` to ensure the constraints are satisfied.
  - If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. This part is crucial because it counts how many multiples of `(x + y) * x` fit within `n` and how many multiples of `(x + y) * y` fit within `m`, taking the smaller count as the valid pairs.
  - Prints the count of valid pairs for the current test case.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
The logic in `func_1` seems to be based on the idea of counting pairs where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and ensuring the condition \(b \cdot \text{gcd}(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) is met by iterating through potential pairs and checking constraints. However, there are some issues with this approach:

1. **Iterating Only Up to Square Root of `n`:** The loop runs only up to the square root of `n`. This means it does not consider all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges. For example, if `n` is large, pairs where `a` and `b` are both larger than the square root of `n` are not considered.

2. **Counting Valid Pairs:** The way valid pairs are counted using `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` might not correctly account for all valid pairs, especially when `gcd(x, y) != 1`.

Given these points, the program does not seem to correctly implement the required logic to find all valid pairs (a, b) for all test cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs within the given constraints.

**Correctness: False**
