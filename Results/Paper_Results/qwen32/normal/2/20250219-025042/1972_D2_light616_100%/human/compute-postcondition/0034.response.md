The code increments the value of `y` by 1. Given the initial state, `y` was 3, so now `y` becomes 4. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is increased by 1, `n` must be at least `(x + 3) * x`, `y` is 4, `m` must be at least `(x + 3) * 3`. If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented by at least 1.**
