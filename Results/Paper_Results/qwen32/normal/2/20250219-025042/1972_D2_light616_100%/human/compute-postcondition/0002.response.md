To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function definition is not provided, we can only infer that `func_1()` might modify the state of the program in some way, but without its definition, we cannot specify exactly how `t` or any other variables are affected.

However, based on the given information, we can assume that `func_1()` does not modify `t` unless explicitly stated otherwise. Therefore, the output state would reflect the same initial state for `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `t` must be at least 1.**
