To determine the output state, we need to know what `func_1()` does. Since the function definition is not provided, we can only assume that `func_1()` could potentially modify the variable `t` or introduce new variables. However, based on the given information, we cannot infer any changes to `t` or any other variables unless explicitly stated.

Given the lack of details about `func_1()`, we must assume that `func_1()` does not affect the variable `t` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 1**.
