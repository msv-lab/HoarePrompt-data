Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is reassigned the value of the user's input, which is converted to an integer. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10,000 remains valid, but now `t` holds the specific value provided by the user's input.
