To determine the new value of `cnt` after executing the given code, we need to evaluate the expression `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` and add it to the current value of `cnt`.

Given:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 12.
- `x` is 1.
- `y` is 3.
- `cnt` is calculated based on the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y`. Since `gcd(1, 3) = 1`, `cnt` is initially `min(n // 2, m // 2) + min(n // 3, m // 6)`.

First, let's compute the initial value of `cnt`:
- `min(n // 2, m // 2)` and `min(n // 3, m // 6)` need to be evaluated.
- Since `x` and `y` are 1 and 3 respectively, and their gcd is 1, we use the full formula for `cnt`.

Next, we evaluate the new part of `cnt`:
- `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` translates to `min(n // (4 * 1), m // (4 * 3))` which simplifies to `min(n // 4, m // 12)`.

Finally, we add this result to the initial `cnt`.

Let's put this into the output state format:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 12, `x` is 1, `y` is 3, `cnt` is `min(n // 2, m // 2) + min(n // 3, m // 6) + min(n // 4, m // 12)`**

This output state reflects the updated value of `cnt` after the code execution, while keeping the other conditions and variable values unchanged.
