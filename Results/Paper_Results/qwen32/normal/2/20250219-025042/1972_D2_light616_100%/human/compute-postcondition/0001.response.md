In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. 

Let's analyze the loop head: `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`.

Given that `t` is already described as an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, no adjustment is actually needed to ensure the loop executes because `t` is guaranteed to be within this range.

However, to strictly adhere to the requirement of specifying the state, we can confirm that `t` should be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `t` must be at least 1**.
