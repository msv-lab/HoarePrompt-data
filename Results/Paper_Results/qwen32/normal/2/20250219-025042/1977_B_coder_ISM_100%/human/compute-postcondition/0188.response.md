Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' based on whether the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is set or not. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` was originally '0', then `s[i]` is now '1'. `nalla` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `x` remains an input integer. `flag` is 0. Additionally, `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is '1', and `s[i + 1]` is '1'.**
