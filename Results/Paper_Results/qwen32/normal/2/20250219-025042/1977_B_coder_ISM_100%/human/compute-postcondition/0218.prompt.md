Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list `s` contains 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' based on whether the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is set or not. `nalla` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `x` remains an input integer. `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The list `s` contains 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' based on whether the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is set or not. If `flag` was originally 0 and `s[i]` was '1' and equal to `s[i + 1]`, then `s[i]` is now '-1', `flag` is set to 1, and `s[i + 1]` remains '1'. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, `s[i]` is set to '0', `flag` remains 1, and `nalla` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `flag` was 0 and either `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]` or `s[i]` is not '1', `s` retains its original values, `flag` remains 0, and `nalla` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `x` remains an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1. If `flag` is `0` and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` and both are `'1'`, then `s[i]` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to `1`. Otherwise, if `flag` is `True` and `s[i]` is `'0'`, then `s[i]` is set to `'1'` and `flag` is set to `0`. Otherwise, `flag` retains its original value and `s[i]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 28. If `flag` is 1 and `s[28]` is `'0'`, then `flag` becomes 0 and `s[28]` changes to `'1'`. If `flag` is 0 and `s[28]` is `'1'` and `s[29]` is `'1'`, then `flag` remains 1 and `s[28]` remains `'1'`. Otherwise, there is no change to the values of `flag` or `s[28]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
