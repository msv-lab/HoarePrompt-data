To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `length`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `length` must be greater than 1.
- The condition inside the loop modifies `s[i]` based on specific conditions involving `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]`.

From the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, length):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know that `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `length - 1`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` was some value, let's call it `i_prev`.
- `length` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should now be `i_prev + 1`.
- `length` must still be greater than 1 to allow the loop to continue.

Since the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `length`) can be adjusted, we don't need to consider the state of `s` or any other variables outside the loop head.

Therefore, if `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `i_prev + 1` at the start of the next iteration. The condition `length > 1` must still hold.

State: **`length` must be greater than 1, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**

However, since we don't have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it to say that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

So the final state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`length` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
