Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'`; `length` is 30; `flag` is either 0 or 1; `i` is 28. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is `'0'`, then the element at index 28 in `s` is changed to `'1'` and `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, `s` and `flag` remain unchanged.**
