Postcondition: **The list `s` will have at most one '-1', with the rest of the elements being either '0' or '1'. The variable `flag` is not 0. Additionally, `s[29]` can be '0', '1', or '-1' since the condition `if (flag)` is true, and the initial constraint on `s[29]` is no longer relevant given that `flag` is not 0.**
