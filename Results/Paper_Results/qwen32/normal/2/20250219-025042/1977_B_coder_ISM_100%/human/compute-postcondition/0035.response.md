Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'`; `length` is 30; `flag` is either 0 or 1. If `flag` was 0 and `s[i]` was `'1'` and `s[i + 1]` was also `'1'`, then `s[i]` is changed to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, then `s[i]` is specifically set to `'0'`. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not `'1'`.**
