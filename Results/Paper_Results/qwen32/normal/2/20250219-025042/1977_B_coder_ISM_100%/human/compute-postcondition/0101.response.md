Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `x` is a new integer read from the input; `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each either `'1'` or `'0'`, representing the binary representation of `x` from the least significant bit to the 30th bit; `flag` is 0; `length` is 30; `nalla` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The variable `flag` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values, except `nalla`, which has been incremented by 1.
