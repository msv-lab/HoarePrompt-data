Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' based on whether the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is set or not. If `flag` was originally 0 and `s[i]` was '1' and equal to `s[i + 1]`, then `s[i]` is now '-1', `flag` is set to 1, and `s[i + 1]` remains '1'. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, `s[i]` is set to '0', `flag` remains 1, and `nalla` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `flag` was 0 and either `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]` or `s[i]` is not '1', `s` retains its original values, `flag` remains 0, and `nalla` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. `x` remains an input integer.**
