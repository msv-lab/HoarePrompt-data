The code snippet assigns the value `'-1'` to `s[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and `s[i]` is `'0'`, it follows that `s[i - 1]` is now `'-1'`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`length` must be greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `s[i]` is `'0'`, `s[i - 1]` is `'-1'`**.
