The code snippet appends a new character to the string `temp`. This character is determined by converting the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96` to a character using the `chr` function. Given that `j` is initially 2, the character appended to `temp` corresponds to `info[i][2] + 96`.

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `info[i][0] + 96`, `info[i][1] + 96`, and `info[i][2] + 96`; `j` is 2.**
This means that `temp` now includes an additional character derived from `info[i][2] + 96`. The values of `info` and `j` remain unchanged.
