The given code snippet attempts to decrement the value of `lex` by 1. However, `lex` is not defined in the initial state provided. Since `lex` is not mentioned in the initial conditions, we cannot determine its initial value. Therefore, we can only describe the effect of the operation on `lex` itself.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is [1], `j` is 2, `lex` is decreased by 1.**
