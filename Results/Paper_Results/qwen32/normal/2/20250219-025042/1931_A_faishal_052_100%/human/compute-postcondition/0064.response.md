Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is an integer decreased by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 1, `arr` is [1, 1] if `lex` was initially less than 28, `arr` is [26, 1] if `lex` was initially between 26 and 52, `arr` is [1] if `lex` was initially greater than 78.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `lex` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
