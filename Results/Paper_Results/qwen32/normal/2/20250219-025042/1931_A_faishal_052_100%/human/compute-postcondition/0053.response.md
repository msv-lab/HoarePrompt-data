Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is an input integer and its current value is less than 52, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is greater than or equal to 28.**

Natural Language: The variable `arr` now contains the value `[26]`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
