Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 2, `arr` now includes an additional element `26` at the end, `lex` is `lex - 26`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `lex` has been decreased by 26. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
