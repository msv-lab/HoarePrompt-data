Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 0, `arr` is `[26]`, `lex` is an input integer, `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, and `lex` is less than or equal to 78.**

Explanation: The array `arr` now contains the single element `26`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
