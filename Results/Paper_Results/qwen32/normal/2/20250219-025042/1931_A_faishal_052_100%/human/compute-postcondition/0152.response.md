In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of 3, meaning the loop will execute if `j` takes values from 0 to 2. The initial state provided includes `j` being set to 2, but this does not prevent the loop from executing since the loop will start with `j` being set to 0.

However, the task specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted. In this case, the loop head only involves the variable `j` and the range `3`.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(3):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute as long as the range is valid (which it is, since `range(3)` generates values 0, 1, and 2).

Since `j` is re-initialized in the loop head, its initial value outside the loop (being 2) does not affect the loop's ability to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `j` in terms of ensuring the loop can run.

The other variables (`info`, `temp`, `i`, `cases`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted according to the task requirements.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged in terms of what is necessary for the loop to execute:

State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is an empty string; `j` is 2; `i` is 4, `cases` must be greater than 4**
