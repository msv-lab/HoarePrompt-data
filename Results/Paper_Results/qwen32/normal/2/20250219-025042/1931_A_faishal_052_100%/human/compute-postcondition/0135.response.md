The code snippet concatenates a new character to the existing string `temp`. This character is determined by converting the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96` to its corresponding character using the `chr` function.

Given the initial state:
- `info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`.
- `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `info[i][j] + 96`.
- `j` is 1.

After executing the line `temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)`, the value of `temp` will be updated to include the new character derived from `info[i][j] + 96`.

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `info[i][0] + 96` and `info[i][1] + 96`; `j` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `temp` now includes an additional character based on the value of `info[i][1] + 96`, while `info` and `j` remain unchanged.
