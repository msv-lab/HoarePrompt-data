The given code snippet is `lex = lex - 26`. However, the initial state does not include a variable named `lex`. Since `lex` is not defined in the initial state, it's impossible to determine its value before the operation. Therefore, we cannot compute the exact new value of `lex` after the operation.

However, if we assume that `lex` was defined somewhere prior to this snippet and had a specific value, the operation would simply subtract 26 from that value. Given the lack of information about `lex`, we can only state that `lex` will be reduced by 26.

For the rest of the variables, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 2, `arr` contains the element 26, `lex` is reduced by 26.**
