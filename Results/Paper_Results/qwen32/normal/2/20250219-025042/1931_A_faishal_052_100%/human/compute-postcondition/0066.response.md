Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78
- `cases` is greater than 0
- `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`
- `lex` is an integer
- `i` is `i + 1`
- If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1` and `arr` is [1, 26]
- If `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 26 but less than or equal to 52, `arr` is [26, 26]
- If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `arr` remains an empty list
- `j` is 1

Code Snippet:
```
lex = lex - 26
```

Impact:
- The value of `lex` is reduced by 26.

Given the conditions on `lex` before the code snippet:
1. If `lex` was initially less than 28, it was already decremented by 1, making it less than 27. After subtracting 26, `lex` would be less than 1.
2. If `lex` was initially between 26 and 52 (inclusive), after subtracting 26, `lex` would be between 0 and 26 (inclusive).
3. If `lex` was initially greater than 78, after subtracting 26, `lex` would be greater than 52.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is `lex - 26`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is determined based on the initial value of `lex` (if `lex` was less than 28, `arr` is [1, 26]; if `lex` was between 26 and 52, `arr` is [26, 26]; if `lex` was greater than 78, `arr` is an empty list), `j` is 1.**
