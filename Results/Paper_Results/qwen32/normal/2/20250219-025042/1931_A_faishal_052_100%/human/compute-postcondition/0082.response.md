The provided loop runs exactly 2 times (as indicated by `for j in range(2)`). Therefore, the "all executions" of the loop refer to these 2 iterations. The output state after the loop executes all its iterations (which is 2 in this case) can be derived from the given output states after the first and second iterations.

Let's summarize the possible states after 2 iterations based on the initial value of `lex`:

1. **If `lex` is initially less than 28:**
   - After 1st iteration: `arr` is `[1]` and `lex` is `lex - 1`.
   - After 2nd iteration: `arr` is `[1, 1]` if `lex - 1 < 28` (i.e., `lex < 29`), otherwise `arr` is `[26, 1]`.

2. **If `lex` is initially between 28 and 52:**
   - After 1st iteration: `arr` is `[26]` and `lex` is `lex - 26`.
   - After 2nd iteration: `arr` is `[26, 26]` if `lex - 26 < 26` (i.e., `lex < 52`), otherwise `arr` is `[26, 1]`.

3. **If `lex` is initially between 52 and 78:**
   - After 1st iteration: `arr` is `[26]` and `lex` is `lex - 26`.
   - After 2nd iteration: `arr` is `[26, 26]` if `lex - 26 < 26` (i.e., `lex < 78`), otherwise `arr` is `[26, 26]` since `lex - 26` cannot be greater than 26 in this range.

4. **If `lex` is initially greater than 78:**
   - After 1st iteration: `arr` remains `[]` and `lex` remains unchanged.
   - After 2nd iteration: `arr` remains `[]` and `lex` remains unchanged.

Thus, the final output state after the loop completes its 2 iterations depends on the initial value of `lex`:

- If `lex < 29`, `arr` will be `[1, 1]` and `lex` will be `lex - 2`.
- If `29 <= lex < 52`, `arr` will be `[26, 1]` and `lex` will be `lex - 27`.
- If `52 <= lex < 78`, `arr` will be `[26, 26]` and `lex` will be `lex - 52`.
- If `lex >= 78`, `arr` will be `[]` and `lex` will remain unchanged.

Since the exact initial value of `lex` is not specified, we can't provide a single concrete output state. However, we can describe the general form of the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 2. If `lex` is less than 29, `arr` is `[1, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 2`. If `lex` is 29 or greater but less than 52, `arr` is `[26, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 27`. If `lex` is 52 or greater but less than 78, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 52`. If `lex` is 78 or greater, `arr` is `[]` and `lex` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the output state depends on the initial value of `lex` and how it changes after two iterations of the loop.
