To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variables over each iteration.

The given loop iterates over the range of 3 (from 0 to 2), and in each iteration, it appends a character to the `temp` string based on the value in the `info` list at a specific index. The loop specifically uses `info[i][j]`, where `i` is fixed at 4 and `j` ranges from 0 to 2.

Here's the breakdown of the loop iterations:
- **First Iteration (j=0)**: `temp` becomes `chr(info[4][0] + 96)`
- **Second Iteration (j=1)**: `temp` becomes `chr(info[4][0] + 96) + chr(info[4][1] + 96)`
- **Third Iteration (j=2)**: `temp` becomes `chr(info[4][0] + 96) + chr(info[4][1] + 96) + chr(info[4][2] + 96)`

Since the loop runs for `j` in the range of 3, it will execute exactly 3 times as per the given code. Therefore, the final value of `temp` will be the concatenation of the characters derived from `info[4][0]`, `info[4][1]`, and `info[4][2]`.

The values of `i` and `j` after the loop completes will be `i = 4` and `j = 3` because `j` will have completed its last iteration with a value of 2 and then incremented to 3, causing the loop to terminate.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is `chr(info[4][0] + 96) + chr(info[4][1] + 96) + chr(info[4][2] + 96)`; `j` is 3; `i` is 4; `cases` must be greater than 4.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, the `temp` string will contain three characters corresponding to the ASCII values derived from the first three elements of the array at index 4 in the `info` list, shifted by 96. The values of `i` and `j` will be 4 and 3, respectively, and `cases` will still need to be greater than 4.
