The given code attempts to append the value `26` to a list named `arr`. However, the initial state does not include any information about the existence or current state of the list `arr`. Since `arr` is not defined in the initial state, the code would raise a `NameError` in practice. But, assuming the intention was to modify an existing list `arr` and there was a typo or missing initialization, we will proceed by assuming `arr` exists and is initially empty or has some predefined state.

Given the task constraints and the assumption that `arr` exists, the only variable that changes is `arr` itself. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `cases`, `info`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 2, `arr` is a list containing the element 26.**
