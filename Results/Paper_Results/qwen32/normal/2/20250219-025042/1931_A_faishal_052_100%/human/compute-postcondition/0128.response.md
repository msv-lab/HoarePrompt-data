To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider how the loop processes the input and modifies the `info` list based on the provided conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
   - `cases` is the number of iterations the loop will perform, and it is greater than 0.
   - `info` is initially an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration (from 0 to `cases-1`), the following happens:
     - An empty list `arr` is initialized.
     - `lex` is read from the input.
     - The inner loop runs twice (`for j in range(2)`):
       - If `lex < 28`, append `1` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by `1`.
       - If `28 ≤ lex < 52`, append `26` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by `26`.
       - If `52 ≤ lex ≤ 78`, append `26` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by `26`.
     - After the inner loop, append the remaining `lex` to `arr`.
     - Sort `arr` in non-decreasing order.
     - Append the sorted `arr` to `info`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `info` will contain `cases` number of sorted lists, each representing the processed values of `lex` according to the specified rules.

Given the pattern observed in the first three iterations, we can generalize that after all iterations, `info` will contain `cases` number of sorted lists, each derived from the corresponding `lex` values.

**Output State**: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted lists, each derived from the corresponding `lex` values according to the specified rules.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the `info` list will have `cases` sorted sublists where each sublist represents the processed `lex` value according to the given conditions. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `cases` indicates how many such sublists are present in `info`.
