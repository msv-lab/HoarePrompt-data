Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `lex` is an input integer less than 28 and now `lex` is `lex - 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is [1].**

In simple terms, the value of `lex` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
