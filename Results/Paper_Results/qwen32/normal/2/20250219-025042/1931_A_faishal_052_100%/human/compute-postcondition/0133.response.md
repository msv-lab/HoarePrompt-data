The code snippet concatenates a character to the `temp` string based on the value of `info[i][j]`. Specifically, it adds the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`.

Given that `info` contains sorted arrays and `j` is initialized to 0, `info[i][j]` refers to the first element of the `i`-th array in `info`. Since `info[i][j]` is an integer (as it's part of a sorted array), adding 96 to it and converting it to a character using `chr()` will yield a lowercase letter (assuming `info[i][j]` is between 1 and 26).

Thus, the `temp` string will now contain the character corresponding to the position of `info[i][j]` in the alphabet.

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`, where each `arr` is constructed based on the input `lex` values read during each iteration of the loop, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1; `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `info[i][j] + 96`; `j` is 0**.
