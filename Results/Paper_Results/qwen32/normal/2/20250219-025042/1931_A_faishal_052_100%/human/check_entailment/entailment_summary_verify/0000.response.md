### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n` (where `3 ≤ n ≤ 78`).
- Each letter in the word corresponds to a position in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' = 1, 'b' = 2, ..., 'z' = 26).

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n`. It then attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums to `n`.

Here is the program again for reference:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)

func()
```

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic for Constructing the Word:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the construction of the word. Specifically, it tries to fill the first two positions with either 1 or 26 based on the value of `lex`, and then assigns the remaining value to the third position.
   - This approach does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word. For example, if `lex` is 27, the program will assign `[26, 1, 1]` instead of `[1, 1, 25]`, which is lexicographically smaller.

2. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting the array `arr` after assigning values ensures that the smallest possible values come first, but the initial assignment logic is flawed.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the input `n = 27`. The program will output `bza` (since it assigns `[26, 1, 1]` and sorts it to `[1, 1, 26]` which translates to `bza`). However, the correct output should be `aaa` because `1 + 1 + 25 = 27` and `aaa` is lexicographically smaller than `bza`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly when constructing the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect due to the flawed logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest word.

Final: **False**
