The code snippet appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. This means that the length of `arr` increases by one, and the last element of `arr` is now `lex`.

Given the initial state, `arr` already contains some elements (as it is part of the `info` which includes the original `arr` and the new `arr`). After appending `lex`, the new `arr` will have `lex` as its last element.

Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr` with `lex` appended, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 2, `arr` has `lex` appended to it.**

In simpler terms, the list `arr` now includes `lex` as its last element, and all other variables retain their initial values.
