To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and how many times it will run. The loop is defined as:

```python
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
```

This loop runs exactly twice because `j` ranges from 0 to 1. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly two times regardless of the initial value of `lex`.

Let's summarize the changes based on the initial conditions and the behavior of the loop:

1. **First Iteration (`j = 0`)**:
   - If `lex < 28`, append `1` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by `1`.
   - If `28 <= lex < 52`, append `26` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by `26`.
   - If `52 <= lex <= 78`, append `26` to `arr` and decrement `lex` by `26`.

2. **Second Iteration (`j = 1`)**:
   - Apply the same logic as the first iteration to the updated `lex` and `arr`.

After these two iterations, the final state of `arr` and `lex` can be determined based on the initial value of `lex`.

### Final Output State:
- **If `lex < 28` initially**:
  - After the first iteration, `arr` becomes `[1]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 1`.
  - After the second iteration, `arr` becomes `[1, 1]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 2`.

- **If `28 <= lex < 52` initially**:
  - After the first iteration, `arr` becomes `[26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 26`.
  - After the second iteration, `arr` becomes `[26, 1]` if `lex - 26 < 28`; otherwise, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 52`.

- **If `52 <= lex <= 78` initially**:
  - After the first iteration, `arr` becomes `[26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 26`.
  - After the second iteration, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 52`.

- **If `lex > 78` initially**:
  - After the first iteration, `arr` remains `[]` and `lex` remains unchanged.
  - After the second iteration, `arr` remains `[]` and `lex` remains unchanged.

Given that the loop runs exactly twice, the final state of `arr` and `lex` depends on the initial value of `lex`. However, the structure of the loop ensures that after two iterations, the value of `j` will be `2`, and the loop will terminate.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 2. The final `arr` and `lex` depend on the initial value of `lex` as described above.**

In natural language, after the loop completes its two iterations, the variable `j` will be `2`, and the array `arr` and the value of `lex` will be updated based on the rules provided for each iteration. The specific values of `arr` and `lex` depend on their initial values before the loop started.
