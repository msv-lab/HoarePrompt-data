The code snippet concatenates a new character to the string `temp`. This character is derived from the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3 and `j` is 1, so the character added to `temp` is `chr(info[3][1] + 96)`. 

The other variables (`info`, `cases`, `j`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`info` is a list containing `cases` number of sorted arrays `arr`; `temp` is a string containing the characters `chr(info[3][0] + 96)` and `chr(info[3][1] + 96)`; `j` is 1; `i` is 3, `cases` must be greater than 3.**
