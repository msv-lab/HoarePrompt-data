Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`. If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, `arr` has `26` appended to it, `lex` is decreased by `26`, `i` is `i + 2`, and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged, and `lex` remains unchanged.**
