Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 2, `arr` is sorted as follows: if `lex < 29`, `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 2]`; if `29 <= lex < 52`, `arr` is `[1, 26, lex - 27]`; if `52 <= lex < 78`, `arr` is `[26, 26, lex - 52]`; if `lex >= 78`, `arr` is `[lex]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `info` list now includes the original `arr` followed by the newly appended `arr`. All other variables retain their initial values.
