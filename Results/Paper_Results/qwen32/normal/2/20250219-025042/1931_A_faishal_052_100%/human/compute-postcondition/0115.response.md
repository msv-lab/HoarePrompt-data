The code appends the value `1` to the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `cases`, `info`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 2, `arr` has an additional element `1` appended to it.**
