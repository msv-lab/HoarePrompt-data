Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78; cases is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `cases` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the integer value provided by the user input. The preconditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
