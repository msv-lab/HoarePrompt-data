The code appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Given the initial conditions, the list `arr` could have been initially empty, contained the integer 1, or contained the integer 26. After appending 26, the new state of `arr` will be:

- If `lex` was initially less than 28, `arr` was [1] and now it becomes [1, 26].
- If `lex` was initially between 28 and 51, `arr` was [26] and now it becomes [26, 26].
- If `lex` was initially 52 or more, `arr` was [] and now it becomes [26].

The values of `t`, `n`, `cases`, `info`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is [1, 26] if lex was initially less than 28, `arr` is [26, 26] if lex was initially between 28 and 51, `arr` is [26] if lex was initially 52 or more, `j` is 1**.
