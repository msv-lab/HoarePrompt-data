The code snippet appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. This means that the length of `arr` increases by one, and the last element of `arr` is now `26`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 2, `arr` has an additional element `26` appended to it.**
