Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is greater than 0, `info` contains the value of `lex` followed by the original `arr` and then the new `arr`, `i` is `i + 2`, `j` is 0, `arr` is `[1]`, `lex` is an input integer and `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is now `lex - 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `lex` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
