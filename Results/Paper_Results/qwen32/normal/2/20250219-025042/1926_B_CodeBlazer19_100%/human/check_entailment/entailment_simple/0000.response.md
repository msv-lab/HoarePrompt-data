### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Triangle**: 
   - Consists of `k` (where `k > 1`) consecutive rows.
   - The `i-th` row has `2*i - 1` consecutive `1`s.
   - Central `1`s are aligned in one column.
   - Upside-down triangles are also valid.

2. **Square**:
   - Consists of `k` (where `k > 1`) consecutive rows.
   - Each row has `k` consecutive `1`s.
   - `1`s are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to distinguish between a triangle and a square based on the given criteria. Hereâ€™s why:

- The program checks each row for the count of `1`s:
  - If a row has exactly one `1`, it sets `a` to `'TRIANGLE'`.
  - If a row has more than one `1`, it sets `b` to `'SQUARE'`.

- The program then prints `'TRIANGLE'` if `a` is not zero, otherwise it prints `'SQUARE'`.

However, this approach is flawed because:
- It doesn't account for the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square.
- It doesn't check for the alignment of `1`s in columns or rows as per the problem statement.
- It doesn't handle the upside-down triangles correctly.

#### Example Issues:
- For a triangle, the program might incorrectly identify it as a square if any row has more than one `1`.
- For a square, the program might incorrectly identify it as a triangle if any row has exactly one `1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square based on the problem's criteria. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
