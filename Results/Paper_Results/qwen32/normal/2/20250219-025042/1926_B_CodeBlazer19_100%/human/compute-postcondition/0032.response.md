The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10; the grid is an n x n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if there was at least one line with exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0; `b` is 'SQUARE'; `j` is n - 1; `s` is the last input string.**
