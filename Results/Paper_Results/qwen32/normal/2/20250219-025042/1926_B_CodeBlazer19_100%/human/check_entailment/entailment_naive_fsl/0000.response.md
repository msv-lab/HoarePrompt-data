Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Triangle Cases**: The program only checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle. However, a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, especially in the middle rows. For example, a triangle with `k=3` would look like this:
   ```
   00100
   01110
   11111
   ```
   In this case, the second row has three '1's, and the third row has five '1's. The program would incorrectly identify this as a square because it sees more than one '1' in these rows.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Square Cases**: Similarly, the program only checks if a row contains more than one '1' to determine if the shape is a square. However, this check is not sufficient. For example, consider a triangle with `k=4`:
   ```
   0001000
   0011100
   0111110
   1111111
   ```
   Here, the first row has one '1', the second row has three '1's, and so on. The program would incorrectly identify this as a square because it sees more than one '1' in the second and subsequent rows.

3. **No Proper Logic for Shape Detection**: The program lacks any logic to properly detect the specific patterns of '1's that define a triangle or a square. It simply checks the number of '1's in each row and makes a decision based on that, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to implement logic that checks for the specific patterns of '1's that define a triangle or a square, considering the constraints and definitions provided in the problem description.
