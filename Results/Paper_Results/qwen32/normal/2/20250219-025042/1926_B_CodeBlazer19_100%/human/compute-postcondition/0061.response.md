Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- `i`: Initialized to 1.
- `n`: An integer between 2 and 10.
- `grid`: An `n x n` list of strings where each string consists of `n` characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's, and the size of this shape is greater than 1.
- `a`: Initialized to 0.
- `b`: Set to 'SQUARE' if the grid contains exactly one square, otherwise set to an empty string.
- `j`: Set to `n`.
- `s`: The last input string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b)
```

### Analysis:
The variable `b` is the key here. According to the initial state, `b` is assigned the value 'SQUARE' if the grid contains exactly one square, otherwise it is assigned an empty string. Since the problem states that the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square, and we need to determine the value of `b`, we must consider the following:

- If the grid contains exactly one square, `b` will be 'SQUARE'.
- If the grid contains exactly one triangle, `b` will be an empty string.

However, since the problem specifies that the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square, and `b` is only set to 'SQUARE' if the grid contains exactly one square, we need to consider both possibilities.

Given the problem constraints, `b` could be either 'SQUARE' or an empty string depending on the shape in the grid. But based on the information provided, we can only definitively say that `b` is 'SQUARE' if the grid contains a square, and an empty string if it contains a triangle.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact shape in the grid is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the possible values of `b` based on the conditions provided.

Output: **b (where b is 'SQUARE' if the grid contains exactly one square, otherwise b is '')**
