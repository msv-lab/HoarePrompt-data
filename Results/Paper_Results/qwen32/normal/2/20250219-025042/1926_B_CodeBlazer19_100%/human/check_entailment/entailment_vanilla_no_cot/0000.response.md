Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape formed by the '1's in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here are some issues with the code:

1. The variable `a` is initialized to `0` and then set to the string `'TRIANGLE'` if any row contains exactly one '1'. This logic is incorrect because a triangle can have multiple rows with different numbers of '1's, not just one row with exactly one '1'.

2. The variable `b` is set to `'SQUARE'` if any row contains more than one '1'. This is also incorrect because a square requires every row with '1's to have the same number of '1's, and they must be aligned in a specific way.

3. The program prints `'TRIANGLE'` if `a` is not `0`, otherwise it prints `'SQUARE'`. This logic does not properly check the conditions for either a triangle or a square.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Check if the shape is a square by verifying that there are `k` consecutive rows with `k` consecutive '1's starting from the same column.
- Check if the shape is a triangle by verifying that there are `k` consecutive rows with `2*i - 1` consecutive '1's centered around a single column, both for upright and upside-down triangles.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_square(grid, n):
    # Find the first row with '1's
    start_row = None
    for i in range(n):
        if '1' in grid[i]:
            start_row = i
            break
    if start_row is None:
        return False
    
    # Determine the size of the square
    k = grid[start_row].count('1')
    if k <= 1:
        return False
    
    # Check if the next k-1 rows also have k '1's in the same positions
    for i in range(start_row + 1, start_row + k):
        if i >= n or grid[i].count('1') != k:
            return False
        if grid[i] != grid[start_row]:
            return False
    
    return True

def is_triangle(grid, n):
    # Find the first row with '1's
    start_row = None
    for i in range(n):
        if '1' in grid[i]:
            start_row = i
            break
    if start_row is None:
        return False
    
    # Determine the size of the triangle
    k = grid[start_row].count('1')
    if k <= 1:
        return False
    
    # Check if the next k-1 rows form a triangle
    for i in range(start_row + 1, start_row + k):
        if i >= n:
            return False
        current_row = grid[i]
        count_ones = current_row.count('1')
        if count_ones != 2 * (i - start_row) - 1:
            return False
        # Check if '1's are centered
        first_one = current_row.find('1')
        last_one = current_row.rfind('1')
        if first_one + last_one != count_ones - 1:
            return False
    
    # Check for upside-down triangle
    start_row = None
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if '1' in grid[i]:
            start_row = i
            break
    if start_row is None:
        return False
    
    k = grid[start_row].count('1')
    if k <= 1:
        return False
    
    for i in range(start_row - 1, start_row - k, -1):
        if i < 0:
            return False
        current_row = grid[i]
        count_ones = current_row.count('1')
        if count_ones != 2 * (start_row - i) - 1:
            return False
        first_one = current_row.find('1')
        last_one = current_row.rfind('1')
        if first_one + last_one != count_ones - 1:
            return False
    
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        if is_square(grid, n):
            print("SQUARE")
        elif is_triangle(grid, n):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            print("UNKNOWN")  # This line should never be reached based on problem constraints

func()
```

This program correctly identifies whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the given criteria.
