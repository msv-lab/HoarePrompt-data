The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10; the grid is an n x n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0; `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is ''; `j` is 1; `s` is the new input string.**
