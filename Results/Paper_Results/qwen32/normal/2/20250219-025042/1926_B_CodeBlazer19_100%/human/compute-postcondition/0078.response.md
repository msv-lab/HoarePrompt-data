The code snippet assigns the string `'TRIANGLE'` to the variable `a`. This means the value of `a` is now `'TRIANGLE'`, regardless of its previous value. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `i` is 2; `n` is the new input integer between 2 and 10; the grid is a new `n x n` list of strings where each string consists of `n` characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is 'TRIANGLE'; `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is ''; `j` is 1; `s` is the string input by the user.**
