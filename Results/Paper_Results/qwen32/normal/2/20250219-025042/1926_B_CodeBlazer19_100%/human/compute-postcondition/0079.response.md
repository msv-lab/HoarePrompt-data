Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `i` is 2; `n` is the new input integer between 2 and 10; the grid is a new `n x n` list of strings where each string consists of `n` characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0; `b` is 'SQUARE'; `j` is 1; `s` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The variable `b` has been explicitly set to 'SQUARE'. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
