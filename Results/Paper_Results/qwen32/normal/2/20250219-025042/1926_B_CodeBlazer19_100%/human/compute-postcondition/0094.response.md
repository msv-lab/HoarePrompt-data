To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies its variables based on the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
2. **Initialization per Iteration**: For each iteration (`i` ranging from 0 to `t-1`), `n` is read as an integer between 2 and 10. Then, an `n x n` grid of strings is read, where each string consists of `n` characters ('0' or '1').
3. **Processing the Grid**:
   - `a` is initialized to 0.
   - `b` is initialized to an empty string.
   - For each row `s` in the grid:
     - If `s.count('1') == 1`, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'.
     - If `s.count('1') > 1`, `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.
4. **Output per Iteration**:
   - If `a` is not 0 (i.e., `a` is 'TRIANGLE'), it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

After all iterations, the variables will be in their final states as follows:

- `t`: Remains the same as the initial input value.
- `i`: Will be equal to `t` (since the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`).
- `n`: Will be the value of `n` from the last iteration.
- `a`: Will be 'TRIANGLE' if the last grid contained a row with exactly one '1', otherwise 0.
- `b`: Will be 'SQUARE' if the last grid contained a row with more than one '1', otherwise an empty string.
- `j`: Will be `n-1` (since the inner loop iterates over all rows).
- `s`: Will be the last row string of the last grid.

The final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `i` is `t`; `n` is the input integer between 2 and 10 from the last iteration; the grid is an `n x n` list of strings where each string consists of `n` characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the last grid contains exactly one triangle, otherwise `a` is 0; `b` is 'SQUARE' if the last grid contains exactly one square, otherwise `b` is ''; `j` is `n-1`; `s` is the last input string from the last grid.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop will have processed `t` grids, and the final state reflects the processing of the last grid. The variable `i` will be equal to `t`, and the other variables will reflect the state after processing the last grid.
