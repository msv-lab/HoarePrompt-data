The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases, and its value is between 1 and 100 inclusive.

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, and it also describes conditions related to `n` and the grid for each test case. However, the code snippet only affects the variable `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and the grid is an n x n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.**
