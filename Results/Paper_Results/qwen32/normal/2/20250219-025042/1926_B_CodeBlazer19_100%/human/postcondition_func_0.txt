The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid of strings consisting of '0's and '1's. It then determines whether the '1's in the grid form exactly one triangle or exactly one square, with the size of the shape being greater than 1, and prints the type of shape ('TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE') for each test case.
