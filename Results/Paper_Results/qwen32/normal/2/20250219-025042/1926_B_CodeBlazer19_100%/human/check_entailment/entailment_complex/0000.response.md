### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to determine whether the '1's in a grid form a triangle or a square based on the count of '1's in each row. However, this approach is flawed and does not correctly identify the shapes as per the problem description.

Here's why:

1. **Triangle Identification**: The program sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE' if any row contains exactly one '1'. This is incorrect because a triangle can have multiple rows with different numbers of '1's, specifically following the pattern of 1, 3, 5, ..., 2*k-1 for some k > 1. The program fails to check this pattern and instead incorrectly identifies a triangle based on a single row having one '1'.

2. **Square Identification**: The program sets `b` to 'SQUARE' if any row contains more than one '1'. This is also incorrect because a square requires all rows to have the same number of '1's, and these '1's must be aligned in a specific way (equidistant from the left edge). The program does not check for these conditions.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The program uses `a` and `b` to store the result but does not correctly determine the shape. It simply checks the count of '1's in each row without verifying the overall structure of the shape.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly determine whether the '1's in the grid form a triangle or a square. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
