You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10, and the grid is an n x n list of strings where each string consists of n characters, each character being either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.

    #State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `i` is `t`; `n` is the input integer between 2 and 10 from the last iteration; the grid is an `n x n` list of strings where each string consists of `n` characters, each character being either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1; `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the last grid contains exactly one triangle, otherwise `a` is 0; `b` is 'SQUARE' if the last grid contains exactly one square, otherwise `b` is ''; `j` is `n-1`; `s` is the last input string from the last grid.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid of strings consisting of '0's and '1's. It then determines whether the '1's in the grid form exactly one triangle or exactly one square, with the size of the shape being greater than 1, and prints the type of shape ('TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE') for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to see if it correctly determines whether the shape formed by the `1`s in the grid is a square or a triangle based on the given problem description.

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid (`n`).
   - Then, it reads `n` lines of `n` characters each representing the grid.

2. **Logic for Determining Shape:**
   - The code initializes `a` to `0` and `b` to an empty string.
   - For each line in the grid, it counts the number of `1`s.
     - If there is exactly one `1` in the line, it sets `a` to `'TRIANGLE'`.
     - If there is more than one `1` in the line, it sets `b` to `'SQUARE'`.
   - After processing all lines, it checks if `a` is not `0`. If so, it prints `a` (which would be `'TRIANGLE'`). Otherwise, it prints `b` (which would be `'SQUARE'`).

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Triangle Check:**
  - The code only sets `a` to `'TRIANGLE'` if any row has exactly one `1`. However, this is not sufficient to confirm that the shape is a triangle. A triangle can have multiple rows with different numbers of `1`s, and it may not necessarily have a row with exactly one `1`.

- **Square Check:**
  - The code sets `b` to `'SQUARE'` if any row has more than one `1`. This is also not sufficient to confirm that the shape is a square. A square requires all rows to have the same number of `1`s, and these `1`s must be aligned in such a way that they form a square.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the provided code does not correctly identify whether the shape is a triangle or a square. It makes incorrect assumptions about the conditions required for a triangle and a square.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
