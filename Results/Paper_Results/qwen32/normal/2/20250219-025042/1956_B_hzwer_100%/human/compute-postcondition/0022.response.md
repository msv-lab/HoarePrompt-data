The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to `n`. However, the initial state already specifies that `n` is `t`, which is a valid integer between 2 and 10^4. Since `n` is already set to `t`, reassigning `n` to `int(input())` does not change its value because the input is expected to be the same integer `t`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`input` holds a valid integer `t` where 2 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where each `cnt[x]` represents the number of times `x` appears in the list `a`; `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.**
