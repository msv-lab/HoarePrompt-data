The code snippet `cnt[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `input` holds a valid integer `t` where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is `t`.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least two integers.
- `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where the value at index `x` is incremented by 1.
- `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` (unchanged).
- `x` is the next element in `a`.

After executing `cnt[x] += 1`, the value at index `x` in `cnt` will increase by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, and the remaining elements of `cnt` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`input` holds a valid integer `t` where 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least two integers; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where the value at index `x` is incremented by 1; `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt` (unchanged); `x` is the next element in `a`.**
