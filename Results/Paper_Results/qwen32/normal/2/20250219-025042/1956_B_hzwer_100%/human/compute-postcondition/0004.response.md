The code initializes a list `cnt` with `n + 1` zeros, where `n` is already set to the value of `t`. This means `cnt` will have `t + 1` elements, all initialized to 0.

Output State: **`input` holds a valid integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is `t`; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each part to an integer; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` zeros.**
