The code snippet `y1 -= a` subtracts the value of `a` from `y1`. Given that `a` is `0`, the value of `y1` does not change.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `abs(1 - y1)`, `r` is a list containing the single integer `abs(1 - y1)`, `n` and `m` are not assigned values, `y1` remains unchanged, `x1` remains unchanged, `x2` remains unchanged, `a` is `0`, `b` is an odd positive integer equal to `x2 - x1` before the modification, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least `1`, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. `y2` is `1`.**
