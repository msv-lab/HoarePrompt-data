The code snippet assigns the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1` to the variable `t`. Since `t` was initially defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `r` is a list containing the single integer `t`, these values remain unchanged unless explicitly modified. The variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are not assigned values in the given initial state and are not affected by the code snippet. The conditions about `x2`, `x1`, `y1`, `y2`, `a`, and `b` remain valid as well.

Given that `t` is reassigned to `abs(y2 - y1)`, the new value of `t` will be the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list containing the single integer `abs(y2 - y1)`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are not assigned values; `x2` is greater than `x1`; the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is `y1 - 1`; otherwise, `a` is `m - y1`; `b` is a positive even integer equal to `x2 - x1`.**
