Postcondition: **`t` is either `abs(y2 - 1)` or `abs(y2 - m)`, depending on whether `y1` is less than or equal to `y2` or not. `r` is a list containing the single integer `abs(y2 - 1)` if `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, otherwise it contains `abs(y2 - y1)`. `x1` is `x1 + a`, where `a` is `0` if `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, and `m - y1` if `y1` is greater than `y2`. `y1` is `1` if `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, otherwise it is `m`. `y2` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to `1` if `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, otherwise it is less than `y1`. `a` is `0` if `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, and `m - y1` if `y1` is greater than `y2`. `b` is a positive even integer equal to `x2 - x1`. `x2` is `x2` if `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, otherwise it is `x2 - a`. `c` is `y2 - 1` if `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, otherwise it is `m - y2`. `n`, `m`, `y2` are not assigned new values. `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to `1`, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. Additionally, either `b // 2 <= a` or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c` or `(y1 < 1 or y1 > m)` or `(x1 < 1 or x1 > n)`**
