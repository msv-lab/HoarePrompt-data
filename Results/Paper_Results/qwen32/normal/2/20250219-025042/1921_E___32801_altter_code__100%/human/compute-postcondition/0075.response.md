The code snippet `y2 += a` increments the value of `y2` by `a`. Given that `a` is defined as `m - y1` and `y1` is equal to `m`, `a` simplifies to `m - m`, which is `0`. Therefore, adding `a` to `y2` does not change the value of `y2`.

Thus, the only variable that would change if there were a non-zero `a` remains unchanged because `a` is `0`.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - m)`, `r` is a list containing the single integer `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x1` is `x1 + a`, `y1` is equal to `m`, `y2` is less than `y1`, `a` is `m - y1`, `b` is a positive even integer equal to `x2 - x1`, `x2` is `x2 - a`, `n`, `m`, `y2` are not assigned values, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.**
