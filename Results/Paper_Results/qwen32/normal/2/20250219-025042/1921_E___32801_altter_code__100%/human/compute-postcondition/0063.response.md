The code increments `x1` by the value of `a`. Given the conditions, `a` is either `y1 - 1` or `m - y1` depending on whether `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list containing the single integer `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x1` is `x1 + a`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is `y1 - 1`; otherwise, `a` is `m - y1`; `b` is a positive even integer equal to `x2 - x1`; `x2` is greater than `x1`; the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even; `n`, `m`, `x2`, and `y2` are not assigned values.**
