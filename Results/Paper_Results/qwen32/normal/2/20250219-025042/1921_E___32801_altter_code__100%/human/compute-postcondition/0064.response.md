The code snippet `x2 -= a` reduces the value of `x2` by the value of `a`. Given the initial state, `a` is either `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1`, or `m - y1` if `y2 < y1`. Since `x2` is initially greater than `x1` and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, after subtracting `a` from `x2`, `x2` will still be greater than `x1` and the difference between `x2` and `x1` will remain even.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list containing the single integer `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x1` is `x1 + a`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is `y1 - 1`; otherwise, `a` is `m - y1`; `b` is a positive even integer equal to `x2 - x1`; `x2` is `x2 - a`; `n`, `m`, `y2` are not assigned values.**
