The `print('draw')` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, or `y2`. The string `'draw'` is explicitly provided within the `print` function.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'draw'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
