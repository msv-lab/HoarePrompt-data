### Reasoning:

The provided Python code attempts to solve the problem by processing each test case individually within the `func_1` function. The logic involves checking the relative positions of Alice's and Bob's chips and determining the outcome based on the rules of movement and the parity of the difference in their x-coordinates.

Here are some key points about the logic:

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If Bob's chip is initially on or above Alice's chip (`x2 <= x1`), it immediately concludes in a draw because Alice cannot move downwards or diagonally downwards to reach Bob's position.
   - If the difference in x-coordinates between Bob and Alice (`x2 - x1`) is odd, it checks whether Alice can win by moving directly to Bob's column. If Alice can move directly to Bob's column, she wins. Otherwise, it proceeds to simulate further movements.
   - If the difference in x-coordinates is even, it checks whether Bob can win by moving directly to Alice's column. If Bob can move directly to Alice's column, he wins. Otherwise, it proceeds to simulate further movements.

2. **Simulated Movements**:
   - The code calculates how many moves Alice or Bob can make towards each other based on their current positions and the dimensions of the board.
   - It then checks if either player can force a win after these simulated movements by comparing distances and positions.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where players cannot make any more moves due to reaching the boundaries of the board.
   - It also considers scenarios where the players end up in a position where neither can force a win, resulting in a draw.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Parity**:
   - The code incorrectly assumes that if the difference in x-coordinates is odd, Alice can always win by moving directly to Bob's column. However, this is not necessarily true because Bob can still block Alice if he is positioned appropriately.
   - Similarly, the code incorrectly assumes that if the difference in x-coordinates is even, Bob can always win by moving directly to Alice's column.

2. **Incorrect Movement Simulations**:
   - The logic for simulating movements and determining the winner after these movements is flawed. The calculations for `a`, `b`, `t`, and `c` do not correctly reflect the actual movements and positions of the chips.
   - The conditions for determining a win or a draw after the simulated movements are overly simplistic and do not account for all possible scenarios.

3. **Inconsistent Output**:
   - The code outputs 'draw' in several cases where it should output 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on optimal play.
   - The code outputs 'Alice' or 'Bob' in cases where it should output 'draw'.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified in the logic and the incorrect handling of various scenarios, the provided program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
