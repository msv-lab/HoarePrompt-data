Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: This variable is set to `abs(y2 - y1)`, which means it holds the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
2. **`r`**: This is a list containing a single integer, which is the value of `t`.
3. **`n` and `m`**: These variables are not assigned any values in the given initial state.
4. **`y1`**: It remains unchanged from its post-initialization state.
5. **`x1`**: It is modified to `x1 + a`.
6. **`x2`**: It is modified to `x2 - a`.
7. **`a`**: Its value depends on the original relationship between `y1` and `y2`:
   - If `y1 >= y2`, then `a = y2 - 1`.
   - If `y1 < y2`, then `a = m - y2`.
8. **`b`**: This is an odd positive integer equal to `x2 - x1` before the modification.
9. **Conditions**: Either `x2 <= x1` or `x1 < 1` or `x2 > n` holds true.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is simply:
```python
print('draw')
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement directly outputs the string `'draw'`.
- None of the variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `y1`, `x1`, `x2`, `a`, `b`) are used in the print statement.
- Therefore, the output is solely dependent on the string provided in the print statement.

### Final Output:
Output: **draw**
