The code snippet provided multiplies the variable `temp` by 2. Based on the initial state, `temp` can be either 1, 2, or 4. After multiplying by 2, `temp` will be 2, 4, or 8 respectively.

Given the conditions:
- If `temp * 2` was less than `k`, `temp` could have been 1 or 2, making `temp` now 2 or 4.
- If `temp * 2` was not less than `k`, `temp` was 2, making `temp` now 4.

The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k`; `temp` is either 2, 4, or 8.**
