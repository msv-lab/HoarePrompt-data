The code snippet provided updates the values of `n` and `k` by mapping the first two elements of the list `l1` to integers. Given the initial state, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace, and `n` and `k` are initially defined based on the first two elements of `l1`.

After executing the code, `n` and `k` will be reassigned to the integer values of the first and second elements of `l1`, respectively. All other variables (`t`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `i`, `temp`) remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified later in the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing `n` elements where the first two elements are `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]` and the remaining `n - 2` elements are `0`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became not less than `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is still less than `k`.**
