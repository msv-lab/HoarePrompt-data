Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k` or not; `temp` is either `temp * 4` (if `temp * 2` was less than `k`) or `2` (if `temp * 2` was previously 1) if `temp * 2` is less than `k`. Otherwise, `temp` is either `temp * 2` (if `temp * 2` is less than `k`) or `1` (if `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`); we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

In simpler terms, the values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, `ans`, `i`, and `temp` remain unchanged from the initial state, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
