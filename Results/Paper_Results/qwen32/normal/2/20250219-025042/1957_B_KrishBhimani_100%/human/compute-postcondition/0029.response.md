To determine the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop operates and when it terminates. The loop doubles the value of `temp` until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`. At this point, the loop breaks.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `temp` starts at 1.
   - `i` starts at 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `temp * 2 < k`.
   - Each iteration doubles `temp` and increments `i` by 1.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop stops when `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.

Let's analyze the final state:
- After the loop terminates, `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is still less than `k`.
- `i` will be the number of times `temp` was doubled, which corresponds to the highest power of 2 less than `k`.

### Final Output State

- `t`: Remains unchanged (integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `l1`: Remains unchanged (list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace).
- `n`: Remains unchanged (integer value of the first element of `l1`).
- `k`: Remains unchanged (integer value of the second element of `l1`).
- `n` is not equal to 1: Remains unchanged.
- `arr`: Remains unchanged (empty list).
- `k0`: Remains unchanged (equal to `k`).
- `ans`: Remains unchanged (empty list).
- `i`: The number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became not less than `k`.
- `temp`: The largest power of 2 that is still less than `k`.

### Conclusion

The final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became not less than `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is still less than `k`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `temp` holds the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`, and `i` counts how many times `temp` was doubled to reach that value. All other variables remain unchanged.
