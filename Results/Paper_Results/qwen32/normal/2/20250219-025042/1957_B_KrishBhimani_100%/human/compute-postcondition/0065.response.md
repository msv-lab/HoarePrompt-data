Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable seems to represent the number of test cases but does not affect the current print statement directly.
   
2. **`l1`**: A list of substrings obtained from a new input line split by whitespace. This list contains at least two elements: `n` and `k`.

3. **`n`**: The integer value of the first element of the new `l1`. This represents the number of elements in the `ans` list.

4. **`k`**: The integer value of the second element of the new `l1`. This is used to calculate the values in the `ans` list.

5. **`arr`**: An empty list if `n` is not equal to 1. Not relevant for the current print statement.

6. **`k0`**: Equal to `k`. This variable is not used in the current print statement.

7. **`ans`**: A list of length `n` where:
   - The first element is \((1 << i) - 1\), which is \(2^i - 1\).
   - The second element is \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), which is \(k - (2^i - 1)\).
   - The remaining elements (if any) are zeros.
   
8. **`i`**: The number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`. This determines the value of the first element in `ans`.

9. **`temp`**: The largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

### Calculation of `ans`:

- **Determine `i` and `temp`**:
  - Start with `temp = 1` and `i = 0`.
  - Double `temp` and increment `i` until `temp * 2 >= k`.
  - The final `temp` will be \(2^i\).

- **Calculate the first two elements of `ans`**:
  - First element: \((1 << i) - 1 = 2^i - 1\).
  - Second element: \(k - (2^i - 1)\).

- **Remaining elements of `ans`**:
  - If `n > 2`, the remaining elements are zeros.

### Example Calculation:

Let's assume `n = 5` and `k = 10` for illustration:
- Determine `i` and `temp`:
  - Start with `temp = 1` and `i = 0`.
  - Double `temp` to 2, `i` becomes 1.
  - Double `temp` to 4, `i` becomes 2.
  - Double `temp` to 8, `i` becomes 3.
  - Stop because doubling `temp` to 16 would make it greater than or equal to 10.
  - So, `temp = 8` and `i = 3`.
  
- Calculate the first two elements of `ans`:
  - First element: \(2^3 - 1 = 7\).
  - Second element: \(10 - 7 = 3\).

- Remaining elements of `ans`:
  - Since `n = 5`, the remaining three elements are zeros.

Thus, `ans` would be `[7, 3, 0, 0, 0]`.

### General Description:

The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces. The first element is \(2^i - 1\), the second element is \(k - (2^i - 1)\), and the remaining elements (if any) are zeros, where `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`.

### Final Output:

Output: **2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1), 0, ..., 0 (where i is the number of times temp was doubled before temp * 2 became greater than or equal to k, and there are n-2 zeros if n > 2)**
