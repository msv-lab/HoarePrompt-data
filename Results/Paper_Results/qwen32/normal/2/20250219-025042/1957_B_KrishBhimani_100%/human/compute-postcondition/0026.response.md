Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained from the input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k` or not; `temp` is either 1, 2, or 4 depending on its previous value. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of the variables `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `i`, and `temp` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
