Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if `t` is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, and for each test case, `n` is between 1 and 200,000 inclusive, and `k` is between 1 and 1,000,000,000 inclusive, with the total sum of `n` across all test cases not exceeding 200,000, the function computes and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.**
