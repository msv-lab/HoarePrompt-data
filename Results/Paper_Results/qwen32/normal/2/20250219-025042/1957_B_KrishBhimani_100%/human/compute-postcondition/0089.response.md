In this case, the `while` loop is defined as `while True:`, which means it will always execute unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body (which is not shown here). Since the loop condition is always true, no adjustments to the program state are necessary to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k`; `temp` is either 1 or 4 if `temp * 2` is less than `k`, otherwise `temp` is 2.**
