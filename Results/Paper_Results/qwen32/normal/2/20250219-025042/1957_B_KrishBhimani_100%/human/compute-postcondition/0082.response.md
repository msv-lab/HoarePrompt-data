Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `temp` is 1; `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the only impact of the `break` statement is that the program exits the most internal loop or if statement.
