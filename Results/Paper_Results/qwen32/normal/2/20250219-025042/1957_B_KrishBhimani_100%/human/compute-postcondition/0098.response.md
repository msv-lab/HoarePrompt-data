To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables involved:

1. **t**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable does not affect the computation of `ans` directly, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.

2. **l1**: A list of substrings obtained from splitting a new input line by whitespace. This list contains at least two elements because `n` and `k` are derived from it.

3. **n**: The integer value of the first element of `l1`. This determines the length of the `ans` list.

4. **k**: The integer value of the second element of `l1`. This value is used to compute the elements of `ans`.

5. **arr**: An empty list if `n` is not equal to 1. Since the problem doesn't specify any operations on `arr` that would affect `ans`, we can ignore it for this specific print statement.

6. **k0**: Equal to `k`. This variable is not used further in the description, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.

7. **ans**: A list constructed as follows:
   - It starts with `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]`, where `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before the loop terminated.
   - `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
   - The list is then padded with `0`s to ensure its length is `n`.

8. **i**: The number of times `temp` was doubled before the loop terminated. This is essentially the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

9. **temp**: The largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

Let's walk through the construction of `ans`:

- First, find `temp`, the largest power of 2 less than `k`. This can be computed as `temp = 2^i` where `i` is the highest integer such that `2^i < k`.
- Compute `i` as the integer part of `log2(k)`.
- Calculate the first two elements of `ans`: `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]`.
- Append `0`s to `ans` until its length is `n`.

Given this understanding, let's formulate the output:

- The first element of `ans` is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is `2^i - 1`.
- The second element of `ans` is `k - (2^i - 1)`.
- The remaining elements of `ans` are `0`s, up to a total length of `n`.

Thus, the output will be a list starting with `2^i - 1` and `k - (2^i - 1)`, followed by `n - 2` zeros.

Output: **[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1), 0, ..., 0] (where i is the highest integer such that 2^i < k, and there are n - 2 zeros following the first two elements)**
