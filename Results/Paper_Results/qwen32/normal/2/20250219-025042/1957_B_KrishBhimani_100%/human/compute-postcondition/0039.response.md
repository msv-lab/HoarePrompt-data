The given code snippet only contains the line `arr = []`. This line reassigns `arr` to be an empty list. However, according to the initial state, `arr` is already described as an empty list if `n` is not equal to 1. Since the code does not change the values of any other variables and `arr` is already defined as an empty list under the given conditions, there is no actual change in the state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing `n` elements where the first two elements are `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]` and the remaining `n - 2` elements are `0`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became not less than `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is still less than `k`.**
