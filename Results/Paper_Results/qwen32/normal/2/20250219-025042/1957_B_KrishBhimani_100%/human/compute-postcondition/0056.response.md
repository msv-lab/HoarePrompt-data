In this case, the `while` loop is `while True:`, which means it will always execute as long as there's no explicit `break` statement inside the loop. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Here is the answer:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings obtained from the new input line split by whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; If `n` equals 1, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2` is less than `k` or not; `temp` is either `temp * 4` (if `temp * 2` was less than `k`) or `2` (if `temp * 2` was previously 1) if `temp * 2` is less than `k`. Otherwise, `temp` is either `temp * 2` (if `temp * 2` is less than `k`) or `1` (if `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
