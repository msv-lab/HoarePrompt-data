The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and for each test case, `x` and `n` are also integers within specified ranges. After executing the given code, the values of `x` and `n` will be updated to the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.**
