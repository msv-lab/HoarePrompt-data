The code updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, but since the increment operation is not part of the provided code snippet, we only consider the effect of `max(ans, i)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`.**
