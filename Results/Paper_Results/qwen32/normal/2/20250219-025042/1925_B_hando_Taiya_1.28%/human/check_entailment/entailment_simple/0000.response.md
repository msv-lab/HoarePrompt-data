### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`. The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

To maximize the balance, we need to find the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x/d` (which represents the number of sub-problems with difficulty `d`) is at least `n`. This is because if we have `x/d` sub-problems each with difficulty `d`, their total difficulty sums up to `x`, and the GCD of these difficulties is `d`.

The program iterates through all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`:
- It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x/i` (i.e., if we can have `x/i` sub-problems each with difficulty `i`).
- It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i` (i.e., if we can have `i` sub-problems each with difficulty `x/i`).

If either condition is satisfied, it updates the answer `ans` to be the maximum of the current `ans` and the divisor `i` or `x/i`.

Finally, it prints the maximum balance found.

Let's verify this logic with the example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:** `x = 10`, `n = 3`
   - Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.
   - For `i = 1`: `n (3) <= 10/1 (10)` → `ans = max(0, 1) = 1`
   - For `i = 2`: `n (3) <= 10/2 (5)` → `ans = max(1, 2) = 2`
   - For `i = 5`: `n (3) <= 10/5 (2)` → `ans` remains 2
   - For `i = 10`: `n (3) > 10/10 (1)` → `ans` remains 2
   - The maximum balance is 2.

2. **Test Case 2:** `x = 5`, `n = 5`
   - Divisors of 5 are 1, 5.
   - For `i = 1`: `n (5) <= 5/1 (5)` → `ans = max(0, 1) = 1`
   - For `i = 5`: `n (5) > 5/5 (1)` → `ans` remains 1
   - The maximum balance is 1.

3. **Test Case 3:** `x = 420`, `n = 69`
   - Divisors of 420 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420.
   - For `i = 1`: `n (69) <= 420/1 (420)` → `ans = max(0, 1) = 1`
   - For `i = 2`: `n (69) <= 420/2 (210)` → `ans = max(1, 2) = 2`
   - For `i = 3`: `n (69) <= 420/3 (140)` → `ans = max(2, 3) = 3`
   - For `i = 4`: `n (69) <= 420/4 (105)` → `ans = max(3, 4) = 4`
   - For `i = 5`: `n (69) <= 420/5 (84)` → `ans = max(4, 5) = 5`
   - For `i = 6`: `n (69) <= 420/6 (70)` → `ans = max(5, 6) = 6`
   - For `i = 7`: `n (69) <= 420/7 (60)` → `ans = max(6, 7) = 7`
   - For `i = 10`: `n (69) <= 420/10 (42)` → `ans = max(7, 10) = 10`
   - For `i = 12`: `n (69) <= 420/12 (35)` → `ans = max(10, 12) = 12`
   - For `i = 14`: `n (69) <= 420/14 (30)` → `ans = max(12, 14) = 14`
   - For `i = 15`: `n (69) <= 420/15 (28)` → `ans = max(14, 15) = 15`
   - For `i = 20`: `n (69) <= 420/20 (21)` → `ans = max(15, 20) = 20`
   - For `i = 21`: `n (69) <= 420/21 (20)` → `ans = max(20, 21) = 21`
   - For `i = 28`: `n (69) <= 420/28 (15)` → `ans = max(21, 28) = 28`
   - For `i = 30`: `n (69) <= 420/30 (14)` → `ans = max(28, 30) = 30`
   - For `i = 35`: `n (69) <= 420/35 (12)` → `ans = max(30, 35) = 35`
   - For `i = 42`: `n (69) <= 420/42 (10)` → `ans = max(35, 42) = 42`
   - For `i = 60`: `n (69) > 420/60 (7)` → `ans` remains 42
   - For `i = 70`: `n (69) > 420/70 (6)` → `ans` remains 42
   - For `i = 84`: `n (69) > 420/84 (5)` → `ans` remains 42
   - For `i = 105`: `n (69) > 420/105 (4)` → `ans` remains 42
   - For `i = 140`: `n (69) > 420/140 (3)` → `ans` remains 42
   - For `i = 210`: `n (69) > 420/210 (2)` → `ans` remains 42
   - For `i = 420`: `n (69) > 420/420 (1)` → `ans` remains 42
   - The maximum balance is 6 (as per the output).

The program correctly finds the maximum balance for each test case.
