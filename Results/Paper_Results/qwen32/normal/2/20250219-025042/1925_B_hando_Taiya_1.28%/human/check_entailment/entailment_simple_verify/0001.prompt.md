You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)

                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: the largest integer `i` or `x // i` that is a divisor of `x` and satisfies the given conditions for `n`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest integer i or x // i that is a divisor of x and satisfies the given conditions for n)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the maximum balance (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems under the given constraints.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems.
   - Each sub-problem must have a positive integer difficulty.
   - The sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems must be `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD of these difficulties.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The GCD of the difficulties will be maximized when the difficulties are multiples of some number `g`, and `g` is as large as possible.
   - This means `x` should be divisible by `g * n` or `g * m` where `m` is a factor of `n` and `g` is as large as possible.

3. **Approach:**
   - The program iterates through all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i` itself.
   - It keeps track of the maximum `i` that satisfies these conditions, which represents the largest possible GCD.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic of checking divisors up to the square root of `x` is efficient.
   - The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that the sum of `n` difficulties can be exactly `x` while maximizing the GCD.
   - The program correctly updates the answer with the maximum divisor found.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Test Case 1:** `x = 10`, `n = 3`
  - Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.
  - Checking `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`:
    - For `i = 1`: `n <= 10` (True), `ans = 1`.
    - For `i = 2`: `n <= 5` (True), `ans = 2`.
    - For `i = 5`: `n <= 2` (False).
    - For `i = 10`: `n <= 1` (False).
  - Maximum `ans` is 2, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 2:** `x = 5`, `n = 5`
  - Divisors of 5 are 1, 5.
  - Checking `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`:
    - For `i = 1`: `n <= 5` (True), `ans = 1`.
    - For `i = 5`: `n <= 1` (False).
  - Maximum `ans` is 1, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 3:** `x = 420`, `n = 69`
  - Divisors of 420 are many, but the largest `i` that satisfies the conditions is 6.
  - Maximum `ans` is 6, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems.
