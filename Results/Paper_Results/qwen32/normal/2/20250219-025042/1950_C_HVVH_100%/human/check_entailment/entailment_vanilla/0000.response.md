Let's go through the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `day` is initialized to `'AM'`. This is fine because we haven't read any input yet and we assume the default is AM.

2. **Reading Input**: The program reads an integer `n` which indicates the number of test cases. It then iterates over these `n` test cases.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads a string in the format `hh:mm` and splits it into two integers `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes).
   
4. **Conversion Logic**:
   - If `h` (hour) is `0`, it sets `h` to `12` and `day` to `'AM'`. This is correct because `00:00` in 24-hour format corresponds to `12:00 AM` in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is greater than `12`, it subtracts `12` from `h` and sets `day` to `'PM'`. This is correct because hours from `13` to `23` in 24-hour format correspond to `01` to `11` in the PM part of 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is between `1` and `12` (inclusive), it sets `day` to `'AM'`. However, there is a special case where `h` is `12`, which should be set to `'PM'`. The current logic correctly handles this case with the nested `if` statement.

5. **Output**: The program prints the converted time in the required format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM`.

The logic seems correct, but let's verify with some edge cases:

- `00:00` should output `12:00 AM`.
- `12:00` should output `12:00 PM`.
- `13:00` should output `01:00 PM`.
- `23:59` should output `11:59 PM`.

The program handles all these cases correctly based on the logic provided.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
