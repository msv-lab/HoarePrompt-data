The code snippet sets the variable `day` to the string `'AM'`. This change affects only the `day` variable, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 1, `h` is 12, `m` is the integer minute part of the new input time, `day` is 'AM'**.
