Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `day` is 'PM', `n` is greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time minus 12, `m` is the minute part of the input time, and `h` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that the variable `day` has been updated from `'AM'` to `'PM'`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
