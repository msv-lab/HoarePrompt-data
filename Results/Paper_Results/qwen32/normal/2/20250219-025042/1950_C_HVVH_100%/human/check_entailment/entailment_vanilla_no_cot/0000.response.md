Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it splits the input string into hours `h` and minutes `m`.
3. It handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format:
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, it sets `day` to 'AM'. However, there is an additional check to set `day` to 'PM' if `h` is 12, which is correct.

However, there is one issue in the logic of the program:
- When `h` is 12, it should be set to 12 and `day` should be 'PM', but the current code sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM' initially, and then changes `day` to 'PM' if `h` is 12. This part is logically correct, but the initial setting of `day` to 'AM' when `h` is 12 is unnecessary and can be simplified.

Despite this minor redundancy, the program correctly converts the times as required by the problem statement.

Thus, the program is correct.

Your response:
Correctness: **True**
