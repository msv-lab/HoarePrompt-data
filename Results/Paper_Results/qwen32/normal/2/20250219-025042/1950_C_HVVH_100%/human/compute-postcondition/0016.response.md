Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `n` is greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time, and `m` is the minute part of the input time. If `h` is greater than 12, `day` is 'PM' and `h` is reduced by 12. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM' and `h` is less than or equal to 12.**
