Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is the newly input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `arr` is the newly input string, `i` is 2. If `n` is even, `results` is `['no', 'yes', 'yes']` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`, or `['no', 'yes', 'no']` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is less than or equal to the count of 'D' in `arr`. If `n` is odd, `results` is `['yes', 'yes']` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`, or `['yes', 'no']` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is less than or equal to the count of 'D' in `arr`.**
