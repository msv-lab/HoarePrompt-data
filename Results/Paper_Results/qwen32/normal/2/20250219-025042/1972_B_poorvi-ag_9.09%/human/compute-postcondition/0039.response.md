Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only 'U' and 'D'. For each test case, it checks if the length of the string `n` is odd and if the count of 'U' in the string is greater than the count of 'D'. If both conditions are met, it outputs 'yes'; otherwise, it outputs 'no'.**
