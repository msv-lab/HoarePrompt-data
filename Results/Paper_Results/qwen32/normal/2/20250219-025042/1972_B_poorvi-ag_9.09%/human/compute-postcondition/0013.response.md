Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `arr` is the input string. If `n` is even, `results` is a list containing the string 'no'. If `n` is odd, `results` is a list containing the single element `'yes'` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`, or the single element `'no'` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is less than or equal to the count of 'D' in `arr`.**
