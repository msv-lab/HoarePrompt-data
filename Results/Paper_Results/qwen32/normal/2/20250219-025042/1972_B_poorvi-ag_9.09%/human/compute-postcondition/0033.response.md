In this case, the loop iterates over the elements of the `results` list. The loop variable `i` takes on the value of each element in the list one by one.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value of the last element processed from the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the `results` list for `i` to take on.

Let's break it down:

- The `results` list is of length `t` where `t` is at least 1.
- Each element in `results` is either `'yes'` or `'no'`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` held the value of the last element in the `results` list processed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have more than one element (since the previous iteration already processed one element). Therefore, `t` must be at least 2, and `i` should now hold the value of the next element in the list.

Since the loop variable `i` is reassigned with each iteration to the next element in the list, we don't need to specify its value explicitly beyond knowing that it will take the value of the next element in the list.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`results` is a list of length `t` where `t` is at least 2, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`**
