Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, `n` is the newly input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `arr` is the newly input string, `i` is 2. If `n` is even, `results` is a list containing the strings 'no', 'yes', and 'no'. If `n` is odd, `results` is a list containing the elements `'no'` and `'yes'` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is less than or equal to the count of 'D' in `arr`, or the elements `'yes'` and `'no'` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`.**

Explanation: The `results` list has been updated to include an additional 'no' at the end. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged. If `n` was even, `results` originally contained 'no' and 'yes', and now contains 'no', 'yes', and 'no'. If `n` was odd, `results` originally contained either 'yes' or 'no' and 'yes', and now contains 'no' followed by those original elements.
