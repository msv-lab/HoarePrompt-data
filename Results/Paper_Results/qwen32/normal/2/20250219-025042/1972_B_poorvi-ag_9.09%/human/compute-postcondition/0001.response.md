The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified, and the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D"; `results` is an empty list.**
