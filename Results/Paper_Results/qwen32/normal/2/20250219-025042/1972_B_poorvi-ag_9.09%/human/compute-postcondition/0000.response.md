The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means that the value of `t` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the input, while the conditions on `t` (that it is between 1 and 100 inclusive) remain valid. The variables `n` and `s` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D".**
