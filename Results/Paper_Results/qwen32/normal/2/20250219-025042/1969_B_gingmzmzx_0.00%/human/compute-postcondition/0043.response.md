The given code snippet increments the count of the current element `c` in the list `s` within the list `cnt`. Since `c` is either 0 or 1, this operation will increase either the first or the second element of `cnt` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (unchanged)
- `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least one element (unchanged)
- `n` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1 (unchanged)
- `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s` (unchanged unless `c` is 0)
- `cnt` is either `[1, 1]`, `[2, 0]`, or `[0, 2]` (will change based on the value of `c`)
- `c` is the next element in the list `s` following the previously processed element (unchanged)

After executing `cnt[c] += 1`, the value of `cnt` will change depending on whether `c` is 0 or 1:
- If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` will be incremented by 1.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` will be incremented by 1.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is updated to `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]` if `c` is 0 or `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s` following the previously processed element.**
