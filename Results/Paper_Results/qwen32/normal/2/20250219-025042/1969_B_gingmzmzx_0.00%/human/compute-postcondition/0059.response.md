The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`. Given that `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s` and `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, the new value of `ans` will be `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and must have at least one element, `n` is `n + 1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`, and `c` is not equal to 0.**
