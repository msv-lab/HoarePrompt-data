The code snippet resets the `cnt` list to `[0, 0]`. This means the counts of 0s and 1s in the list `s` are reset to zero. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is the computed value based on the given logic.**
