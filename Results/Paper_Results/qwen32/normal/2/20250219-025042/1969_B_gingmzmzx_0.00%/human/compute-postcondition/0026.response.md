The code snippet provided reassigns the list `s` with new values from the input. This means the original list `s` is replaced with a new list of integers (either 0 or 1) obtained from the user input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by this line of code.

Given this, the Output State would be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 obtained from the input, `n` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [count of 0s in `s`, count of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the computed value based on the given logic.**
