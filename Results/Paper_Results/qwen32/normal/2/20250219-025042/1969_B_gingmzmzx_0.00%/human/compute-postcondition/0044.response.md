The code snippet increments `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` (the count of 1s in the list `s`) is greater than 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least one element.
- `n` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1.
- `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`.
- `cnt` is updated to `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]` if `c` is 0 or `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]` if `c` is 1.
- `c` is the next element in the list `s` following the previously processed element.

After executing the code snippet `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0`, the value of `ans` will increase by 1 if there is at least one 1 in the list `s` up to the current point. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is updated to `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]` if `c` is 0 or `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s` following the previously processed element, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1] > 0`.**
