Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `s` is a binary string of length between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer input, while the conditions and properties of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
