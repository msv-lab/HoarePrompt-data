You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if we can select exactly `k/2` elements from array `a` and `k/2` elements from array `b` such that all integers from `1` to `k` are included in the selected elements.
- The program should output "YES" if it's possible and "NO" otherwise.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the lengths of arrays `a` and `b`, and the value of `k`.
3. It reads the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.
4. It creates sets of unique elements from `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
5. It calculates the elements that are unique to `a` (`only_a`), unique to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).
6. It checks if the number of unique elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds `k/2`. If so, it outputs "NO".
7. It checks if the total number of distinct elements (from `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is less than `k`. If so, it outputs "NO".
8. If neither of the above conditions is met, it outputs "YES".

### Potential Issues:
Let's consider if there are any edge cases or scenarios that the program might miss.

#### Edge Case 1:
- Suppose `a` and `b` contain all elements from `1` to `k` but in such a way that the unique elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceed `k/2`.
- For example, if `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `k = 6`, the program should output "YES" because we can pick `[1, 2, 3]` from `a` and `[4, 5, 6]` from `b` (or vice versa).

#### Edge Case 2:
- Suppose `a` and `b` together do not contain all elements from `1` to `k`.
- For example, if `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = [4, 5, 6]` and `k = 6`, the program should output "NO" because we cannot pick `k/2` elements from each array that cover all numbers from `1` to `6`.

#### Edge Case 3:
- Suppose `a` and `b` have some overlap but not enough to cover all elements from `1` to `k`.
- For example, if `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `b = [3, 4, 5, 6]` and `k = 6`, the program should output "YES" because we can pick `[1, 2]` from `a` and `[3, 4, 5, 6]` from `b` (or vice versa).

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Test Case 1:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 5 6
  2 3 8 5 6 5
  1 3 4 10 5

- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 5 6
  2 3 4 5 6 5
  1 3 8 10 3
  ```
- Expected Output: `NO`
- Program Output: `NO` (Correct)

#### Test Case 3:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 3 4
  1 3 5
  2 4 6
  ```
- Expected Output: `YES`
- Program Output: `YES` (Correct)

#### Test Case 4:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  2 5 4
  1 4
  7 3 4 4 2
  ```
- Expected Output: `NO`
- Program Output: `NO` (Correct)

#### Test Case 5:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  2 5 4
  1 4
  2 4 2
  ```
- Expected Output: `YES`
- Program Output: `YES` (Correct)

#### Test Case 6:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 3 4
  2 2 1
  4 2 5
  ```
- Expected Output: `NO`
- Program Output: `NO` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the provided program and testing it with various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from each array such that all integers from `1` to `k` are included. It handles cases where the unique elements in either array exceed `k/2`, and it correctly checks if the total number of distinct elements is sufficient to cover all numbers from `1` to `k`.
