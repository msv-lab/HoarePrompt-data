The code snippet reassigns the variable `unique_b` to be a set containing unique elements from the list `b`. This means that any duplicate elements in `b` are removed in `unique_b`.

Given the initial state, `unique_b` was already defined as a set containing unique elements from the list `b`. Reassigning `unique_b` does not change its content since it is already a set of unique elements from `b`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the variables mentioned.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next); `a` is a list of n_next integers where 1 <= a_next_i <= 10^6 for each i; `b` is a list of m_next integers where 1 <= b_next_j <= 10^6 for each j; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k_next`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k_next`; `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`; `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `total_distinct` is `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`; `results` contains `'YES'` appended to its previous contents.**
