To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how the loop processes each test case and appends either 'YES' or 'NO' to the `results` list based on the conditions specified.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initialization:** The `results` list starts as an empty list.
- **Loop Iteration:** For each test case `(n, m, k, a, b)` in `cases`:
  - `unique_a` and `unique_b` are sets of unique elements from `a` and `b`, respectively.
  - `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` filter these sets to include only elements ≤ `k`.
  - `only_a` and `only_b` identify elements unique to `a` and `b` within the range ≤ `k`.
  - `both` identifies elements common to both `a` and `b` within the range ≤ `k`.
  - The code then checks:
    - If `len(only_a) > k // 2`, it appends 'NO'.
    - If `len(only_b) > k // 2`, it appends 'NO'.
    - If `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both) < k`, it appends 'NO'.
    - Otherwise, it appends 'YES'.

### Final Output State:
After processing all test cases, the `results` list will contain a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the above conditions for each test case.

### Description in Natural Language:
The final output state is a list named `results` that contains a series of 'YES' and 'NO' strings. Each string corresponds to whether the respective test case satisfied the conditions to form a valid selection of elements from the lists `a` and `b` under the constraints defined by `k`.

**Output State:** **`results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `cases` based on the specified conditions.**

This means that after all iterations, `results` will have processed all test cases and will reflect the outcome ('YES' or 'NO') for each one.
