t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k where 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2 * min(n, m), and k is even. Additionally, each test case includes two lists: a list a of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for each i, and a list b of m integers where 1 <= b_j <= 10^6 for each j. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4 * 10^5.
