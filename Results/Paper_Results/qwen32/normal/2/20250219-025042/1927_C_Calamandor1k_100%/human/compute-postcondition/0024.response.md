The code snippet `unique_a = set(a)` updates the `unique_a` variable to be a set containing unique elements from the list `a`. This means that any duplicate elements in `a` are removed in `unique_a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n', m', k', a', b') where 1 <= n', m' <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k' <= 2 * min(n', m'), and k' is even; `a` is a list of n' integers where 1 <= a'_i <= 10^6 for each i, `b` is a list of m' integers where 1 <= b'_j <= 10^6 for each j; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`; `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `total_distinct` is `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`; `results` contains 'YES' appended to its previous contents.**
