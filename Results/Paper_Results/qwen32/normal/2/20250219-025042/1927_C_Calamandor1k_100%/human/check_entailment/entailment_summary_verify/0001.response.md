Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summary to ensure it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if it's possible to select exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from each of two arrays \(a\) and \(b\) such that the selected elements together cover all integers from 1 to \(k\).

### Key Points:
1. **Unique Elements**: Consider only unique elements from each array that are ≤ \(k\).
2. **Partitioning**:
   - `only_a`: Elements present only in \(a\).
   - `only_b`: Elements present only in \(b\).
   - `both`: Elements present in both \(a\) and \(b\).
3. **Constraints**:
   - The number of elements in `only_a` should not exceed \(\frac{k}{2}\).
   - The number of elements in `only_b` should not exceed \(\frac{k}{2}\).
   - The total number of distinct elements (`len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`) should be at least \(k\).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one as follows:
1. **Unique Elements Filtering**:
   - It creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` from the lists \(a\) and \(b\), respectively.
   - It filters out elements greater than \(k\) to get `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
2. **Set Operations**:
   - It calculates `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` using set operations.
3. **Validation Checks**:
   - It checks if the sizes of `only_a` and `only_b` are within the limit \(\frac{k}{2}\).
   - It checks if the total number of distinct elements is at least \(k\).
4. **Output**:
   - It appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list based on the above checks.

### Verification:
Let's verify the logic step-by-step:

1. **Unique Elements Filtering**:
   - Correctly filters elements ≤ \(k\) from both arrays.
   
2. **Set Operations**:
   - `only_a` and `only_b` correctly represent elements unique to each array.
   - `both` correctly represents elements common to both arrays.
   
3. **Validation Checks**:
   - Ensures that the number of unique elements in `only_a` and `only_b` does not exceed \(\frac{k}{2}\).
   - Ensures that the total number of distinct elements (from `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is at least \(k\).

### Edge Cases:
- **No Common Elements**: If there are no common elements, the program checks if the sum of unique elements from both arrays is at least \(k\).
- **All Elements Common**: If all elements are common, the program checks if the number of common elements is at least \(k\).
- **Some Elements Only in One Array**: The program ensures that the number of unique elements in `only_a` and `only_b` does not exceed \(\frac{k}{2}\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem. It ensures that the constraints are met and handles various edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the analysis and verification.
