The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers and some constraints. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to select `k` distinct integers such that at most half of them come from each list. It returns a list of results ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether the condition is met for each test case.
