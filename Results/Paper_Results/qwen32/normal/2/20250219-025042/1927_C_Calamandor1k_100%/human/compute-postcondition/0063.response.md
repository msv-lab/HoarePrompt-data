Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cases` containing `t` test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. The function processes these inputs and returns a variable `results` which contains the output for each test case.**
