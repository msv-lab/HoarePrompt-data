The value of `pk` is calculated as `n // 2`. Since `n` is given to be an even integer, `pk` will be an integer representing half the length of `n`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is the input integer and `n` is even, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n // 2`.**
