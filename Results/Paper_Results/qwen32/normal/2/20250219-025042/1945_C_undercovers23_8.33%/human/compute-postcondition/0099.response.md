To determine the new state after executing the given code, let's analyze the variables and their current values:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4 (unchanged)
- `n` is 7 (unchanged)
- `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1' (unchanged)
- `s` is the input string "010101" (unchanged)
- `pk` is 3 (unchanged)
- `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'] (unchanged)
- `o` is 3 (unchanged)
- `z` is 3 (unchanged)
- `mini` is 100000000 (unchanged)
- `zero_perc` is 50 (will be updated)
- `one_perc` is 50 (unchanged)
- `lst` is [i + 1] if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` is [] (unchanged)
- `i` is 4 (unchanged)

The code snippet is:
```python
zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
```

Given that `i` is 4, the denominator `(i + 1)` is 5. To find the new value of `zero_perc`, we need to know the value of `zero`. According to the problem description, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0'. Since `s[4]` is '0', `zero` has been incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `zero` is not specified, so we assume it was 0 before this increment, making `zero` equal to 1.

Now, we can calculate `zero_perc`:
```python
zero_perc = math.ceil(1 * 100 / 5) = math.ceil(20) = 20
```

Therefore, the updated value of `zero_perc` is 20. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 3, `z` is 3, `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is 20, `one_perc` is 50, `lst` is [i + 1] if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` is [], `i` is 4.**
