The given Python code snippet is:

```python
final = []
```

This line of code reassigns the variable `final` to an empty list `[]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the user input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in `s`, `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`, `zero` is the count of '0's in `s`, `one` is the count of '1's in `s`, `lst` is a list containing at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, `final` is `[]`.**
