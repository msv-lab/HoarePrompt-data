To determine the new value of `one_perc`, we need to evaluate the expression `(o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)` and then apply the `math.ceil` function to it.

Given:
- `o` is 3
- `one` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but since `s` is "010101" and `o` counts the number of '1's, `one` is 3.
- `n` is 7
- `i` is 4

Let's substitute these values into the formula:

\[
\text{one\_perc} = \text{math.ceil}\left(\frac{(3 - 3) \times 100}{(7 - 4 - 1)}\right)
\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses:

\[
\text{one\_perc} = \text{math.ceil}\left(\frac{0 \times 100}{2}\right) = \text{math.ceil}(0) = 0
\]

Thus, `one_perc` is updated to 0.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 3, `z` is 3, `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is 20, `one_perc` is 0, `lst` is [i + 1] if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `lst` is [], `i` is 4.**
