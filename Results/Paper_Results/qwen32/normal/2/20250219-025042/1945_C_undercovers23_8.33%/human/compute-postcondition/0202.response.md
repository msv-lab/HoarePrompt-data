The code snippet calculates the value of `c1` using the formula `o * 100 // n`. This operation does not affect the variable `final`, which remains an empty list as per the initial state.

Given that `c1` is newly introduced and its value depends on the values of `o` and `n`, the output state includes the new variable `c1` with its calculated value.

Output State: **`final` is an empty list; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.**
