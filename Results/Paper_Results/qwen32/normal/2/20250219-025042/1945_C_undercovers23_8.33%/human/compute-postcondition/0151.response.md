The given Python code snippet sets `lst` to an empty list. This means the previous contents of `lst`, which were `[1, 3, 5]`, are replaced with an empty list.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4 (after being decremented by 1 from the previous state).
- `n` is still an input integer.
- `a` is still a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1'.
- `s` is still the user input string.
- `pk` is still `n // 2`.
- `sl` is still a list of characters from the string `s`.
- `o` is still the count of '1's in `s`.
- `z` is still the count of '0's in `s`.
- `mini` is still 0.
- `zero` is still 0.
- `one` is still 0.
- `final` is still `[7]` if `c1` is less than 50, or `[0]` if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4 (after being decremented by 1 from the previous state); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the user input string; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in `s`; `mini` is 0; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0; `lst` is []; `final` is [7] if `c1` is less than 50, or [0] if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**
