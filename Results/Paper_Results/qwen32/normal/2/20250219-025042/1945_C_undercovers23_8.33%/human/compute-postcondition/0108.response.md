To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

- Initial State: 
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4
  - `n` is 7
  - `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1'
  - `s` is the input string "010101"
  - `pk` is 3
  - `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1']
  - `o` is 4 if `s[i]` is '1', otherwise `o` remains 3
  - `z` is 3
  - `mini` is 100000000
  - `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 6)`
  - `one_perc` is 0
  - `lst` is []
  - `i` is 5
  - `zero` is `previous_value_of_zero` + 1 if `s[i]` is '0'

Given `i` is 5 and `s[i]` is '1', `o` is set to 4.

The code snippet modifies `one_perc`:
```python
one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
```

Substituting the known values:
- `o` is 4
- `one` is 0 (as per the initial state)
- `n` is 7
- `i` is 5

So, the expression becomes:
```python
one_perc = math.ceil((4 - 0) * 100 / (7 - 5 - 1)) = math.ceil(4 * 100 / 1) = math.ceil(400) = 400
```

Thus, `one_perc` is updated to 400.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is 7, `a` is a string of length 6 consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string "010101", `pk` is 3, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s` ['0', '1', '0', '1', '0', '1'], `o` is 4, `z` is 3, `mini` is 100000000, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 6)`, `one_perc` is 400, `lst` is [], `i` is 5, and `zero` is `previous_value_of_zero` + 1 if `s[i]` is '0'.**
