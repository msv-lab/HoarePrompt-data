The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2·10^4, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is a list containing the elements it previously had plus `i + 1` if `zero_perc` ≥ 50 and `one_perc` ≥ 50, `mini` is 100000000, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', `one` is set to 0 if `s[i]` is '0' and 1 if `s[i]` is '1', `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
