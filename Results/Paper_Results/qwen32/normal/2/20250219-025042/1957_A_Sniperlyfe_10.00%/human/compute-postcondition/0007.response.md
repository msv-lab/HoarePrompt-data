To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the behavior of the loop.

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases.
- Following `t`, there are pairs of integers `(n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` for each test case.
- `freq` is an initially empty dictionary.

### Loop Code:
```python
for n in arr:
    freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
```

### Observations from Given Outputs:
1. **After 1 iteration**:
   - `arr` was `[1, 1, 5]`.
   - `freq` became `{1: 1}`.
   
2. **After 2 iterations**:
   - `arr` was still `[1, 1, 5]`.
   - `freq` became `{1: 1, 5: 1}`.
   
3. **After 3 iterations**:
   - `arr` was still `[1, 1, 5]`.
   - `freq` became `{1: 1, 5: 2}`.
   
From these observations, it seems that the loop is not correctly iterating over the intended structure of `arr`. The loop is treating each element of `arr` as `n` sequentially, which is incorrect based on the problem description. Instead, it should process each test case properly.

### Correct Interpretation:
For each test case, we need to:
1. Read `n` (number of sticks).
2. Read the next `n` integers (stick lengths).
3. Count the frequency of each stick length in `freq`.

However, based on the provided outputs, it seems like the loop is only iterating over the elements of `arr` without considering the structure of test cases properly. Given the outputs, we can infer that the loop is simply counting the occurrences of each element in `arr` after the first element `t`.

### Final Output State:
Given the provided outputs, the loop will continue to count the occurrences of each element in `arr` until it has processed all elements.

If we assume `arr` remains `[1, 1, 5]` for simplicity (as per the given outputs), the final state would be:
- `freq` will have counted all elements in `arr` after the first element `t`.

Thus, the final `freq` dictionary will be:
- `{1: 2, 5: 1}` because `1` appears twice (once as `t` and once as a stick length) and `5` appears once.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **freq = {1: 2, 5: 1}**.

This means that the number `1` appears twice in `arr` (considering `t` as part of the sequence), and the number `5` appears once.
