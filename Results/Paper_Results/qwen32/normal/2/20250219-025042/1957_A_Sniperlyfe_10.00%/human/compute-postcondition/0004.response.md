The code snippet updates the dictionary `freq` by incrementing the count of the key `n`. Initially, `freq` only contains the key `1` with a value of `1`. Since `n` is `5`, the code checks if `5` is a key in `freq`. It is not, so it defaults to `0` and adds `1` to it, resulting in `freq[5]` being set to `1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` is 1, the second element `n` is 1, and the third element is an integer representing the length of one stick (e.g., `arr = [1, 1, 5]`); `freq` is a dictionary with the keys `1` mapped to the value `1` and `5` mapped to the value `1`; `n` is 5**.
