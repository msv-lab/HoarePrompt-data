You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers where the first element indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer followed by that many integers representing stick lengths. Despite the input, the function always returns 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks. The key points are:
- Each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick.
- No stick can be used in more than one polygon.
- Regular polygons require all sides to be of equal length.
- We need to maximize the number of such polygons.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of sticks `n`.
2. Reads the lengths of the sticks into a list `arr`.
3. Calls the function `func_1` with the list of stick lengths.
4. Prints the result returned by `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1`
The function `func_1` does the following:
1. Initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to count the frequency of each stick length.
2. Iterates through the list of stick lengths, updating the frequency count for each length.
3. Calculates the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4 (`v // 4`), which represents the number of squares (the smallest regular polygon) that can be formed with sticks of the same length.
4. Returns this sum as the result.

### Issues in the Program
The primary issue with the program is that it assumes that the only regular polygon that can be formed is a square (4-sided polygon). However, the problem statement allows for regular polygons with any number of sides greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, the program does not account for the possibility of forming triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc., which could potentially allow for more polygons to be formed.

### Correctness
Given the above analysis, the program is not correct because it only considers the formation of squares and ignores other possible regular polygons. Therefore, it may not always produce the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
