`t` is initially `True`, which is equivalent to `1` in a numerical context. The operation `t -= 1` means `t = t - 1`. Since `t` is `1`, after subtracting `1`, `t` becomes `0`.

The list and `u` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation.

Output State: **[0, 0, d_1, d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2, ..., sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}), sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}) + d_{n-1}], u is 0, t is 0**.
