You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Program:
def func():
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        r()
        a = (-1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0)
        b = [0, 0]
        for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += (b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y))
        print(b, 'B')
        (u,) = r()
        while u:
            u -= 1
            (c, d) = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of city positions and a series of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the cumulative distance to the closest city from the midpoint between two specified cities.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are some issues identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The program does not explicitly calculate the closest cities for each city. Instead, it seems to be attempting to calculate some cumulative distances, but this is not aligned with the problem's requirement to find the closest city and use it to minimize the cost of traveling between cities.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate costs using a formula involving powers and differences, but this does not align with the problem's requirement to either move to the closest city for 1 coin or directly move to another city for the distance cost.

3. **Handling Queries**: The program does not correctly handle the queries. It seems to be trying to precompute something based on the cities' positions, but this precomputed value is not used correctly to answer the queries about the minimum cost to travel between two cities.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if the cities are very close together or very far apart, the program might not compute the correct minimum cost.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program will not produce the expected output because it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost based on the rules provided.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Determine the closest city for each city.
- Use a dynamic programming approach or similar method to precompute the minimum cost to travel between any two cities, considering the option to move to the closest city for 1 coin.
- Handle each query efficiently using the precomputed data.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
