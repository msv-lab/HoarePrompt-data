Postcondition: **The list remains [0, 0, d_1, d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2, ..., sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}), sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}) + d_{n-1}]. `u` is now `u - 1`. `c` is the first value returned by `r()`, and `d` is the second value returned by `r()`. Regardless of whether `c < d` or not, the state of the list, `u`, `c`, and `d` remains unchanged from their initial states as described in the precondition.**
