The given code snippet defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This lambda function does not directly modify any existing variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, `y_i`) but provides a way to read and process input data.

Since no actual input is provided or processed in the given code snippet, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, and `y_i` remain unchanged. The only new entity introduced is the lambda function `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `r` is a lambda function that maps input to integers.**
