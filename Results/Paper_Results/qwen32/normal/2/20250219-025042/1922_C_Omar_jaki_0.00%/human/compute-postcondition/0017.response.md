To determine what will be printed by the `print(b, 'B')` statement, we need to analyze the initial state provided and identify the value of `b`.

### Initial State Analysis:
The initial state describes a list with a specific pattern:
\[ [0, 0, d_1, d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2, \ldots, \text{sum}(d_1, \ldots, d_{n-2}), \text{sum}(d_1, \ldots, d_{n-2}) + d_{n-1}] \]

This list appears to be structured such that:
- The first two elements are both 0.
- Starting from the third element, each pair of elements follows a cumulative sum pattern based on the sequence \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_{n-1}\).

However, the variable `b` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state description. Therefore, we cannot directly determine the value of `b` from the given information.

### Conclusion:
Given that `b` is not defined in the initial state, it is impossible to determine its value based solely on the provided information. If `b` were defined elsewhere in the code or if there was additional context, we could proceed further. As it stands, we do not have enough information to determine what `b` represents or its value.

Since the task requires us to provide the most precise description possible, we must acknowledge the lack of information about `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **b B (where b is an undefined variable)**
