Let's analyze the given for loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that in each iteration, `w` takes the value from `a`, `x` from `a[1:]`, `y` from `a[2:]`, and `z` from `a[3:]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
- `u` is `0`
- `t` is `0`
- `b` is `[0, 0, y - x, v]`

In the first iteration, the values would be:
- `w` is `0` (from `a`)
- `x` is `1` (from `a[1:]`)
- `y` is `2` (from `a[2:]`)
- `z` is `3` (from `a[3:]`)

Since the array `a` has only 4 elements, the loop will run only once because in the next iteration, `a[4:]` would be empty, causing `zip` to stop.

Therefore, there is no next iteration possible given the current state of `a`. The loop has already completed its execution.

However, if we were to consider what the state would look like if there were another iteration (hypothetically), we would need to adjust the indices accordingly. But since `a` only has 4 elements, this hypothetical scenario does not apply here.

So, the final state remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, with the understanding that the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`a` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, `u` is `0`, `t` is `0`, `b` is `[0, 0, y - x, v]`**
