To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

The code snippet modifies the list `b` by appending two new elements to it. These elements are calculated based on the current values in `b` and some conditions involving the variables `v`, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Given:
- `b` is initially `[0, 0, y - x, y - x]`.
- `w = a[i+1]`
- `x = a[i+2]`
- `y = a[i+3]`
- `z = a[i+4]`

The new elements being appended to `b` are:
1. `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`
2. `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`

Let's denote the initial values of `b[-2]` and `b[-1]` as `y - x` since they are both the same initially.

Thus, the new elements become:
1. `(y - x) + v ** (v > x - w)`
2. `(y - x) + v ** (v > z - y)`

So, the updated `b` will be:
`[0, 0, y - x, y - x, (y - x) + v ** (v > x - w), (y - x) + v ** (v > z - y)]`

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `r`, `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value returned by `r()` minus 1, which satisfies \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4-1\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of `n+2` integers where the first element is `-1000000000.0`, the last element is `2000000000.0`, and the middle `n` elements are the original integers in increasing order; `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq n+2\) and \(x_i \neq y_i\); `r` is a lambda function that maps input to integers; `b` is `[0, 0, y - x, y - x, (y - x) + v ** (v > x - w), (y - x) + v ** (v > z - y)]`; `w = a[i+1]`; `x = a[i+2]`; `y = a[i+3]`; `z = a[i+4]`.**
