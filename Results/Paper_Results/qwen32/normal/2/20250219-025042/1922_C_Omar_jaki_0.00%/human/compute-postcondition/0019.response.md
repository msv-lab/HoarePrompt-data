To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head. The loop is defined as:

```python
while u:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the condition `u` evaluates to `True`. In Python, any non-zero integer, non-empty string, non-empty list, etc., is considered `True`. Conversely, `0`, `None`, empty strings, empty lists, etc., are considered `False`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- The list `[0, 0, d_1, d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2, ..., sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}), sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}) + d_{n-1}]` is present.
- `u` is the value returned by `r()`.

Since the loop condition is `while u`, we need to ensure that `u` is a truthy value (i.e., not `0`, `None`, an empty list, etc.). The only variable we can adjust is `u` because it is the only variable mentioned in the loop head.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to set `u` to a truthy value. A simple choice would be to set `u` to `1` (or any other non-zero integer).

State: **[0, 0, d_1, d_1, d_1 + d_2, d_1 + d_2, ..., sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}), sum(d_1, ..., d_{n-2}) + d_{n-1}]; `u` is 1**
