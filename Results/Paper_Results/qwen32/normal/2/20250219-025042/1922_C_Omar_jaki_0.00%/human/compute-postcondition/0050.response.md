To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

Initial State: `a` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, `u` is `0`, `t` is `0`, `b` is `[0, 0, y - x]`

The code snippet is:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

Let's break down the changes to `b`:
- `b[-2]` refers to the second-to-last element of `b`, which is `0`.
- `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is `y - x`.

The expression `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to:
- `v > x - w` is a boolean expression that will be `True` or `False`. In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`.
- Depending on whether `v > x - w` is `True` or `False`, `v ** (v > x - w)` will be `v ** 1` (which is `v`) or `v ** 0` (which is `1`).

Similarly, the expression `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to:
- `v > z - y` is a boolean expression that will be `True` or `False`.
- Depending on whether `v > z - y` is `True` or `False`, `v ** (v > z - y)` will be `v ** 1` (which is `v`) or `v ** 0` (which is `1`).

Thus, the new elements added to `b` are:
- `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`, which is `0 + v ** (v > x - w)`, simplifying to `v ** (v > x - w)`
- `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`, which is `(y - x) + v ** (v > z - y)`

So, the new `b` will be `[0, 0, y - x, v ** (v > x - w), (y - x) + v ** (v > z - y)]`.

The other variables `a`, `u`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, `u` is `0`, `t` is `0`, `b` is `[0, 0, y - x, v ** (v > x - w), (y - x) + v ** (v > z - y)]`**.
