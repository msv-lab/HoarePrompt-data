To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to break down the calculations involved in determining the value of `ans`.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Inputs and Initializations:**
   - `T` is given to be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `n` is the number of integers in the list `a` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
   - `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
   - `MOD` is a constant set to 1000000007.
   
2. **Calculations:**
   - `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
   - `t` is calculated as `(maximum subarray sum of `a` * 2^(k-1)) % 1000000007`.
     - The maximum subarray sum can be found using Kadane's algorithm.
   - `t_initial` is the initial value of `t` before any further calculations.
   - `ans` is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     ans = (((s + t\_initial) \% MOD + MOD) \% MOD + t\_initial \times (2^{(k-1)} - 1)) \% MOD
     \]

### Explanation of `ans` Calculation:
- **Step 1:** Calculate the sum of all elements in `a` and store it in `s`.
- **Step 2:** Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum of `a`.
- **Step 3:** Compute `t_initial` as `(maximum subarray sum * 2^(k-1)) % 1000000007`.
- **Step 4:** Compute `ans` using the provided formula, ensuring all operations respect the modulo `MOD`.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity of the calculations and the dependencies on the input values, the exact numerical value of `ans` cannot be determined without specific values for `n`, `k`, and the list `a`. However, we can describe the final output precisely based on the formula and the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as (((s + t_initial) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t_initial * (2^(k-1) - 1)) % MOD, with s being the sum of all elements in the list `a`, t_initial being (maximum subarray sum of `a` * 2^(k-1)) % 1000000007, and MOD being 1000000007)**
