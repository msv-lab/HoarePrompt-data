The code snippet updates the value of `t` to be the maximum of its current value and `tmp`. Since the initial state specifies that `tmp` is 0 if it was initially less than 0, otherwise `tmp` remains `tmp + x`, and `t` is initially 0, the updated value of `t` will be `max(0, tmp)`.

If `tmp` was initially less than 0, it is set to 0, so `t` remains 0. If `tmp` was initially non-negative, `t` becomes `tmp`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is `max(0, tmp)`, `tmp` is 0 if it was initially less than 0, otherwise `tmp + x`, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(((s + t_initial) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t_initial * (2^(k-1) - 1)) % MOD`.**
