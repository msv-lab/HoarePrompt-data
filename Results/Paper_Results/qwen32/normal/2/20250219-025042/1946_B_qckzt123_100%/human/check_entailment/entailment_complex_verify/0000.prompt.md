You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that it adheres to the problem description for all potential cases. Let's analyze the code step-by-step:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an array `a` of `n` integers.
- Perform exactly `k` operations where in each operation, we select any contiguous subarray of `a` (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array.
- Goal: Find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - It calculates the sum of the array `s`.

3. **Finding Maximum Positive Subarray Sum (`t`):**
   - It uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`. This value is stored in `t`.

4. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The initial result `ans` is set to `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, it doubles the value of `t` and adds it to `ans`, taking modulo `MOD` at each step.

### Verification:
- **Initial Sum (`s`)**: This is straightforward and correctly calculated.
- **Maximum Positive Subarray Sum (`t`)**: This is correctly calculated using Kadane's algorithm.
- **Doubling `t` for Each Operation**: This part ensures that the maximum possible positive contribution from subarrays is maximized. By doubling `t` for each operation, it effectively adds the maximum possible positive subarray sum repeatedly, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the array sum.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- **All Negative Numbers:** If all numbers are negative, `t` will be `0`, and the result will be `s % MOD`, which is correct since no positive subarray sum can be added.
- **Empty Subarray:** If the optimal subarray is empty, `t` will be `0`, and the result will be `s % MOD`.
- **Single Positive Number:** If there's only one positive number, `t` will be that number, and it will be added repeatedly.
- **Multiple Positive Numbers:** The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum subarray sum and adds it repeatedly.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the code appears to handle all edge cases correctly and adheres to the problem description. There doesn't seem to be any scenario where the code would fail to produce the correct result.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations by leveraging Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and then adding this sum repeatedly. It handles various edge cases, including all negative numbers, single positive numbers, and multiple positive numbers, ensuring the result is always maximized and taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
