The code snippet `t *= 2` doubles the value of `t`. Therefore, the new value of `t` will be `2 * t`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `t`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is `(the maximum subarray sum found multiplied by 2 modulo 1000000007) * 2`, `tmp` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD` recalculated to be within the range of 0 to 1000000006, `x` is the last element in the list `a`, `i` is 1**.
