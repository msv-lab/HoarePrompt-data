Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is `(2 times the maximum subarray sum of `a`) % 1000000007; `tmp` is 0; `n` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer read from input where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007; `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to be the remainder when `t` (which is initially 2 times the maximum subarray sum of `a`) is divided by `MOD` (1000000007). All other variables remain unchanged.
