The code snippet `t *= 2` multiplies the current value of `t` by 2. This means the value of `t` is updated to be twice its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `t` was defined as the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during the loop, multiplied by 2, and then taken modulo `MOD`. After executing `t *= 2`, `t` will now be double its previous value.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during the loop multiplied by 4, then taken modulo `MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray with non-negative sums, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(s + 2 * t) % MOD`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
