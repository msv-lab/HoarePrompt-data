The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `s`. The values of `T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `MOD` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.**
