The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given that the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < k - 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Thus, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.

Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
2. The loop condition is `i < k - 1`.
3. To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be updated to the next integer value.

Therefore, if `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be `i + 2` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during the loop multiplied by 4, then taken modulo `MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray with non-negative sums, `n` is the first integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the second integer read from input where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is the new list of `n` integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of all elements in the new list `a`, `ans` is `(s + 3 * t) % MOD`, `i` is `i + 2`**
