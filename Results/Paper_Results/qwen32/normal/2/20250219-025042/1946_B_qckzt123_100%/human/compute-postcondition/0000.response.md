The provided code snippet only defines a constant `MOD` with the value `1000000007`. This does not affect any of the existing variables `t`, `n`, `k`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the addition of the new constant `MOD`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n and k across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. MOD is 1000000007.**
