Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `k` equals 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `sunks` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `k`) retain their original values and constraints.
