Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`. The values of `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged. Additionally, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`. `k` is now `k - a[r] * 2`.**

Natural Language: The value of `k` is reduced by `a[r] * 2`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks`) retain their original values. The condition that `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2` still holds before the reduction, but after the reduction, `k` remains a valid integer.
