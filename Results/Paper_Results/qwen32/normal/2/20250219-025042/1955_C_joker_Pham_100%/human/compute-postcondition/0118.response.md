Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` remains unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `k` is reduced by `a[r] * 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.
