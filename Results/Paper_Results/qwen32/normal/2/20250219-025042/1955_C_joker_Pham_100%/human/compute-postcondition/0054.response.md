Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to the original `a[r] * 2`, then `l` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` was 0, otherwise `l` remains unchanged, `r` is decremented by 1, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`. If `a[l]` was 0, it is set to 0. If `k` is exactly equal to `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. In all other cases, the values of `k`, `a`, `l`, `r` remain unchanged.**
