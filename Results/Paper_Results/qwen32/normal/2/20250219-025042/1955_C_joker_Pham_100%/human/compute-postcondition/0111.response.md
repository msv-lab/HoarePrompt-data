Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The condition involving `l` and `r` is still valid. Since `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `sunks` is incremented by 1.
