You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: `t` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `k` is reduced to the smallest non-negative value possible, `a` is modified based on operations, `l` is incremented until it exceeds `r`, `r` is decremented until it is less than `l`, `sunks` counts the total number of successful operations.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of successful operations, which is stored in the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, a large integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It performs operations to reduce `k` by subtracting twice the smallest element in the list or a combination of elements, while also modifying the list `a`. The function returns the total count of successful operations performed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It also reads the list of durabilities `a` for the ships.
   - The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), representing the first and last ships respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships that have sunk.
   - The main loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r` and there are remaining attacks (`k > 0`).

3. **Handling Attacks**:
   - If `l == r`, it means there's only one ship left. If `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of this ship, it sinks, and the loop breaks.
   - If the durability of the first ship (`a[l]`) is less than or equal to that of the last ship (`a[r]`):
     - If `k` is at least twice the durability of the first ship, it attacks both the first and last ships accordingly, reducing their durability and possibly sinking them.
     - If `k` is exactly twice the durability of the first ship minus one, it sinks the first ship and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it breaks the loop.
   - If the durability of the last ship is less than that of the first ship, similar logic applies but with the roles of the first and last ships reversed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where there is only one ship (`l == r`).
   - It correctly checks whether the remaining attacks `k` are sufficient to sink the first or last ship.
   - The program updates the pointers `l` and `r` appropriately when ships sink.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Attacks**: The program does not handle the scenario where `k` is large enough to continue attacking even after some ships have sunk. It should continue attacking the remaining ships until `k` is exhausted or there are no more ships left.
- **Inefficient Loop Breaks**: The program breaks out of the loop prematurely in some cases, which can lead to incorrect results.
- **Incorrect Sinking Logic**: The logic for sinking ships and updating the pointers `l` and `r` is not robust enough to handle all edge cases, especially when `k` is very large.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
