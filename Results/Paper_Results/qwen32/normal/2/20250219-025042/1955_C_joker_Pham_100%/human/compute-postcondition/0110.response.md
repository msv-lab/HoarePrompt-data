Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `sunks` has been increased by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
