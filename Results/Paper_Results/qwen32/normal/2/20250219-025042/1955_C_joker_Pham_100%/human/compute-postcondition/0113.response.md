Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[l] * 2 - 1 != k`, then `sunks` remains unchanged. In both cases, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
