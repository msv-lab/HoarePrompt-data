Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is `k - a[l] * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 except `a[r]` which is now 0, `l` is equal to `r` or `l` is not equal to `r`, if `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`. Additionally, `a[l]` is less than or equal to the new value of `a[r]` (which is 0). `sunks` is 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `sunks` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
