Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `sunks` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The only change made by the code snippet is that `sunks` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and the condition related to `a[l]`) retain their original values.
