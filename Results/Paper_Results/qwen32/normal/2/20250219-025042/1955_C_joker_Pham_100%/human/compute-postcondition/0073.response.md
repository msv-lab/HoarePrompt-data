Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `k` equals 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `sunks` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged. The variable `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
