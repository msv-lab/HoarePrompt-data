Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is decreased by 1, `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the conditions for breaking out of loops or if statements remain unchanged. If `a[r]` is not 0, then `r` remains unchanged, `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and the conditions for breaking out of loops or if statements remain unchanged.**
