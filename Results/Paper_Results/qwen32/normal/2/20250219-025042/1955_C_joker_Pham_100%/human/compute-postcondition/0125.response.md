Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r - 1`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `r` is decreased by 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `sunks`, `k`, and `r` have their values updated according to the given operations. The `continue` statement means the program will skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration.
