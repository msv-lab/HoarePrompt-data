Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, and `sunks` remains unchanged unless `a[r] == 0`, in which case `l` is less than or equal to `r - 1`, `a[r - 1]` is set to `a[r] - a[l]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
