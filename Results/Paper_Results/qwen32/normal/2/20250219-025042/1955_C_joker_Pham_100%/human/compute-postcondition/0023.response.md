Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is `k - a[l] * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 except `a[r]` which is now either 0 or its original value minus `a[l]`, `l` is equal to `r + 1` or `l` is not equal to `r` (depending on the previous value of `l`), if `l` was equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1` depending on whether `a[r]` became 0 or not. Additionally, `a[l]` is less than or equal to the new value of `a[r]`. `sunks` is 1 or 2.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Thus, all the conditions and values remain unchanged.
