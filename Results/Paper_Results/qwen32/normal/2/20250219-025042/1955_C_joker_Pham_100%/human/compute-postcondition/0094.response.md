To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition specified in the loop head, which is `l <= r`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4,
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5,
- `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

The loop condition `l <= r` must hold true for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` is still less than or equal to `r`.

Since the problem specifies that no changes are made to `l` and `r` within the loop body under the given conditions, we can conclude that if `l` is less than or equal to `r` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop should naturally continue to execute.

Thus, no adjustments are required to the values of `l` and `r` to satisfy the loop condition for another iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
