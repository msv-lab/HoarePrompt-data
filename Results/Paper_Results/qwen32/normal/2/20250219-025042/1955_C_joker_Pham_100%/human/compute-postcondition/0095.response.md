Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
