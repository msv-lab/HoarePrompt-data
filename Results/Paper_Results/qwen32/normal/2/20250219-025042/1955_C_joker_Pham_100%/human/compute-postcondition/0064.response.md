The code snippet provided is:

```python
k -= a[l] * 2
```

This line of code modifies the value of `k` by subtracting twice the value of `a[l]` from it. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `l` must be less than or equal to `r`
- If `k` equals 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
- If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

After executing the line `k -= a[l] * 2`, the value of `k` changes. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged unless `k` reaches 0, which would cause a break in the most internal loop or if statement, but this is not specified to happen here.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2`, and the conditions for breaking out of loops or if statements remain unchanged.**
