To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the line `moves = func_1(nodes, start)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine its exact behavior or the value it returns. However, we can infer that the variable `moves` will be assigned whatever value `func_1` returns.

Given this, the only change in the state will be the introduction of the variable `moves` with the value returned by `func_1`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict with at least one key-value pair, `start` is the integer input from the user, `n` is the total number of nodes in the tree, `t` is the second integer from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes of the tree, `moves` is the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)`**.
