The function checks if there is a cycle in a graph represented by the `nodes` dictionary starting from the `start` node, excluding the `parent` node. It returns `False` if the current node has only one neighbor which is the parent, indicating a dead end or leaf node. Otherwise, it recursively explores the neighbors and returns `True` if any of the recursive calls indicate the presence of a cycle.
