The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. The initial state does not specify any values for `n` and `t`, so after executing the code, `n` and `t` will hold the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= `start` <= n, where n is the total number of nodes in the tree; `n` is the first integer from the input; `t` is the second integer from the input.**
