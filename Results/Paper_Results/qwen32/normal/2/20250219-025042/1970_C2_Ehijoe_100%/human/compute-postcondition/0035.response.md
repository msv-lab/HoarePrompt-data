Postcondition: **`nodes` is a defaultdict with at least one key-value pair, `start` is the integer input from the user, `n` is the total number of nodes in the tree, `t` is the second integer from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes of the tree, and `moves` is the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)`. If `moves` is truthy, then the code proceeds accordingly as per the if part. Otherwise, `moves` is False.**
