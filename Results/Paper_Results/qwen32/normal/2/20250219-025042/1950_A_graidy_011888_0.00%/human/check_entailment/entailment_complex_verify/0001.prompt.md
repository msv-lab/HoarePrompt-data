You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Annotated Code: 
from random import randint

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 1001; `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9 from the last iteration; `res` is determined based on the last values of `x`, `y`, and `z` as per the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates and prints 1000 sets of three random integers between 1 and 9. For each set, it determines and prints whether the sequence forms a 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' based on specific conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description at all. Instead of reading input values and determining whether they form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE", the program generates random numbers and checks conditions on them. This does not align with the problem's requirement to process specific input test cases.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Random Number Generation**: The program uses `randint` to generate random numbers between 1 and 9, which is unrelated to the input provided in the problem description.
2. **Incorrect Conditions**: The program checks if `x < y` and then checks if `y > z` or `y < z`. However, it does not handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` could be equal or if they do not satisfy either the "STAIR" or "PEAK" conditions properly.
3. **Output Mismatch**: The program prints the generated numbers and the result, but it does not read from standard input or produce the required output format for the given test cases.

To make the program correct, it should read the number of test cases and then process each test case by reading three digits and determining if they form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE". Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def determine_shape(a, b, c):
    if a < b < c:
        return "STAIR"
    elif a > b > c:
        return "PEAK"
    else:
        return "NONE"

def main():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        result = determine_shape(a, b, c)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct result according to the problem description.
