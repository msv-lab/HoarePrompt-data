You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case requires printing a specific size of a checkerboard pattern. The program correctly handles the cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 by explicitly printing the corresponding patterns. However, the program does not handle any values of n greater than 4, as indicated by the "else" clause which simply prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in range").

According to the problem description, the value of n can be up to 20. Therefore, the program is incomplete and incorrect because it fails to generate the correct checkerboard pattern for n values from 5 to 20.

To be correct, the program should implement a general algorithm that can generate the checkerboard pattern for any valid n within the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).

Correctness: **False**
