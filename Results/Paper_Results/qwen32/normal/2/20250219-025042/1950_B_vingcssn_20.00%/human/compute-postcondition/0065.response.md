Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is 2.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('##')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('##')
```
This statement explicitly prints the string `'##'`.

### Variables and Objects:
- `t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or objects; it simply outputs the string `'##'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'##'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **##**
