The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'..##'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c`), but these variables are not used within the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Print Statement**: The statement `print('..##')` directly specifies the string to be printed.
2. **Check for Variable Usage**: The string `'..##'` does not contain any variables or expressions that need evaluation. It is a static string.
3. **Determine the Output**: Since the string is static and does not depend on any variables, the output will be exactly `'..##'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **..##**
