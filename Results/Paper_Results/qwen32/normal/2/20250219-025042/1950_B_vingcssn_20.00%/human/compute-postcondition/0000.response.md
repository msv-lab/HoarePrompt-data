The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `casos`. This input represents the number of test cases, `t`, which was previously described as an integer between 1 and 20.

Since the code only affects the variable `casos`, and does not modify `t` or `n`, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `casos` now holds the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `casos` is an input integer.**
