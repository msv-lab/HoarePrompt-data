In this task, we are given the initial state of several variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c`) but the print statement does not depend on any of these variables. The print statement simply outputs the string `'##'`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 20 inclusive.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is set to 2.

However, none of these variables are used within the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'##'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `casos`, or `c`.

Output: **##**
