In this task, we need to determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('##..##')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly outputs the string `'##..##'`. There are no variables or conditions in the `print` statement that depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `casos`, or `c`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is the exact string `'##..##'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **##..##**
