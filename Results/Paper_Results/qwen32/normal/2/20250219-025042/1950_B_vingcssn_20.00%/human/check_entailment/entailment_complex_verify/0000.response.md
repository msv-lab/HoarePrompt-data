### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The program explicitly handles only the cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. For any other value of `n` within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), the program outputs "No esta en el rango". This means that the program fails to generate the required checkerboard pattern for values of `n` greater than 4, which violates the problem's requirements.

The annotations confirm that the program checks for specific values of `n` and prints predefined patterns for those values. For any other value of `n`, it falls into the `else` block and prints "No esta en el rango". This behavior is consistent with the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
