Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is 1.

However, these variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, and `c`) are not used in the provided print statement. The print statement is simply:

```python
print('..##..##')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'..##..##'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `casos`, or `c`.

Output: **..##..##**
