Reasoning:
The given program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case requires printing a specific size of a checkerboard pattern. The program correctly handles the cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 by explicitly printing the corresponding patterns. However, the program does not handle any values of n greater than 4, as indicated by the "else" clause which simply prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in range").

According to the problem description, the value of n can be up to 20. Therefore, the program is incomplete and incorrect because it fails to generate the correct checkerboard pattern for n values from 5 to 20.

To be correct, the program should implement a general algorithm that can generate the checkerboard pattern for any valid n within the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).

Correctness: **False**
