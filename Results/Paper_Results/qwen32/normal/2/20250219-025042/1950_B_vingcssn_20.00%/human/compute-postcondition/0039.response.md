Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `casos` is greater than 0.
- `c` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('##')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('##')
```
This statement directly prints the string `'##'`.

None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `casos`, `c`) are used in the print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is simply the string `'##'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **##**
