The only variable in the loop head is `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `c` relative to `casos`. If `c` is less than `casos`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1 (since the `range` function in Python is exclusive of the stop value). Therefore, `c` should be 2, and it must still be less than `casos`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `casos` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `n` is an input integer, `casos` is greater than 0, and `c` is 2**
