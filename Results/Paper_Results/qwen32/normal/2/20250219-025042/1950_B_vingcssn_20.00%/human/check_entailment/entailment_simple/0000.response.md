### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case requires generating a specific pattern of a checkerboard based on the value of `n`. The program checks the value of `n` and prints the corresponding pattern for `n` values from 1 to 4. However, there is no logic provided for handling values of `n` greater than 4. The program simply prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in range") for any `n` greater than 4.

Given the problem constraints (where `n` can be up to 20), the program is incomplete because it does not handle all possible values of `n` within the specified range. Therefore, the program cannot be considered correct as it fails to produce the required output for `n` values greater than 4.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
