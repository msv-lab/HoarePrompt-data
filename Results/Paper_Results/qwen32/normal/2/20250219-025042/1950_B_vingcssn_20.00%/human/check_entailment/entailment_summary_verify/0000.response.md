### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the provided program. The program explicitly handles only the cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. For any other valid value of `n` (i.e., 5 through 20), the program outputs "No esta en el rango," which is not the expected behavior according to the problem description.

The problem requires the program to generate a checkerboard pattern for any `n` within the range of 1 to 20. Since the current implementation fails to do so for `n` values greater than 4, the program is indeed incorrect.

The function summary aligns with this observation, stating that the function only handles specific cases for `n` equal to 1, 2, 3, and 4, and outputs "No esta en el rango" for other values. This confirms the original assessment's conclusion.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
