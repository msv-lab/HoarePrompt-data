The given initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`) but does not specify their exact values. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on these variables. It simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is described as an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
2. The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1.
3. The variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are described as integers read from the input, but their specific values are not provided.
4. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Draw'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, or `yb`, their values do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
