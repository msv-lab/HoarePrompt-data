The given initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`) but does not indicate any conditions or calculations that would affect the `print('Draw')` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input.
- It is mentioned that `xa` is greater than `xb`.

However, none of these variables influence the `print('Draw')` statement directly. The statement simply prints the string "Draw".

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Draw**
