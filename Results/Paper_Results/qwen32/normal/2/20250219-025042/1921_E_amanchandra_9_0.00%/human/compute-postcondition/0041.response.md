Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives six integers: `h` (height), `w` (width), `x_a`, `y_a` (coordinates of point A), and `x_b`, `y_b` (coordinates of point B). It ensures that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6`, and `1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9`. Additionally, it guarantees that either `x_a ≠ x_b` or `y_a ≠ y_b`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not detailed here.**
