### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find all possible values of `k` such that the `n`-th person in a line gets the number `x` when they are settled in the "first-k-th" position.
- The pattern of settling repeats every `2k-2` positions.
- For a given `k`, the sequence of numbers assigned to people is:
  - First `k` positions: `1, 2, ..., k`
  - Next `k-2` positions: `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`
  - This pattern repeats.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (position) and `x` (number received).

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The code checks if `(n + x)` is odd. If so, it prints `0` because it's impossible for the pattern to match under these conditions.
   - If `(n + x)` is even, it proceeds to find potential `k` values.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with parameters derived from `n` and `x`.
   - `func_1` finds divisors of a computed value that meet specific conditions related to `x`.

4. **Detailed Breakdown of `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` calculates potential `k` values by finding divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` where `y = n + x`.
   - It also considers another set of divisors if `n >= 3 * x - 2`.
   - The divisors must be at least `x - 1` to satisfy the conditions of the problem.

5. **Output:**
   - The code outputs the count of unique `k` values found.

#### Verification Against the Example:
- For the first test case (`n=10`, `x=2`), the code should find `k=2, 3, 5, 6`. The execution summary indicates that the function `func_1` correctly identifies these values.
- For the second test case (`n=3`, `x=1`), the code should find `k=2`. This matches the expected result.
- For the third test case (`n=76`, `x=4`), the code should find `k=4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12`. This matches the expected result.
- For the fourth test case (`n=100`, `x=99`), no valid `k` should be found, which matches the expected result.
- For the fifth test case (`n=1000000000`, `x=500000000`), the code should find `k=500000000`. This matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles edge cases appropriately and produces the expected results for the given examples.

**Correctness:** **True**
