Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The length of `q` is between 1 and 100, inclusive. If `w` equals its integer division by 1 and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing one element, `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.**
