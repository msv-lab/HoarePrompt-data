The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. Given that `i` is 2, the list `M` will have `2` added to it. The values of `q`, `w`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x); `w` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `M` has had `2` appended to it.**
