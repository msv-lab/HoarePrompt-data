### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by determining the possible values of \( k \) that fit the conditions specified in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case individually. Each test case consists of two integers: \( n \) (Vasya's position in the line) and \( x \) (the number Vasya received during the settling).

2. **Initial Check**: For each test case, it calculates \( y = n + x \). If \( y \) is odd, it immediately prints `0` because the settling pattern described requires \( y \) to be even for any valid \( k \).

3. **Finding Possible \( k \) Values**:
   - The program calls `func_1` with two arguments: `(y - 2) // 2` and \( x \). This part of the code is intended to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it also calls `func_1` with `(n - x) // 2` and \( x \) to find additional possible \( k \) values.
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined into a set to ensure uniqueness and then converted back to a list.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It checks if the square root of \( q \) is an integer and adds it to the list of divisors if it meets the condition.
   - It iterates through all integers from 1 to the square root of \( q \) and checks if they are divisors of \( q \). If they are, and if they meet the condition, they are added to the list of divisors.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the number of unique \( k \) values found for each test case.

### Issues and Corrections:

- **Logic Error in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to find divisors of a number \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \). However, the state description provided suggests that `q` is a list of tuples, which is incorrect. `q` should be an integer, not a list of tuples.
- **Condition for Valid \( k \)**: The program correctly identifies that \( k \) must be a divisor of either `(y - 2) // 2` or `(n - x) // 2` and that \( k \) must be greater than or equal to \( x \). However, the logic needs to ensure that \( k \) is within the valid range and satisfies the periodicity condition of the settling pattern.
- **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases where \( n \) and \( x \) are close to their minimum values, ensuring that the calculations do not lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect assumption about the type of `q` in `func_1`, the program is not entirely correct as written. Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the provided code and explanation is:

Correctness: **False**
