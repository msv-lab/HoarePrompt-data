The code snippet initializes an empty list `M`. This does not affect the existing list `q` or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the new list `M`.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The length of `q` is between 1 and 100, inclusive; `M` is an empty list.**
