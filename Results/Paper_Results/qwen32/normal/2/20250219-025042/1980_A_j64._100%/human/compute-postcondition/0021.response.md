Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of the string `a`), `m` (an integer representing the minimum required occurrences of each character type from 'A' to 'G'), and `a` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). The function calculates and returns the total number of additional problems required to ensure that each character type appears at least `m` times in the string `a`. This is done by summing up the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and the count of each character type in the string `a`.**
