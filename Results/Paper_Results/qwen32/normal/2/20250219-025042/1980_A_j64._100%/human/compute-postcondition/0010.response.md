Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `count` is a list of 7 integers where each integer represents the frequency of the corresponding character ('A' to 'G') in the string `a`; `needed_problems` is 0. Additionally, `count[i]` is less than `m`.**
