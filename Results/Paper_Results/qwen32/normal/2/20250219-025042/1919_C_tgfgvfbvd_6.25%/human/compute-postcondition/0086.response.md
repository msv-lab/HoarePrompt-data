Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `y` is 1, `b` is the second element of the list `l`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `n`, `l`, `a`, `y`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
