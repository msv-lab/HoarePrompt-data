Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers derived from the input that must contain at least one element greater than its preceding element, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element, and `y` must be less than `n-1`. Additionally, `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`.**
