The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` relative to `y + 1` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` was some value such that `y + 1 <= x < n`. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be incremented by 1, ensuring that `x` remains within the range `[y + 1, n)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `y` is such that `y + 1 < n`
- `n` is greater than `y + 1`

At the start of the next iteration, `x` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`y` is such that `y + 1 < n`, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `x` is `y + 2`**
