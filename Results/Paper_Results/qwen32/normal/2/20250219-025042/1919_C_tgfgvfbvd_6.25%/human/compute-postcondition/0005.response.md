The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `c` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `a`, `b`) are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is the first element of `l`; `b` is 0; `c` is 0.**
