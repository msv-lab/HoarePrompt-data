Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `y` is such that `y + 1 < n`
- `n` is greater than `y + 1`
- `x` is `y + 2`

Code Snippet:
```python
a = l[x]
```

Here, `a` is assigned the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l`. Since `x` is `y + 2`, the value of `a` will be `l[y + 2]`.

No changes occur to `y`, `n`, or `x`. Only `a` is introduced and assigned a value from the list `l`.

Output State: **`y` is such that `y + 1 < n`, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `a` is `l[y + 2]`**.

This means that `y` remains such that `y + 1` is less than `n`, `n` remains greater than `y + 1`, `x` remains `y + 2`, and `a` is now the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`.
