Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is `a` if `l[y]` is greater than `l[y - 1]`, otherwise `b` remains 0, `c` is 0, and `y` is 0. If `l[y]` is greater than `l[y - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
