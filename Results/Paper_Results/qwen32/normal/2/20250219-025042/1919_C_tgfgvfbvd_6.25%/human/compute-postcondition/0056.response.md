Postcondition: **`y` is such that `y + 1 < n`, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, and `x` is `y + 2`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is increased by 1, and if `l[y + 2] - a >= l[y + 2] - b`, `a` is set to `l[y + 2]`; otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 2]`. If `l[x]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then `l[y + 2]` is set to the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, `l[y + 2]` is set to the minimum of `a` and `b` based on the comparison `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`. Otherwise, `l[y + 2]` is set to the minimum of `a` and `b` based on whether `a` is greater than or equal to `l[y + 2]`.**
