Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either `l[x]` or the first element of `l`, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor (or 0 if no such element exists) or `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `y` is 0, and `n` is the length of the list `l`. The current element `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. If the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`.**
