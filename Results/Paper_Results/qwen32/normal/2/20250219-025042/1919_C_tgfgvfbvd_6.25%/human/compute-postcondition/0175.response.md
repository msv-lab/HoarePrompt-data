Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor (or 0 if no such element exists), `c` is 0, `y` is 0, and `n` is the length of the list `l`. Additionally, `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`. The condition `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` holds true.**
