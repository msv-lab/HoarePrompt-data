The value of `b` is updated to `l[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of `l`, `b` is `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `y` is 0, and `n` is the length of the list `l`. The current element `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. Additionally, `l[x] - a < l[x] - b`.**
