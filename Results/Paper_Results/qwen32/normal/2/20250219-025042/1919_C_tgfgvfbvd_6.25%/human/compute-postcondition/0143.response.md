To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and analyze the variables involved:

- `a` is the smallest element in `l[y+1:n]` that meets the specified conditions.
- `b` is the largest element in `l[y+1:n]` that meets the specified conditions.
- `c` is the count of elements in `l[y+1:n]` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Given these definitions, it seems contradictory for an element to be greater than both `a` (the smallest) and `b` (the largest) within the same sublist `l[y+1:n]`. This implies that there might be no elements that satisfy the condition of being greater than both `a` and `b` simultaneously unless there is a specific condition or context that allows for such a scenario (which isn't provided here).

Therefore, under normal circumstances, the count `c` would be zero because no element can be greater than both the smallest (`a`) and the largest (`b`) element in the same sublist.

Output: **0 (since no element can be greater than both the smallest and the largest element in the sublist)**
