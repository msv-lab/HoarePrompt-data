In the given for loop, the loop variable is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use), and it iterates over a range determined by the integer value of the input.

Given:
- The loop variable `_` does not affect the loop's continuation as it is not used within the loop.
- The loop continues as long as the range generated by `int(input())` has more elements.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- The loop has just finished an iteration, meaning the loop variable `_` has taken on its current value from the range.
- The range is determined by the integer value provided by the user input.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- Since `_` is not used, its value does not matter for the logic of continuing the loop.
- The loop will continue if there are more numbers in the range generated by `int(input())`.

Let's denote the number of iterations already completed as `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `k + 1` iterations would have been completed.

State: **The loop variable `_` can be any value (since it's not used), and the range is determined by the integer input `n` such that `k + 1 < n`.**

However, since we cannot specify the exact value of `_` and we are only concerned with the loop's ability to continue, we can simplify this to:

State: **The range is determined by the integer input `n` such that there are still iterations left to complete, i.e., `k + 1 < n`.**

Since we do not have the specific value of `k` or `n`, we can generalize:

State: **The range is determined by the integer input `n` such that there are still iterations left to complete.**
