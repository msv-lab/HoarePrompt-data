Postcondition: **`y` is such that `y + 1 < n`, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `x` is `y + 2`. After the if-else block, `l[y + 2]` is set to the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then `l[y + 2]` is set to `l[y + 2]` based on the comparison `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`. Otherwise, `l[y + 2]` is set to `l[y + 2]` based on whether `a` is greater than or equal to `l[y + 2]`.**
