Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `s` is a string of length `n - 2 * k - 2` that contains the substring `'p'` instead of `'pie'`; `ans` is `k + 2`.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, making it `k + 2`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
