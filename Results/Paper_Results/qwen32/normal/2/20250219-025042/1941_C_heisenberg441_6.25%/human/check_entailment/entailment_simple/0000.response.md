### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Function Definition and Initial Check**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` is defined to process the string `s`.
   - There is an initial check `if (s == 'mapie') : return 1`. This condition is incorrect because removing one character from 'mapie' to make it beautiful should result in removing two characters (either 'ma' or 'ie'), not one. Therefore, this check is flawed and should be removed.

2. **Removing Substring "map"**:
   - The code uses a `while` loop to repeatedly find and remove occurrences of the substring "map".
   - Each time "map" is found, it is removed by slicing the string around the occurrence of "map" and incrementing the `ans` counter.
   - This part of the code correctly identifies and removes "map" substrings.

3. **Removing Substring "pie"**:
   - Similarly, another `while` loop is used to find and remove occurrences of the substring "pie".
   - Each time "pie" is found, it is removed by slicing the string around the occurrence of "pie" and incrementing the `ans` counter.
   - This part of the code correctly identifies and removes "pie" substrings.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - After all occurrences of "map" and "pie" have been removed, the function returns the `ans` counter, which represents the minimum number of characters that needed to be removed to make the string beautiful.

### Issues Identified:
- The initial check `if (s == 'mapie') : return 1` is incorrect and should be removed. It does not accurately reflect the requirement to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified with the initial check, the program as originally written is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
