Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the removal of overlapping substrings "map" and "pie". It only removes one occurrence of each substring at a time and does not account for new occurrences that might arise after a removal. This can lead to incorrect results when there are overlapping or closely positioned "map" and "pie" substrings.

For example, consider the string "mapiepie". The program would first remove "map", resulting in "iepie", and then remove "pie", resulting in "ie", with a total of 2 deletions. However, the optimal solution is to remove the "pie" first, resulting in "mape", and then remove "map", resulting in "", with a total of 3 deletions. But the problem requires the minimum number of deletions, which in this case is actually 2 by removing the "p" from "map" and the "p" from "pie".

To fix this, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as dynamic programming or using a stack to keep track of characters and ensure that all possible deletions are considered.
