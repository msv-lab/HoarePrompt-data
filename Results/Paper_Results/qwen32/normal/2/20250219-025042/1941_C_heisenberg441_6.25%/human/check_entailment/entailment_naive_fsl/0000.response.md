Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by repeatedly finding and removing the substrings "map" and "pie" from the input string `s` and counting the number of removals. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. 

Consider the following counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
pmapi
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
To make the string "pmapi" beautiful, we can remove the 'a' at index 2, resulting in "pmapi" -> "pmapi" -> "pmapi" -> "pmapi" -> "pmapi" -> "pmp" (removing one character). This results in a beautiful string with only one deletion.

However, the provided program would remove the "map" substring first, resulting in "pmapi" -> "pmi" (two deletions), which is not optimal.

Thus, the program does not always produce the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful, making it incorrect.
