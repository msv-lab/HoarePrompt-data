### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Handling Special Case**: The program checks if the string `s` is exactly `'mapie'` and returns 1 in that specific case. However, this special handling is incorrect because removing one character from `'mapie'` to make it beautiful can be done in multiple ways (e.g., removing 'm' to get `'apie'` or removing 'a' to get `'mpie'`). The correct approach would be to treat `'mapie'` the same way as other strings containing `'map'` and `'pie'`.

2. **Removing Substrings**: The program correctly identifies and removes all occurrences of `'map'` and `'pie'` from the string `s` by using the `find` method to locate these substrings and then slicing the string to exclude them. It increments the counter `ans` for each removal.

3. **Counting Removals**: The program correctly counts the number of removals needed to eliminate all occurrences of `'map'` and `'pie'` from the string `s`.

### Issues Identified:

- The special case handling for `'mapie'` should be removed because it does not accurately reflect the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

### Correctness:

Given the above analysis, the program is mostly correct in its approach to removing substrings and counting the deletions. However, the special case for `'mapie'` should be removed to ensure the program works correctly for all inputs.

Since the special case handling for `'mapie'` is incorrect, we cannot consider the program entirely correct.

**Correctness: False**

However, if we disregard the special case handling for `'mapie'` and assume the rest of the logic is correct, then the core logic of the program is correct. But since the problem statement does not specify any special handling for `'mapie'`, the presence of this special case makes the program incorrect.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**Correctness: False**
