Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\); `s` is a string of length `n - 2 * k` that no longer contains the substring `'map'`, where `k` is the total number of times the substring `'map'` was found and removed; `ans` is `k`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the string `s` will no longer contain the substring `'map'`. The variable `ans` will hold the count of how many times the substring `'map'` was found and removed from the string `s`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The length of `s` will be reduced by 2 for each occurrence of `'map'` that was removed.
