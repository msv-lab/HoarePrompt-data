You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` (though `n` is not used in the logic) and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function is supposed to calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string `s` beautiful.
   - The function first checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If it is, it returns 1. However, this special case is incorrect because "mapie" should require 2 deletions to become beautiful ("mape" or "mie"), not 1. This special case handling is unnecessary and incorrect.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to 0.
   - It then enters a loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "map":
     - `s.find('map')` finds the index of the first occurrence of "map".
     - If found, it removes the "ma" part of "map" by slicing the string around the found index.
     - It increments the counter `ans` by 1 for each removal.
   - Similarly, it enters another loop to find and remove occurrences of the substring "pie":
     - `s.find('pie')` finds the index of the first occurrence of "pie".
     - If found, it removes the "pi" part of "pie" by slicing the string around the found index.
     - It increments the counter `ans` by 1 for each removal.
   - Finally, it returns the counter `ans`, which represents the total number of deletions made.

3. **Issues with the Logic**:
   - The special case for "mapie" being handled incorrectly.
   - The main issue is that the function does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions. It simply removes the first occurrence of "map" or "pie" and continues, which might not be optimal.
   - For example, consider the string "mappppie". The function will first remove "map" and then "pie", resulting in 2 deletions. However, an optimal solution would be to remove the "p" in "map" and the "p" in "pie", resulting in only 2 deletions but in a different way. But the function's approach does not ensure this optimal solution in all cases.
   - Another issue is that the function does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mappie", the function will remove "map" first, leaving "pie", and then remove "pie", resulting in 2 deletions. However, removing the "p" in "map" and the "p" in "pie" would result in only 2 deletions but in a different way. The function's approach does not ensure this optimal solution in all cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not always produce the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
