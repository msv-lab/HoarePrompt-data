### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

1. **Initial Check for Specific Case**:
   ```python
   if (s == 'mapie'):
       return 1
   ```
   This check is incorrect because the problem requires us to find the minimum number of deletions to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie". The string "mapie" should be handled the same way as any other string containing "map" and "pie". Specifically, we should remove "map" and "pie" and count the deletions, rather than returning a fixed value of 1.

2. **Removing Substrings "map" and "pie"**:
   ```python
   while s.find('map') != -1:
       s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
       ans += 1
   while s.find('pie') != -1:
       s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
       ans += 1
   ```
   This part of the code correctly identifies and removes the substrings "map" and "pie" from the string `s` and increments the counter `ans` each time a removal is made. However, the issue with the initial check remains unresolved.

3. **Returning the Result**:
   ```python
   return ans
   ```
   After all occurrences of "map" and "pie" have been removed, the function correctly returns the count of deletions.

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles the specific case where the string is exactly "mapie". It should not return a fixed value of 1 for this case but should instead follow the same procedure of removing "map" and "pie" and counting the deletions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the special handling of the string "mapie".

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
