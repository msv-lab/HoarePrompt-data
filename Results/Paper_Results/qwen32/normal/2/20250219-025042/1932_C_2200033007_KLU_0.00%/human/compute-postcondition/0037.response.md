Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the length of lists `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It also accepts `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'). The function computes and returns the reversed list of cumulative products of elements from the end of an internal list `b` to the start.**
