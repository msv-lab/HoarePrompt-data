Output State: **`b` contains at least one element, `l` is `n` if all elements were taken from the left, otherwise it is the position after the last 'L' was processed, `r` is `-1` if all elements were taken from the right, otherwise it is the position before the last 'R' was processed, `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `p`, `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b`, `p` is `p * v`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `p` has been updated to be the product of its previous value and `v`, which is the next element in the reversed list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
