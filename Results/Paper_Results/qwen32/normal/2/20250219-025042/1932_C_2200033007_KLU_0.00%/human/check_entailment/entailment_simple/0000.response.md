### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. For each command in the string `s`, we need to output the remainder of the product of all elements in the array `a` modulo `m`.
2. Depending on whether the command is 'L' or 'R', we need to remove the leftmost or rightmost element from the array `a`.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to process each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, it initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of `a` in the order determined by the sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands.
   - It also initializes pointers `l` and `r` to point to the leftmost and rightmost elements of `a`, respectively.
   - It iterates over the commands in `s`. If the command is 'L', it appends the element at index `l` to `b` and increments `l`. If the command is 'R', it appends the element at index `r` to `b` and decrements `r`.

3. **Calculating Products:**
   - After constructing `b`, the program calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order.
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store these cumulative products.
   - It initializes `p` to 1 and iterates over `b` in reverse order, updating `p` with the product of the current element and the previous product, and appending `p` to `ans`.

4. **Returning Results:**
   - Finally, the program returns the reversed list `ans`, which should contain the remainders of the cumulative products modulo `m`.

#### Issues in the Given Program:
- The program calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` but does not take the remainder modulo `m` at each step.
- The final result is returned as the reversed list of cumulative products, but it should be the list of remainders of these products modulo `m`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct because it does not compute the remainders of the cumulative products modulo `m` as required by the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**

To fix the program, the line `ans.append(p)` should be changed to `ans.append(p % m)`. This ensures that the remainders are computed at each step.
