The code snippet `b.append(a[l])` appends the element at index `l` of list `a` to list `b`. Given the initial state, the only change is in list `b`, which now includes the element from list `a` at index `l`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the character at index `i` of the string `s` is 'L'; `b` now contains the element `a[l]` appended to it.**
