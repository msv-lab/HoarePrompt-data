Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly implements the solution as per the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array), `m` (the divisor for the modulo operation), the array `a`, and the string `s` of commands.

2. **Command Processing Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process the commands and compute the required remainders.
   - It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array, respectively.
   - It iterates through the commands string `s`. If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element to the list `b` and increments the left pointer `l`. If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element to the list `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.

3. **Product Calculation and Remainder Output:**
   - After collecting the elements in the order they are removed, the program calculates the product of these elements in reverse order.
   - It maintains a running product `p` and appends the result of `p % m` to the list `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed list `ans` to match the order of commands.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the product of elements in the order they were removed but does not compute the product of the remaining elements in the array at each step.
   - The problem requires computing the product of all remaining elements in the array before removing the next element, not just the elements that have been removed.

2. **Modulo Operation Timing:**
   - The modulo operation should be applied at each step when calculating the product of the remaining elements, not just at the end when appending to `ans`.

### Correct Implementation Approach:

To fix the program, we need to:
- Calculate the product of all elements initially.
- Apply the modulo operation at each step.
- Update the product by removing the appropriate element (leftmost or rightmost) based on the command.

### Conclusion:

Given the above issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
