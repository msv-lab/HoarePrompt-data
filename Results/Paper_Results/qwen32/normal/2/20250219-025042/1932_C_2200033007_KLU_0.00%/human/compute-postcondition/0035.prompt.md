Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` contains all elements of `a` in the order determined by the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s`; `l` is `n` if all elements were taken from the left, otherwise it is the position after the last 'L' was processed; `r` is `-1` if all elements were taken from the right, otherwise it is the position before the last 'R' was processed; `ans` is an empty list; `p` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for v in reversed(b):
    p = p * v
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` contains at least one element, `l` is `n` if all elements were taken from the left, otherwise it is the position after the last 'L' was processed, `r` is `-1` if all elements were taken from the right, otherwise it is the position before the last 'R' was processed, `ans` is a list containing the single element `p`, `p` is `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` contains at least one element, `l` is `n` if all elements were taken from the left, otherwise it is the position after the last 'L' was processed, `r` is `-1` if all elements were taken from the right, otherwise it is the position before the last 'R' was processed, `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `p`, `p` is the next element in the reversed list `b` multiplied by `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` contains at least one element, `l` is `n` if all elements were taken from the left, otherwise it is the position after the last 'L' was processed, `r` is `-1` if all elements were taken from the right, otherwise it is the position before the last 'R' was processed, `ans` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `p`, `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b`, `p` is `p * v`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
