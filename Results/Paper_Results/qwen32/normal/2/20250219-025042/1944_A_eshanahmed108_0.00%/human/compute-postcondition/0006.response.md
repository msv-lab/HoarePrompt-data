In the given task, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop iterates based on the value obtained from `int(input())`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation or the state. The loop will continue as long as the number of iterations specified by `int(input())` is greater than zero.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³;
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.

We need to determine how the state should be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. Since the loop's continuation depends on the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`, we need to ensure that this value is decremented by 1 after each iteration.

However, since `t`, `n`, and `k` are not directly involved in controlling the loop's execution, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The loop's execution count is managed internally by the `range` function based on the input value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same for `t`, `n`, and `k`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**
