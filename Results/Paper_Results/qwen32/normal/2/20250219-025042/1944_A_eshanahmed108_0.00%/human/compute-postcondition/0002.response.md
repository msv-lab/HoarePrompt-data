To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the logic step by step:

### Given Code Snippet:
```python
print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (This value is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.

### Analysis:
The `print` statement uses a conditional expression (also known as a ternary operator) to decide what to print:
- If the condition `n - k <= 1` is true, it prints the value of `n`.
- Otherwise, it prints the value `1`.

### Explanation:
- **Condition `n - k <= 1`:** This condition checks whether the difference between `n` and `k` is less than or equal to 1.
  - If `n - k` is 0 or 1, the condition is true, and the code prints `n`.
  - If `n - k` is greater than 1, the condition is false, and the code prints `1`.

### Possible Outcomes:
1. **If `n - k <= 1`:** The output will be the value of `n`.
2. **If `n - k > 1`:** The output will be `1`.

### Final Output Description:
Based on the condition provided in the code snippet, the output will either be the value of `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, or `1` otherwise.

Output: **n if n - k <= 1 else 1 (where n and k are integers read from the input)**
