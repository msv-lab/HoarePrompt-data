Let's break down the given code snippet and determine what will be printed based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This indicates that there are `t` test cases, but it doesn't affect the current print statement directly.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

### Explanation:
The print statement uses a conditional expression (also known as a ternary operator) to decide what to print:
- If the condition `n - k <= 1` is true, it prints the value of `n`.
- Otherwise, it prints the value `1`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `n - k <= 1`:**
   - In this case, the expression evaluates to `True`, so the print statement outputs the value of `n`.

2. **If `n - k > 1`:**
   - In this case, the expression evaluates to `False`, so the print statement outputs the value `1`.

### Output Description:
Given the above conditions, the output will depend on the specific values of `n` and `k`. However, we can precisely describe the output based on the condition:

- If `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, the output will be the value of `n`.
- If `n - k` is greater than 1, the output will be `1`.

Therefore, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **n if n - k <= 1 else 1 (where n and k are integers read from the input)**
