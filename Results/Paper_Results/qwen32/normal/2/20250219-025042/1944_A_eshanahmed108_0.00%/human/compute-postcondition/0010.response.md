Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, for each test case, if `k` is within the range of possible edges in a simple undirected graph with `n` vertices (i.e., 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2), the function returns a valid graph configuration; otherwise, it indicates that such a graph cannot be constructed.**
