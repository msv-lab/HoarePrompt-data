Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is incremented by 1, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, `i` is 4. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is set to 0, `r` is set to `a[4] + k // 5`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `5 * (a[5] - a[4])`, and `r` is set to `a[5]`.**
