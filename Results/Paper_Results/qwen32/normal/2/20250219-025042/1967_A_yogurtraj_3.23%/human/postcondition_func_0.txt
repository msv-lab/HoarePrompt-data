The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the sorted list `a` and the value `k`. The output represents a computed result that depends on how much of `k` can be distributed among the elements of `a` while maintaining a certain order condition.
