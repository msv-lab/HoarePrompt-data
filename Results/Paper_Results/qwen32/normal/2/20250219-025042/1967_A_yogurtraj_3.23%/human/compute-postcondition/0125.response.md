To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the formula used in the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `ii` is incremented by 1 (though `ii` is not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant here).
- `y` is 0.
- `rem` is 0.
- `r` is calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`, where `k` is not equal to 0.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1)
```

Let's substitute `r` with its definition:
\[ r = a[n - 1] + \frac{k}{n} \]

So, the expression inside the print statement becomes:
\[ (r - 1) * n + 1 = \left( a[n - 1] + \frac{k}{n} - 1 \right) * n + 1 \]

Distributing \( n \) inside the parentheses:
\[ = \left( a[n - 1] * n + k - n \right) + 1 \]
\[ = a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 \]

### Simplifying the Expression:
The expression simplifies to:
\[ a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 \]

### Final Output Description:
The print statement will output the value of the expression \( a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 \).

Since the exact values of `a`, `n`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **\( a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 \) (where \( a[n - 1] \) is the last element of the sorted list `a`, \( n \) is an integer greater than 1, and \( k \) is a non-zero integer)**
