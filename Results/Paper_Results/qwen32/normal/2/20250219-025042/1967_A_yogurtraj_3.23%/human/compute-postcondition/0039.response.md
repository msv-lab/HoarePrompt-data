Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n`: An integer greater than 0.
- `a`: A sorted list of integers.
- `r`: Calculated as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
- `rem`: Set to 0.
- `y`: Set to 0.
- `k`: Initially some integer, then reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 2`.
- `k`: Not equal to 0 after reduction.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `r`**:
   - `r` is defined as `a[n - 1] + k // n`.
   - Here, `a[n - 1]` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.

2. **Expression to Print**:
   - The expression to be printed is `(r - 1) * n + 1`.
   - Substituting `r` with its definition: `((a[n - 1] + k // n) - 1) * n + 1`.
   - Simplifying further: `(a[n - 1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1`.

3. **Simplification**:
   - Distribute `n`: `a[n - 1] * n + (k // n) * n - n + 1`.
   - Since `(k // n) * n` is essentially the largest multiple of `n` less than or equal to `k`, it simplifies to `k - rem` where `rem` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n` (which is given as 0).
   - Therefore, `(k // n) * n` is `k` if `k` is a multiple of `n`, otherwise it's `k - rem` which is `k` since `rem` is 0.
   - So, the expression becomes: `a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1`.

### Final Output:
The final expression to be printed is `a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1`.

### Formatted Output:
Output: **a[n - 1] * n + k - n + 1 (where a[n - 1] is the last element of the sorted list `a`, n is the length of the list, and k is the reduced value after the specified summation)**
