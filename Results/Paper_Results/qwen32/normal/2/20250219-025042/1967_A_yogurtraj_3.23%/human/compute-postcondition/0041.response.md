Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `r` is the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n - 1]`).
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `k` is initially set to 0 and then reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 2`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

### Variable Values:
- `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
- `rem` is explicitly given as 0.
- `y` is explicitly given as 0.
- `k` is calculated but not used in the print statement.

### Substituting Values:
Given that `rem` and `y` are both 0, the expression simplifies to:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1)
```

### Explanation:
- `(r - 1)` is the last element of the list `a` minus 1.
- Multiplying this result by `n` scales it according to the number of elements in the list.
- Adding 1 to the result shifts the final value up by 1.

### Final Output:
The final output is the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`.

### Formatted Output:
Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 (where r is the last element of the sorted list `a` and n is the number of elements in the list `a`)**
