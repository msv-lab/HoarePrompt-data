The code snippet sorts the list `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `rem`, `y`, `k`, or `ii`. Only the order of elements in the list `a` changes.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `ii` is incremented by 1.**
