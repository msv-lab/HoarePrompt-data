The code snippet assigns the value of `n - 1 - i` to the variable `y`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `r`, `rem`) are modified by this assignment.

Given the initial state, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has already been incremented by 1 from its previous value). Therefore, `y` will be calculated as `n - 1 - i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`.**
