Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `ii` is incremented by 1, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and the condition ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) <= k) holds true**
