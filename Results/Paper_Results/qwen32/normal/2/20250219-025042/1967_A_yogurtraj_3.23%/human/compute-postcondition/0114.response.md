To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer greater than 5
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `ii` is incremented by 1 (this does not affect `r`)
- `y` is 0
- `rem` is 0
- `i` is 5

The variable `k` is not mentioned in the initial state, so its value is unknown. However, the value of `r` depends on `a[5]` and `k`.

The calculation for `r` involves:
- Accessing the element at index 5 of the list `a`, which is `a[5]`.
- Performing integer division of `k` by `(i + 1)`, which is `k // 6`.

Since `k` is not specified, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `r`. However, we can express `r` in terms of `a[5]` and `k`.

Thus, the updated output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` is incremented by 1, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, `i` is 5, `r` is `a[5] + k // 6`.**
