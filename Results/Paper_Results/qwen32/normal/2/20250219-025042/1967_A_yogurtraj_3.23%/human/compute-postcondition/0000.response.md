In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the input value `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop variable is `ii`, and it ranges from 0 to `t-1`. 

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `t` because it directly influences the range of the loop. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`) are defined within each test case and are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Since the initial state already specifies that `t` is within the valid range (1 <= t <= 100), no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, the state remains as provided, with the understanding that `t` is already set to a value that allows the loop to run.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100**.
