Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `ii` is incremented by 1, `r` is the first element of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that the variable `rem` is explicitly set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
