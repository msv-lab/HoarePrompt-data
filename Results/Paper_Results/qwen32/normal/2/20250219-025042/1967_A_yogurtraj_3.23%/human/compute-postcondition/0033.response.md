Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

Natural Language: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its previous value. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `i`) retain their original values or the updated value of `i` which has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
