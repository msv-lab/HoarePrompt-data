The only variable in the loop head is `ii`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop. The loop iterates `int(input())` times. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `ii` by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer greater than 0
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `rem` is 0
- `y` is 0
- `k` is reduced by the sum of (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) for all i from 0 to n - 2
- If `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`
- If `k` is equal to 0, then `r` remains `a[n - 2]`

Since the loop variable `ii` is the only one that can be adjusted according to the loop head, we increment `ii` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `k` is reduced by the sum of (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) for all i from 0 to n - 2, if `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, if `k` is equal to 0, then `r` remains `a[n - 2]`, `ii` is incremented by 1**
