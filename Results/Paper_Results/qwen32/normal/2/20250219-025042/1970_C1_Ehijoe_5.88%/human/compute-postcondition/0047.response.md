The given code snippet appends the value of `v` to the left end of the `tree` list. This means that `tree` will now have `v` as its first element.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `n` remains an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
- `t` remains 1.
- The tree, which was previously represented by `n-1` edges, now has `v` added to its left end.
- The tree still has exactly two leaves.
- The last line containing `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round remains unchanged.
- `empty` remains False.
- `i` remains 2.
- `u` and `v` remain the integers read from the input, but `v` is now also the first element of the `tree`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges with `v` appended to the left, the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input.**
