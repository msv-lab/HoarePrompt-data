The code snippet `tree.appendleft(u)` adds the integer `u` to the beginning of the list `tree`. This means that the first element of `tree` will now be `u`, and all other elements will shift one position to the right.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `tree`. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `empty`, `i`, `u`, `v`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round, `empty` is False, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input, and `tree` now has `u` as its first element followed by the previous contents of `tree`.**
