Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), an integer `t` which is always 1, and a list of `n-1` edges representing the connections between the nodes. Each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. Additionally, it accepts a list of `t` integers (u_1, ..., u_t) representing the initial positions of a stone for each round, with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The function returns the position of the stone after one round of movement, assuming the stone moves towards a leaf node in each step.**
