The code calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach the start node from either end of the tree, considering two possible paths: one starting from the beginning of the deque (`min(t, idx)`) and the other from the end (`min(t, n - idx - 1)`). 

Given that `t` is 1, the first part of the calculation `min(t, idx)` simplifies to `min(1, idx)`, which will always be 1 if `idx` is greater than 1, otherwise it will be `idx`. Similarly, the second part `min(t, n - idx - 1)` simplifies to `min(1, n - idx - 1)`, which will always be 1 if `n - idx - 1` is greater than 1, otherwise it will be `n - idx - 1`.

Thus, `moves` will be a list containing two elements, each being either 1 or a smaller value derived from `idx` or `n - idx - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by a deque containing a sequence of node IDs from one leaf to the other leaf of the tree, and `empty` is False; `start` is an integer read from input; `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`; `moves` is a list containing `[min(1, idx), min(1, n - idx - 1)]`.**
