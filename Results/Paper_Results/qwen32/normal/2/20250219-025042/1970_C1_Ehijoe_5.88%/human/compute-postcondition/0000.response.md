The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `t`. Given the initial state, `n` is already defined as an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, and `t` is defined as 1. After executing the code, `n` and `t` will be updated to the values read from the input.

Since `t` is specified to be 1 in the initial state, the value of `t` read from the input should match this condition. Therefore, the value of `t` remains 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) with 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n representing the initial positions of the stone for each round.**
