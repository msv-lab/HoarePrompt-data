### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the winner of a game played on a linear tree (since it has exactly two leaves and can be seen as an array). The game starts with a stone on a specified node, and players take turns moving the stone to an adjacent inactive node. The player who cannot make a move loses.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic used in the code:

1. **Tree Representation**: The tree is represented as a deque (double-ended queue) which stores the nodes in a linear order from one leaf to the other. This is achieved by appending nodes to the deque based on their connections.

2. **Initial Position**: The initial position of the stone is read from the input.

3. **Index Calculation**: The index of the initial position of the stone within the deque is determined.

4. **Move Calculation**: Two possible distances are calculated:
   - The distance from the initial position to the leftmost leaf (`idx`).
   - The distance from the initial position to the rightmost leaf (`n - idx - 1`).

5. **Winning Condition**: The game is won by the player who can make the last move. Since the players alternate moves, the player who starts (Ron) wins if the total number of moves (either to the leftmost or rightmost leaf) is odd. Otherwise, Hermione wins.

6. **Output**: Based on the parity of the minimum of these two distances, the winner is determined and printed.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Tree Construction**: The tree is correctly constructed as a deque, ensuring that the nodes are stored in a linear order from one leaf to the other.
- **Index Calculation**: The index of the starting node is correctly found within the deque.
- **Move Calculation**: The distances to the two leaves are correctly calculated.
- **Winning Condition**: The check for the parity of the minimum distance is correct. If either distance is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

### Conclusion:

The logic implemented in the code correctly determines the winner based on the rules of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
