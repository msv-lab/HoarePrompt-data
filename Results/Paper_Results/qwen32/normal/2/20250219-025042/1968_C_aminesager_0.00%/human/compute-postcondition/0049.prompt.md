Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
    a = a[::-1]
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is the reversed list of `[1000, 1000 - T[0], 1000 - T[0] - T[1], ..., 1000 - sum(T)]; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 1`; `n` must be greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`; `T` is a list of integers derived from the string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[(1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])), ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1]), (1000 - T[0]), 1000]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the new input string provided by the user.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is at least 0; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`; `T` is a list of integers derived from the new input string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[(1000 - sum(T[:n-1])), ..., (1000 - T[0]), 1000]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the new input string provided by the user; `i` is `n-1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
