To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given Initial State:
- `t` is at least 0
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`
- `T` is a list of integers derived from the new input string `line` split and converted to integers
- `a` is `[1000]`
- `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`
- `line` is the new input string provided by the user

Code Snippet:
```python
a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
```

The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `a` was initially `[1000]`.
- After executing the code, `a` will have one more element appended to it, which is `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.

Since `a` initially contains only one element (`1000`), `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[0]` (which is `1000`). Therefore, the new element being appended is `1000 - T[i - 1]`.

Thus, the updated list `a` will be `[1000, 1000 - T[i - 1]]`.

No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500`; `T` is a list of integers derived from the new input string `line` split and converted to integers; `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[i - 1]]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the new input string provided by the user.**
