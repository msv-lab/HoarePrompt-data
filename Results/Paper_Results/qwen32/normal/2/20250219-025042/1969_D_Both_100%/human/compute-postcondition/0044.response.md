The code snippet `item = combined.pop()` removes the last element from the `combined` list and assigns it to the variable `item`. Given the initial state, `combined` has one element, so after this operation, `combined` will become an empty list.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `heap` remains empty.
- `k` remains 0.
- `n` remains the first value returned by `func_2()`.
- `prices` remains the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` remains a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`.
- `bonuses` remains the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `remaining_items` remains an empty list.
- `test_cases` remains greater than 0.
- `combined` becomes an empty list because the only element was popped.
- `item` is now the element that was previously the last element of `combined`.
- `removed_item` remains equal to `item` since `item` was just reassigned to the last element of `combined`.

No changes occur to `current_profit`, `max_profit`, or any other variables not explicitly mentioned in the code snippet.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list in the order they were popped (which is still 0, so it remains empty); `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `combined` is an empty list; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`; `removed_item` is equal to `item`.**
