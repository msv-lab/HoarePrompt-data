Postcondition: **`heap` is empty; `combined` has at least one tuple (one less than before); `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is `0`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`; the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is less than 0**
