The code snippet reassigns the `prices` variable with the list returned by `func_2()`. This means the previous value of `prices` (which was also the list returned by `func_2()`) is overwritten by the new list returned by `func_2()`. Since `neg_prices` is derived from `prices`, its values would no longer correspond to the current `prices` unless recalculated. However, the code does not modify `neg_prices` in this snippet. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in the previous `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 1; `combined` is an empty list; `current_profit` reflects the net profit after processing all items; `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered during the loop.`**

Natural Language: The `prices` variable has been updated to the list returned by `func_2()`. All other variables retain their previous values, including `neg_prices`, which still holds the negatives of the previous `prices` list.
