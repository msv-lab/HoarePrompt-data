The code sorts the `combined` list based on the second element of each tuple (which corresponds to the values in the `bonuses` list). This operation does not affect the values of `heap`, `k`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases`, `current_profit`, or `max_profit`. It only changes the order of the tuples in the `combined` list.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is `k_value`; `combined` is a list of tuples formed by zipping `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0.**
