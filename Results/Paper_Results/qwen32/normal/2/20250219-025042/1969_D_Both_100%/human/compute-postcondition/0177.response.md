The code snippet `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` reduces the value of `current_profit` by the first element of the `removed_item` tuple.

Given the initial state, `current_profit` is updated by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`heap` contains `item` and the smallest element from the original `heap` is replaced by `item`; `removed_item` is the smallest element from the original `heap`; `combined` contains at least one more tuple; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`; If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is updated to `(current_profit - removed_item[0]) + item[0]`. `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. `current_profit` is now `current_profit - removed_item[0]`.**
