Output State: **`heap` contains the `item`; `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `combined` is not an empty list (excluding the last element); `item` is the second-to-last element that was in `combined` before the pop operation; `removed_item` is equal to the last element that was in `combined` before the pop operation; if `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[0]`; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The last element from the `combined` list is removed and assigned to `removed_item`. The new `item` is now the second-to-last element from the `combined` list before the removal. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
