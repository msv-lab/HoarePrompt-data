The code snippet `prices = list(func_2())` updates the `prices` variable by assigning it the list returned by the function `func_2()`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice receives from selling items to Bob, `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and bonus of an item, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
