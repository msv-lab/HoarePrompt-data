The code sorts the `combined` list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple (which is the bonus). This sorting does not affect the other variables (`heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `test_cases`). 

Since the sorting is based on the bonus, the order of the tuples in `combined` will change such that the tuples with smaller bonuses come before those with larger bonuses.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple (bonus), `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
