The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` removes the last tuple from the `combined` list (since `combined` is sorted by the second element of each tuple, this will be the tuple with the largest second element) and pushes it onto the `heap`. 

Given the initial state, `heap` was initially an empty list, and `combined` is a non-empty list of tuples. After executing the code, `heap` will contain one tuple, which is the one that was popped from `combined`.

Output State: **`heap` is a list containing the tuple that was the last element of `combined`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()` and must be greater than 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 1; `combined` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, with the last tuple removed; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0.**
