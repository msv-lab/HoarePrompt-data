The code snippet reassigns the `bonuses` variable with the list returned by `func_2()`. This means the previous value of `bonuses` is overwritten with the new list returned by `func_2()`.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 1; `combined` is an empty list; `current_profit` reflects the net profit after processing all items; `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered during the loop.`**

In simpler terms, the `bonuses` list has been updated to the new list returned by `func_2()`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
