You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Output

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
- Alice and Bob are playing a game with `n` items.
- Each item has two prices: `a_i` (price for Alice) and `b_i` (price for Bob).
- Alice wants to maximize her profit, defined as the difference between what Bob pays her and what she spends.
- Bob can either take all items for free if Alice buys less than `k` items or take `k` items for free and pay for the rest.
- Both players act optimally.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading Functions (`func_1` and `func_2`)**:
   - `func_1`: Reads an integer from the input.
   - `func_2`: Reads a line of integers from the input.

2. **Profit Calculation Function (`func_3`)**:
   - This function calculates the total profit based on the items Alice keeps and the items in the heap (which Bob will take for free).
   - It sums up the costs of items in the heap and adds the net profit (if any) from the items Alice keeps.

3. **Main Logic (`func_4`)**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - Initializes a heap and a list of remaining items.
     - Reads `n`, `k`, the list of `a_i` values, and the list of `b_i` values.
     - Combines the negative `a_i` values and `b_i` values into tuples and sorts them by `b_i`.
     - Pushes the first `k` items into the heap (these are the items Bob will take for free if Alice buys at least `k` items).
     - Calculates the initial profit if Alice buys more than `k` items.
     - Iteratively updates the profit by considering each remaining item:
       - Adjusts the current profit based on whether the item is beneficial for Alice to keep.
       - Updates the heap and recalculates the profit.
     - Prints the maximum profit found.

### Key Points:
- The program uses a heap to efficiently manage the `k` items Bob will take for free.
- It iteratively evaluates the profit for different subsets of items Alice could buy.
- The sorting by `b_i` ensures that items with higher potential profit for Alice are considered first.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as when `k` is zero or when `k` equals `n`.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the program seems to be correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
