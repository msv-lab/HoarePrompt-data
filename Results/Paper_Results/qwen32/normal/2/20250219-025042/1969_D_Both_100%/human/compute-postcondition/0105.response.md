Output State: **`heap` contains the elements of the original `heap` with `item` added and the smallest element removed; `k` is 1; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases` remain unchanged; `combined` has one less element than before; `current_profit` is adjusted based on the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` and is now `current_profit - removed_item[0]` if `removed_item` is truthy; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.**

In simple terms, the only change is that `max_profit` is now set to the value of `current_profit`. All other variables retain their previous states and values.
