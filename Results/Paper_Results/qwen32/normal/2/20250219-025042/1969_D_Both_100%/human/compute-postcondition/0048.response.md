Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

- `heap` is initially empty.
- `k` is 0.
- `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items`, `test_cases`, `combined`, `item`, and `removed_item` are all defined with specific conditions.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
```

Since `heap` is initially empty, `heapq.heappushpop` will first push `item` onto the heap and then pop the smallest element from the heap. Given that the heap was empty before the operation, the smallest element will be `item` itself.

Therefore, `removed_item` will be equal to `item`.

The state of `heap` after this operation will contain one element, which is `item`.

Output State: **`heap` contains the `item`; `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `combined` is an empty list; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`; `removed_item` is equal to `item`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`.**
