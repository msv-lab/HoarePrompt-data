The code snippet assigns the result of `list(func_2())` to the variable `prices`. This means `prices` will now hold the list returned by `func_2()`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list; `k` is `k_value`; `combined` is empty; `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `current_profit` is the net profit after processing all items; `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the loop.**
