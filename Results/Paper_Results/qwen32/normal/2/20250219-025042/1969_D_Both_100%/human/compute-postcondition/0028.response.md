Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list in the order they were popped; `k` is 0; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is greater than 0. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
