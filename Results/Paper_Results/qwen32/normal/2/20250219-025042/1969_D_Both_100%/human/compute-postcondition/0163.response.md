Postcondition: **`heap` is empty; `combined` has at least one tuple (one less than before); `n` is `n_value`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and still greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`. If the sum of the elements of `item` (`item[0] + item[1]`) is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is `-item[1]`. If the sum of the elements of `item` is less than 0, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `current_profit` is `item[0]`. `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
