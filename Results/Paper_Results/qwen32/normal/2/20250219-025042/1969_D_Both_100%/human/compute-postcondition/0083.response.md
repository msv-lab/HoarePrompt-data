The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `k`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only variable we need to adjust is `k`.

According to the problem statement, `k` is initially set to the second value returned by `func_2()` minus 1 and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be greater than 0. At the start of each iteration, `k` is decremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `k` must have been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration (since it will be decremented to 0 at the end of this iteration, which would terminate the loop).

State: **`heap` contains the previously last element of `combined` (if `combined` was not empty before) plus the new last element of `combined` after the pop operation if `combined` is not empty. If `combined` is empty, `heap` remains unchanged. `combined` has one less element than before if it was not empty. `k` is 1. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list of integers where each integer is the negative of the corresponding integer in `prices`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `test_cases` is greater than 1. `current_profit` is 0. `max_profit` is 0.**
