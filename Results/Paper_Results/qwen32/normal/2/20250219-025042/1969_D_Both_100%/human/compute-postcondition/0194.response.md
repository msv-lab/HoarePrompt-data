Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but uses several global variables including `heap` (a list used as a min-heap), `remaining_items` (a list of unprocessed items), `n` (an integer representing the number of items), `k` (an integer representing the number of items Bob can take for free), `prices` (a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice), `neg_prices` (a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice), `bonuses` (a list of integers representing the bonuses Alice receives from selling items to Bob), `max_profit` (an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve), `current_profit` (an integer representing the current profit Alice has), and `combined` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price and bonus of an item). The function calculates and returns the maximum profit Alice can achieve by strategically selling items to Bob, taking into account the bonuses she receives and the fact that Bob can take up to `k` items for free.**
