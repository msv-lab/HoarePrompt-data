To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet in the context of the initial state provided.

Given:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same.
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'.
- `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `0`.
- `el` is the first character of `s1`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'.
- `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', `2 * n` if `el` is not '>'.
- `oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`

We need to understand what `func_1` does. Since `func_1` is not defined in the problem, we'll assume it's a function that returns the element at the index specified by its second argument from the list specified by its first argument. This is a common behavior for such functions.

Let's analyze the code snippet:

```python
oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
```

If `zr` is `0` (which means `el` is '>'):
- `func_1(preOne, 0)` will return the first element of `preOne`, which is `0`.
- `func_1(preOne, 1)` will return the second element of `preOne`.

If `zr` is `1` (which means `el` is not '>'):
- `func_1(preOne, 1)` will return the second element of `preOne`.
- `func_1(preOne, 2)` will return the third element of `preOne`.

Since `preOne` starts with `0` and the rest are cumulative sums of `pre`, the second element of `preOne` is the first element of `pre`, and the third element of `preOne` is the sum of the first two elements of `pre`.

Thus:
- If `el` is '>', `oneInd` will be `0 + pre[0]` (if `pre` has at least one element).
- If `el` is not '>', `oneInd` will be `pre[0] + pre[1]` (if `pre` has at least two elements).

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `0`; `el` is the first character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'; `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', `2 * n` if `el` is not '>'; `oneInd` is `pre[0]` if `el` is '>', `pre[0] + pre[1]` if `el` is not '>' and `pre` has at least two elements.**
