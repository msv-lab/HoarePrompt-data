Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed, `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd` if `ol <= zr` and `ans[n-1]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` otherwise, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is equal to '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne` plus 1, `zr` is equal to `0`, `zeroInd` is `2 * result_func_1` if `ol <= zr` and `0` otherwise, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr` and `0` otherwise, `fi` is the first element of `pre` if `ol > zr`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `totalOne` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
