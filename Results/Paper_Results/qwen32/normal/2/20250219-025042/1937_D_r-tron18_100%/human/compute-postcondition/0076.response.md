To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, we focus on the variable `oneInd` which is being updated. The code snippet is:

```python
oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
```

Given the initial state, `oneInd` is recalculated using the function `func_1` with arguments `preOne` and `zr`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot compute the numerical value of `oneInd` directly. However, we can express `oneInd` in terms of the function call.

The other variables remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified in the code snippet provided. Hereâ€™s the updated state:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, 2]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `el` is the second character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `1`; `zeroInd` is `2`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`; `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**
