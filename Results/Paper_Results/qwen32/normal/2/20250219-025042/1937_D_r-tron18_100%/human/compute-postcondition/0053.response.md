Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'
- `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'
- `suffZero` is `[0, 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise `[0, n, n+1]`
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is `0`
- `el` is the first character of `s1`
- `ol` is `totalOne`
- `zr` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `2`
- `zeroInd` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `2n + 1`
- `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`

Code Snippet:
```python
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
- Since `i` is `0`, `ans[0]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.

Output State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'
- `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'
- `suffZero` is `[0, 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise `[0, n, n+1]`
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[0]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` and `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is `0`
- `el` is the first character of `s1`
- `ol` is `totalOne`
- `zr` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `2`
- `zeroInd` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `2n + 1`
- `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`
