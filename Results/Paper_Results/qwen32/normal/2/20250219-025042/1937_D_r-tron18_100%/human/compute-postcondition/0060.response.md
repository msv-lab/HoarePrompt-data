The code snippet `el = s1[i]` updates the variable `el` to the character at index `i` in the string `s1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `el` will now hold the second character of the string `s1`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `el` is the second character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne + 1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on conditions; `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**
