To determine the new output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and how it affects the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
```

Given the initial state, we know:
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions.
- `i` is 1.
- `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol > zr`.

After executing the line `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd`, the value of `ans[1]` will be updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions and `ans[1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `el` is the second character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol > zr`; `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**
