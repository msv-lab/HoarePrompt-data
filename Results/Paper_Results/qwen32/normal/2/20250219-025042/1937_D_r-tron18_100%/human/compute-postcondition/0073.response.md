The code snippet appends a new value to the `suffZero` list. Specifically, it adds the last element of `suffZero` plus `i` plus `1`. Given that `i` is `1` and the last element of `suffZero` is `0` (since `el` is not specified to be `'>'`, we assume the initial state where `suffZero` is `[0]`), the new value added will be `0 + 1 + 1 = 2`.

Thus, the `suffZero` list, which was initially `[0]`, will now be `[0, 2]`.

No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, 2]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `el` is the second character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne + 1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on conditions; `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**
