To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and how the variables are defined:

1. **s1**: This is the original string, but its specific content is not provided.
2. **pre**: This is a list of indices where the character '>' appears in the string `s1`.
3. **totalOne**: This is initialized to 0 and presumably used to count occurrences of '>' characters.
4. **preOne**: This is initialized to `[0]` and seems to store cumulative counts of '>' characters up to each index in `s1`.
5. **suffZero**: This is a list of cumulative sums of indices where the character '<' appears in the string `s1`.
6. **ans**: This is a list of integers calculated based on certain loop conditions, but the specific calculation logic is not provided.

Given the information, we know that `ans` is a list of integers, but without the specific logic for how `ans` is populated, we cannot determine the exact numerical values it contains. However, we can describe the output in terms of what `ans` represents.

Since the `print(*ans)` statement uses the unpacking operator `*`, it will print each element of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

### Explanation of `ans`:
- `ans` is a list of integers that are calculated based on some conditions involving the counts of '>' and '<' characters in the string `s1` and their respective indices.
- Without the specific loop and calculation details, we can only say that `ans` contains integers derived from these counts and indices.

### Final Output:
Given the lack of specific details about the contents of `ans`, the most precise description we can provide is that `ans` contains integers calculated based on the described conditions.

Output: **[contents of ans] (where ans is a list of integers calculated based on the counts of '>' and '<' characters and their indices in the string s1)**
