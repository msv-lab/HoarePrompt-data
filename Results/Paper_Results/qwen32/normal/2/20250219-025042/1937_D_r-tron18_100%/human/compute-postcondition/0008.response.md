Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is equal to '>'; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `0`.**

Explanation: The variables `ol` and `zr` have been updated. `ol` is assigned the value of `totalOne`, and `zr` is assigned the value of `len(suffZero) - 1`, which is `0` since `suffZero` contains only one element (`0`). All other variables remain unchanged.
