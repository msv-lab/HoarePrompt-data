The given code snippet updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the current values of several variables. Here's the updated state after the code execution:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is the last character of `s1` and `el` is equal to '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `0`, `zeroInd` is `0`, `oneInd` is `0`, `fi` is the first element of `pre`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans[i]` (where `i` is `n-1`) is now calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
