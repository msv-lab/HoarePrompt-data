The code snippet assigns the value `2 * preOne[-1]` to the variable `oneInd`. This means that `oneInd` is now twice the value of the last element in the list `preOne`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `oneInd` is updated to `2 * preOne[-1]`.
- All other variables retain their initial values unless they are directly impacted by the code.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise `[0, n, n+1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `0`; `el` is the first character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `2`; `zeroInd` is `2` if `el` is '>' and `totalOne + 1` is 2, or `0` if `el` is '>' and `totalOne + 1` is 1, or `4n + 2` if `el` is not '>' and `totalOne + 1` is 3, or `2n` if `el` is not '>' and `totalOne + 1` is 2, or `0` if `el` is not '>' and `totalOne + 1` is 1; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.**
