The code snippet `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`.

Given the initial state, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is `'>'`. After executing `preOne.pop()`, the last element of `preOne` is removed.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed twice if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions. Specifically, if `ol <= zr`, then `ans[1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`; otherwise, `ans[1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `el` is the second character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` if `ol > zr`, otherwise `0` if `el` is `'>'`, otherwise `2 * n`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol > zr`, otherwise `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**

In simpler terms, the last element of `preOne` has been removed, affecting the cumulative sums stored in `preOne`. All other variables remain unchanged.
