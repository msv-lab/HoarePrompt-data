To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same.
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'.
- `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `0`.
- `el` is the first character of `s1`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'.
- `zeroInd` is `2 * result_func_1`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - result_func_1`.

The code snippet:
```python
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
```

This line updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. Since `i` is `0`, `ans[0]` is updated.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[0]` which is `2 * result_func_1 - (2 * preOne[-1] - result_func_1)`; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `0`; `el` is the first character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'; `zeroInd` is `2 * result_func_1`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - result_func_1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans[0]` is now `2 * result_func_1 - (2 * preOne[-1] - result_func_1)`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
