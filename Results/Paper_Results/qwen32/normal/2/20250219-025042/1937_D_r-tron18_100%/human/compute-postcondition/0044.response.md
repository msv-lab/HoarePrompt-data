To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet provided is:
```python
fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
```

Here, `fi` is being assigned the result of the difference between two calls to `func_1`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we will assume it performs some operation based on the inputs `preOne` and `zr`.

Given the initial state, the variables `preOne`, `zr`, and `fi` are relevant to this operation:
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'.
- `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'.
- `fi` is being calculated and will hold the result of the difference between two calls to `func_1`.

Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `fi`. However, we can express `fi` in terms of the function calls.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `fi` is now assigned the value `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `0`; `el` is the first character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', `1` if `el` is not '>'; `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', `2 * n` if `el` is not '>'; `oneInd` is `pre[0] - result` if `el` is '>', or `(pre[0] + pre[1]) - result` if `el` is not '>' and `pre` has at least two elements; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.**
