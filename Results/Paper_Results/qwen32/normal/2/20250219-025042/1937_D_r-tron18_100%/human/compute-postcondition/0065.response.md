The given code snippet updates the value of `zeroInd` based on the value of the last element in the `suffZero` list. Since `suffZero` is either `[0]` or `[0, n]` depending on whether `el` is `'>'` or not, the last element of `suffZero` will be `0` if `el` is `'>'` and `n` if `el` is not `'>'`.

Given this, `zeroInd` will be set to `2 * suffZero[-1]`, which means:
- If `el` is `'>'`, `suffZero[-1]` is `0`, so `zeroInd` becomes `2 * 0 = 0`.
- If `el` is not `'>'`, `suffZero[-1]` is `n`, so `zeroInd` becomes `2 * n`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `el` is the second character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is `'>'`, otherwise `2 * n`; `oneInd` is calculated based on conditions; `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**
