To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given Code Snippet:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
```

We need to know what `func_1` does. Since `func_1` is not defined in the problem statement, let's assume it's a function that returns an element from the list `suffZero` based on the index provided (as this is a common pattern when dealing with prefix/suffix sums).

Let's assume `func_1(lst, idx)` returns `lst[idx]`.

Given:
- `suffZero` is `[0, n]`
- `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`

Since `ol` is the number of '>' characters and `suffZero` is `[0, n]`, `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` would be `func_1([0, n], ol + 1)`. However, since `ol + 1` might be out of bounds for the list `[0, n]`, we should consider the possible values:

- If `ol + 1` is 1, `func_1(suffZero, 1)` would be `n`.
- If `ol + 1` is 2, `func_1(suffZero, 2)` would be out of bounds, but since `ol` is the count of '>' characters and cannot exceed `n`, `ol + 1` being 2 means `ol` is 1, and `func_1(suffZero, 2)` is not applicable here.

So, let's assume `ol + 1` is 1, which means `ol` is 0. This is the simplest and most logical assumption given the constraints.

Thus:
- `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` is `func_1([0, n], 1)` which is `n`.
- `func_1(suffZero, 1)` is `func_1([0, n], 1)` which is `n`.

Therefore:
- `zeroInd = 2 * n - n = n`

Now, let's update the output state with the new value of `zeroInd`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, `suffZero` is `[0, n]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `zr` is greater than `ol`; `zeroInd` is `n`.**
