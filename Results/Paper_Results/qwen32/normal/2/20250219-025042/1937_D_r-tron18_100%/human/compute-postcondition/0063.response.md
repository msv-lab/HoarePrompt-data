To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
```

This line calculates the new value of `oneInd`. Let's break down the components:

1. `preOne[-1]`: This refers to the last element of the list `preOne`.
2. `func_1(preOne, 1)`: This calls a function `func_1` with `preOne` and `1` as arguments. The exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, but we can assume it returns some value based on these inputs.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is `'>`.
- `func_1` is a function whose behavior is not explicitly defined, but it takes two arguments and returns a value.

Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not provided, we can't compute its exact return value. However, we can express `oneInd` in terms of `preOne` and the result of `func_1`.

Thus, the new value of `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `el` is the second character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol > zr`; `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**
