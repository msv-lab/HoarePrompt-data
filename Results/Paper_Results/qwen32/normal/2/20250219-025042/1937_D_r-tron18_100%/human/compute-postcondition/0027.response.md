To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given line of code in the context of the provided initial state:

```python
oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
```

Here, `oneInd` is being assigned a value which is twice the result of the function `func_1` called with arguments `preOne` and `zr`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot compute its exact return value. However, we can express `oneInd` in terms of the function's output.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `oneInd`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, `suffZero` is `[0, n]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `el` is the last character of `s1`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `ol` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `zr` is 1 and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`; `zeroInd` is `n`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**.
