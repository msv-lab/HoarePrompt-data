To determine the new state after executing the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the changes made to the variables.

Given:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same.
- `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'.
- `suffZero` is `[0, 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise `[0, n, n+1]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `0`.
- `el` is the first character of `s1`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `2`.

The line of code to execute:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
```

We need to understand what `func_1` does. Since `func_1` is not defined in the problem statement, we'll assume it performs some operation on the list `suffZero` and the integer passed as the second argument. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume `func_1(lst, k)` returns the sum of the first `k` elements of `lst`.

Let's calculate the new value of `zeroInd` based on the assumptions:

1. **If `el` is '>'**:
   - `suffZero` is `[0, 1]`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne` (number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1).
   - `zr` is `1`.

   Let's assume `totalOne` is `t` (where `t` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1).

   - `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` would be the sum of the first `t + 1` elements of `suffZero`. Since `suffZero` only has two elements `[0, 1]`, this would be `0 + 1 = 1` if `t + 1` is 2, or just `0` if `t + 1` is 1.
   - `func_1(suffZero, 1)` would be the sum of the first element of `suffZero`, which is `0`.

   Therefore, `zeroInd` would be `2 * 1 - 0 = 2` if `t + 1` is 2, or `2 * 0 - 0 = 0` if `t + 1` is 1.

2. **If `el` is not '>'**:
   - `suffZero` is `[0, n, n+1]`.
   - `ol` is `totalOne` (number of '>' characters in `s1`).
   - `zr` is `2`.

   Let's assume `totalOne` is `t` (where `t` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`).

   - `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` would be the sum of the first `t + 1` elements of `suffZero`. This could be `0 + n + (n + 1)` if `t + 1` is 3, or `0 + n` if `t + 1` is 2, or just `0` if `t + 1` is 1.
   - `func_1(suffZero, 1)` would be the sum of the first element of `suffZero`, which is `0`.

   Therefore, `zeroInd` would be `2 * (0 + n + (n + 1)) - 0 = 2 * (2n + 1) = 4n + 2` if `t + 1` is 3, or `2 * (0 + n) - 0 = 2n` if `t + 1` is 2, or `2 * 0 - 0 = 0` if `t + 1` is 1.

Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we'll consider both cases and express `zeroInd` in terms of `t` and `n`.

### Output State:
- If `el` is '>' and `totalOne` is `t`:
  - `zeroInd` is `2` if `t + 1` is 2, or `0` if `t + 1` is 1.
- If `el` is not '>' and `totalOne` is `t`:
  - `zeroInd` is `4n + 2` if `t + 1` is 3, or `2n` if `t + 1` is 2, or `0` if `t + 1` is 1.

However, without the exact definition of `func_1`, we can't definitively say which case applies. We'll assume the simplest non-trivial case for demonstration purposes.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise `[0, n, n+1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `0`; `el` is the first character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `2`; `zeroInd` is `2` if `el` is '>' and `totalOne + 1` is 2, or `0` if `el` is '>' and `totalOne + 1` is 1, or `4n + 2` if `el` is not '>' and `totalOne + 1` is 3, or `2n` if `el` is not '>' and `totalOne + 1` is 2, or `0` if `el` is not '>' and `totalOne + 1` is 1.**
