To determine the new output state after executing the given line of code, we need to focus on the changes made to the variables. Specifically, the line:

```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

This line calculates a new value for `zeroInd` using the function `func_1` with `suffZero` and `ol` as arguments. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we'll assume it returns a specific value based on its inputs.

Let's break down the known values and the impact of the line of code:

- `suffZero` is a list containing either `[0]` or `[0, n]` depending on whether `el` is `'>'` or not.
- `ol` is `totalOne`, which is the number of `'>'` characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is `'>'`, otherwise it remains the same.

Given these, the value of `zeroInd` will be `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`. Without knowing the exact implementation of `func_1`, we can't determine the numerical value of `zeroInd`, but we can express it in terms of `func_1`.

The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly impacted by the line of code, which they are not.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of indices (plus one) of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that point, except the last element has been removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the single element `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on certain conditions; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `el` is the second character of `s1`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`; `oneInd` is calculated based on conditions; `fi` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**
