Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- The current value of `n` is equal to `k`.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` have specific constraints but do not affect the execution of the `print` statement directly.
2. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`, the output will always be `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the code is:
Output: **YES**
