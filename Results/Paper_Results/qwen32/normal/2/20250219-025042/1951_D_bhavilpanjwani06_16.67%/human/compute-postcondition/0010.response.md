Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are integers where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k` (\(n \geq k\)).
- `n` is not equal to `k` (\(n \neq k\)).
- The current value of `k` satisfies the condition \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\).

### Print Statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the content of the print statement itself. The conditions are constraints on the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`, but they do not influence the literal string `'YES'` that is being printed.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
