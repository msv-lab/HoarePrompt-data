You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    elif n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(n)
    elif k - 1 < n - k + 1:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(n - k + 1, 1)
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input and prints "YES" followed by specific values if `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and certain conditions are met. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step against the problem requirements:

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices so that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins.
2. **Constraints**:
   - Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next.
   - Each stall can have an unlimited supply of jewels.
   - The price per jewel at each stall is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program only handles three specific scenarios:
1. If `n < k`: It prints "NO" because Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy `k` jewels.
2. If `n == k`: It prints "YES" and sets up one stall with the price equal to `n`. This ensures Alice buys exactly one jewel.
3. If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`: It prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. This logic seems flawed and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

### Flaws in the Program:
- The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is not sufficient to determine if Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
- The program does not handle cases where `k` is significantly larger than `n` or vice versa.
- The program does not utilize the full potential of setting up to 60 stalls with varying prices to achieve the exact number of jewels `k`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, Bob should:
- Use binary search or a greedy strategy to determine the prices of the stalls.
- Ensure the sum of the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall equals `k`.
- Make use of the constraint that he can set up at most 60 stalls.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program is **incorrect** because it fails to cover all possible scenarios and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels in all cases.

**Correctness: False**
