Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Specifically, the logic for determining the number of stalls and their respective prices is insufficient to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels under all conditions.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Handling Large Values of `k`:** The program only considers setting up at most 2 stalls in some cases, which is not sufficient to handle large values of `k` (up to \(10^{18}\)).

2. **General Case Handling:** The program does not provide a general solution for setting up the stalls with appropriate prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels when `k` is large.

3. **Binary Representation Insight:** The problem can be solved by leveraging the binary representation of `k`. For example, if `k` is 8, you can set up 3 stalls with prices 1, 2, and 4, and Alice will buy 1 jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels. However, the program does not implement this approach.

Here is a corrected version of the program that uses the binary representation of `k` to determine the prices of the stalls:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Convert k to binary to determine the number of stalls needed
    stalls = []
    remaining_k = k
    power_of_two = 1
    
    while remaining_k > 0:
        if remaining_k % 2 == 1:
            stalls.append(power_of_two)
        remaining_k //= 2
        power_of_two *= 2
    
    # Check if we can afford the stalls with the given n
    if sum(stalls) <= n:
        print('YES')
        print(len(stalls))
        print(' '.join(map(str, stalls)))
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of stalls is minimized (at most 60, since \(2^{60}\) is a very large number), and the prices are chosen such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
