Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, with \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- Additionally, it is specified that `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- The current value of `n` is explicitly stated to be equal to `k`.

The `print(n)` statement will output the current value of `n`. Since it is given that `n` is equal to `k`, the output will be the value of `k`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is the value of `k`.

Output: **k (where k is the integer read from the input and n is equal to k)**
