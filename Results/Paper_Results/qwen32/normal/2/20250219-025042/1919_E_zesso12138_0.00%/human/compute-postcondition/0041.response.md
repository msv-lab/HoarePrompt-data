Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1); `p` is a list of integers of length `n`; `dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` with at least one element greater than 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` with all elements set to 0 except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `new_dp[j - 1]` which is `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is 2. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `new_dp[2 * n + 1]` is `dp[2 * n] % MOD`; otherwise, no changes are made to `new_dp`. `j` remains `2 * n`.**
