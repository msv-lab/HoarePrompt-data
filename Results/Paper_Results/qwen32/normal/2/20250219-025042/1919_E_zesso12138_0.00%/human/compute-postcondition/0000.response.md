The provided code snippet only reads input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`. This operation does not affect the existing variables `n` and `p`. It assigns the entire input content to a new variable named `input`, which was not previously defined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, and `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, where `|p_i| <= n` for each element `p_i` in `p`; `input` contains the entire input content read from standard input.**
