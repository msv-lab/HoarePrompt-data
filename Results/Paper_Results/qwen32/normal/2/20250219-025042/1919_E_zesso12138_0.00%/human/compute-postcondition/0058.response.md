The code snippet updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. This means the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` changes, while all other variables retain their previous values.

Given that `new_dp[j + 1]` was initially 0, its new value will be `(0 + dp[j]) % MOD`, which simplifies to `dp[j] % MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1), `p` is a list of integers of length `n`, `dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` where each element reflects the cumulative updates from `new_dp` based on the loop logic, `offset` is `n`, `new_dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` where `new_dp[j + 1]` is `dp[j] % MOD` and all other elements are 0, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `dp[j]` is greater than 0. Additionally, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.**
