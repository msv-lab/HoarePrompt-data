Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (at least 1); `p` is a list of integers of length `n`; `dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1`; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of integers of length `2 * n + 1` where `new_dp[0]` is `(new_dp[0] + dp[1]) % MOD` and `new_dp[2]` is `(new_dp[2] + dp[1]) % MOD` if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`; `i` is 3; `j` is 1. If `j - 1 >= 0`, `new_dp[0]` is updated to `(new_dp[0] + dp[1]) % MOD`.**
