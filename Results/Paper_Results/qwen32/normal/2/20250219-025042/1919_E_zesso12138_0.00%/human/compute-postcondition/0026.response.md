The given code snippet appends the current value of `result` to the `results` list. This means that `results` will now contain three elements instead of two, with the third element being the current value of `result`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2*n]`; `p` is a list of integers from `data[4 + 2*n]` to `data[4 + 3*n - 1]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is `4 + 3*n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0 and one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing three elements, the first two of which are the value of `result` (from the previous iteration), and the third element is the updated value of `result` (from the current iteration).**

In simpler terms, `results` now has three elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, with the last one being the most recent. All other variables remain unchanged.
