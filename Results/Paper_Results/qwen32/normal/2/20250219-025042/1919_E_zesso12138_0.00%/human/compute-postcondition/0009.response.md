The code snippet updates the list `p` by mapping the elements from `data` starting at index `index` (which is 2) up to `index + n` to integers. This means `p` will now contain the next `n` integers from the `data` list starting at position 2.

Given that `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, the list `p` will be updated to contain the integers from `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace, `index` is 2, `t` is an integer value greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**
