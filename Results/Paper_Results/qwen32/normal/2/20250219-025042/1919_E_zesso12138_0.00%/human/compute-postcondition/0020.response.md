The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common placeholder for a loop variable when its value is not used), and `t` (the number of iterations). Since `_` does not influence the continuation of the loop, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer value greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, before the next iteration starts, `t` should be one more than its current value.

Let's assume `t` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute again, `t` should be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0 and one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `result`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**

Since we don't know the exact value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0 and one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `result`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**

However, if we need to specify the state more precisely, we can denote the value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration as `t_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t_end + 1`.

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is `t_end + 1` where `t_end` is the value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `result`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**

Given the problem constraints, the most precise answer would be:

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the `input` content by whitespace; `index` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0 and one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `result`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**
