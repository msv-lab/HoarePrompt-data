The code reads `n` lines of input, where each line contains `m` integers representing the depth in each cell of a row in the grid. This updates the `rows` variable to be a 2D list containing these depths.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input, representing the number of rows, number of columns, number of bridges, and maximum distance between supports respectively; `rows` is a 2D list where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains `m` integers representing the depth in each cell, as read from the input.**
