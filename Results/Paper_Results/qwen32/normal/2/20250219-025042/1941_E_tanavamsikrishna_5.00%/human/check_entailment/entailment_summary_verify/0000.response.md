### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions in detail to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid where each bridge spans over a row with supports placed such that:
1. There is a support at the first and last column.
2. The distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
3. The cost of placing a support at `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

The goal is to minimize the total cost of placing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

#### Analysis of Provided Code:

**Function `func_1`:**
```python
def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
    return row[-1]
```
This function attempts to compute the cost of placing supports on a single row. However, the logic seems flawed:
- It adds 1 to the first `d-1` elements, which is not necessarily correct.
- It then calculates the cost for the rest of the row based on the minimum value in a sliding window of size `d+1`, which does not guarantee that the supports are placed optimally according to the problem constraints.

**Function `func_2`:**
```python
def func_2():
    (n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
    print(min(total_costs))
```
This function reads the input, computes the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows. Since `func_1` is incorrect, the results from `func_2` will also be incorrect.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Support Placement Logic:** The logic in `func_1` does not correctly place supports such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:** The cost calculation in `func_1` is flawed, leading to incorrect results in `func_2`.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the code, it is clear that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
