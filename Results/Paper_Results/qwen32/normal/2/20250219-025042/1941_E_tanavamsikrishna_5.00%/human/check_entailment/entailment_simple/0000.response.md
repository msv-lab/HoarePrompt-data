### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand whether it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- **Objective**: Minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges across a river grid.
- **Constraints**:
  - Each bridge spans one row.
  - Supports must be installed at the start (`(i,1)`) and end (`(i,m)`) of each row.
  - The distance between any two adjacent supports cannot exceed `d`.
  - The cost of installing a support at `(i,j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
- **Approach**:
  - For each row, calculate the minimum cost to install supports such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
  - Sum the costs for `k` consecutive rows and find the minimum sum.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports for a single row.
   - It initializes the first `d-1` elements of the row with their respective costs plus 1.
   - For each subsequent element, it calculates the cost as the minimum cost of the previous `d` elements plus the current cell's depth plus 1.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last element in the row, which represents the minimum cost to install supports for that row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input parameters and the grid.
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to get the minimum cost for installing supports in that row.
   - It then calculates the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It prints the minimum sum among these sets.

#### Issues in the Code:
- **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`**:
  - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly handle the requirement that supports must be installed at the start and end of each row.
  - The function should ensure that the first and last elements are always included in the support installation, and the calculation of the minimum cost should respect this constraint.
  - The current implementation does not guarantee that the first and last elements are part of the optimal solution.

- **Potential Optimization Issue**:
  - The current approach recalculates the cost for each row independently and then sums the costs for `k` consecutive rows.
  - While this works, it might not be the most efficient way to handle large inputs due to the nested loops and repeated calculations.

Given the issues identified in the `func_1` function, the code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
