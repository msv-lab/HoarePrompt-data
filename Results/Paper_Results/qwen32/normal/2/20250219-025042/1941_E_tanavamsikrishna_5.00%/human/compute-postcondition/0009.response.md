The code appends the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k` (exclusive) of the `costs` list to the `total_costs` list. Given that `i` is 2, the sum of `costs[2]` to `costs[2 + k]` (which is `costs[2]` to `costs[k + 1]`) is calculated and appended to `total_costs`.

Therefore, the new `total_costs` list will include the previously existing sums plus the newly calculated sum.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `k`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers; `rows` is a 2D list with at least `k` sublists, each containing `m` integers; `costs` is a list containing the results of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows` and has at least `k` elements; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, the sum of `costs[1]` to `costs[k]`, and the sum of `costs[2]` to `costs[k + 1]`; `i` is 2.**
