The code appends the sum of the next `k` elements in the `costs` list (from index `i` to `i + k - 1`) to the `total_costs` list. Given that `i` is initially 1, the new element added to `total_costs` will be the sum of `costs[1]` to `costs[k]`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least `k`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers; `rows` is a 2D list with at least `k` sublists, each containing `m` integers; `costs` is a list containing the results of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows` and has at least `k` elements; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of `costs[1]` to `costs[k]`; `i` is 1.**
