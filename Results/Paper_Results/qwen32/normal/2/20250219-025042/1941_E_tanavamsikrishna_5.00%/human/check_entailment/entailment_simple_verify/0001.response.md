### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
- Each bridge spans from the first column to the last column.
- Supports must be installed at the first and last columns, and the cost of installing a support at `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`.
- The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
- We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

#### Analysis of the Code:

##### Function `func_1`:
- This function is intended to compute the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
- The first loop increments the cost for the first `d-1` columns by 1.
- The second loop updates the cost for each subsequent column by adding the cost of the current cell plus 1 and the minimum cost of placing a support within the previous `d` columns.
- The function returns the cost of the last column, which is supposed to represent the total cost of building a bridge on that row.

However, there are significant issues with this approach:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The function does not ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. It simply considers the minimum cost within the previous `d` columns without ensuring that supports are placed such that the distance constraint is satisfied.
   - The logic for calculating the cost for each column does not account for the requirement that supports must be placed at the first and last columns and that the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

##### Function `func_2`:
- This function handles multiple test cases.
- It reads the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
- It reads the grid of depths.
- It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
- It then iterates over all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows, sums their costs, and keeps track of the minimum total cost.
- Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

Given the issues in `func_1`, the overall approach in `func_2` is flawed because it relies on incorrect cost calculations for individual rows.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, a dynamic programming approach is needed:
1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to place a support at column `j` in row `i`.
2. **Initialization**: Initialize the first and last columns with their respective costs plus 1.
3. **Transition**: For each cell `(i, j)`, compute the minimum cost by considering the minimum cost of placing a support within the previous `d` columns and adding the current cell's cost plus one.
4. **Result Calculation**: For each row, compute the total cost of placing supports and use these values to find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem due to the incorrect cost calculation in `func_1`. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues.

**Final:** **False**
