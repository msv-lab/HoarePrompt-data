You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of rows in the grid, m is an integer representing the number of columns in the grid, k is an integer representing the number of bridges, and d is an integer representing the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains m integers representing the depth in each cell.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of all contiguous sub-lists of length `k` from the `costs` list.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the smallest sum of any contiguous sub-list of length k from the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four integer parameters: `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of columns), `k` (number of bridges), and `d` (maximum distance between supports). It also accepts a 2D list `rows` where each sublist represents a row in the grid and contains `m` integers representing the depth in each cell. The function evaluates these parameters to determine if it's possible to build the specified number of bridges within the given constraints and returns a result indicating whether the construction is feasible or not.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
