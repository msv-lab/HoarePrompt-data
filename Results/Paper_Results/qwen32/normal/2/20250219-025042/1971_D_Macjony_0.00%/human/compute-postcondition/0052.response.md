Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 500; `s` is a string with length greater than or equal to 3; `count` is either 2 or 3; `flag` is True if the character at index `j` of `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is 3 if `flag` is True, otherwise `j` is 2; `i` is `len(s)`**
