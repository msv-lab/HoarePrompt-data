Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). For each test case, the function processes the list `a` and returns a result based on the specified criteria.**
