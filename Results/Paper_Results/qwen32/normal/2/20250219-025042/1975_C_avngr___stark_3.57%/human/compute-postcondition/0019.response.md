The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means that the previous value of `a` is overwritten.

Given the initial state, `t` is decremented by 1 from the previous state, `n` is an input integer, and `max` is the maximum value among all the minimums of consecutive pairs in the list `a`.

Since the new value of `a` is derived from the input, the previous value of `a` is no longer relevant. The values of `t`, `n`, and `max` remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified in the code snippet, which they are not.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1 from the previous state, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `max` is the maximum value among all the minimums of consecutive pairs in the previous list `a`.**

However, since `a` has been reassigned, `max` should now be recalculated based on the new list `a`. But as per the given instruction, we only update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code. Thus, `max` is not recalculated here.

So the final Output State considering only the changes made by the code is:

Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1 from the previous state, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.**
