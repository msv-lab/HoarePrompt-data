To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- The loop runs as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented again by 1 from its current value.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` does not change during the loop iterations; it remains constant.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `t`, `a`, and `max` are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

Given that `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration (as per the logic of incrementing `i` by 1 each time), at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 4**.
