Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. Each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, followed by a list of `n` integers `a` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to the value of the first input integer, which represents the number of test cases. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged as they have not been modified by the given code snippet.
