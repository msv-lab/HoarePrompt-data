To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is incremented by `n-2`
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is 2
- If the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`

Since `i` is currently 2, and the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, the next value for `i` should be 3 (assuming `n` is at least 3).

Here's how we adjust the state:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration, so `i` becomes 3.
- `n` remains the same as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Other variables (`t`, `a`, `max`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is incremented by `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 3**
