Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n`, representing the difficulty levels of the problems.

2. **Counting Difficulty Levels:**
   - A `defaultdict` named `d` is used to count occurrences of each difficulty level.
   - The dictionary is initialized with keys 'A' through 'G', all set to 0.
   - The program iterates over the string `s` and increments the count for each difficulty level found.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. This will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - The program iterates over the keys in the dictionary `d`. For each key (difficulty level):
     - If the count of that difficulty level (`d[val]`) is less than or equal to `m`, it adds `m - d[val]` to `ans`.
     - This logic assumes that if there are fewer problems of a certain difficulty level than the number of rounds (`m`), Vlad needs to create enough additional problems to meet the requirement.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all difficulty levels for a test case, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of additional problems needed for that test case.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Logic for Counting Additional Problems:**
  - The current logic incorrectly adds `m - d[val]` to `ans` for every difficulty level where `d[val]` is less than or equal to `m`. This is flawed because:
    - If `d[val]` is greater than `m`, no additional problems are needed for that difficulty level.
    - However, if `d[val]` is less than `m`, the program only needs to add enough problems to reach `m` for each difficulty level, but it does not account for the fact that some difficulty levels might already have sufficient problems.
    - The correct approach would be to check if the total number of problems across all difficulty levels is at least `7 * m` (since each round requires one problem of each of the 7 difficulty levels). If not, calculate the shortfall.

- **Redundant Function:**
  - The function `func_1()` is defined but never used. This does not affect the correctness of the program but is unnecessary.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
