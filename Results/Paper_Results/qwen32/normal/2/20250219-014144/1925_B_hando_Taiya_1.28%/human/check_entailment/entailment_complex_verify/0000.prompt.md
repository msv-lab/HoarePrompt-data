You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, and for each test case, x and n are integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁸ and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: the largest valid divisor or quotient `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the conditions `n <= x // i` or `n > x // i` and `n <= i`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest valid divisor or quotient i or x // i that satisfies n <= i and either n <= x // i or n > x // i)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it determines the largest divisor or quotient of `x` that satisfies the condition `n` is less than or equal to the divisor or quotient. The result for each test case is printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Program Analysis

The program aims to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a problemset of `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.

Here's the provided program:

```python
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Loop through divisors**: The program iterates through divisors of `x` up to the integer square root of `x`.
2. **Check conditions**: For each divisor `i`, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If either condition is true, it updates the maximum balance (`ans`) with the maximum of the current `ans` and `i` or `x // i`.

### Potential Issues

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program needs to handle edge cases where `x` is very small or `n` is equal to `x`.
2. **Optimality**: The program should ensure that the chosen divisors can form a valid set of `n` sub-problems whose sum equals `x`.

### Testing with Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Example 1

**Input:**
```
3
10 3
5 5
420 69
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1
6
```

**Program Output:**
```
2
1
6
```

The program seems to produce the correct output for these examples.

#### Additional Test Cases

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Only one sub-problem with difficulty `1`.
   
2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `10 1`
   - Expected Output: `10`
   - Explanation: Only one sub-problem with difficulty `10`.
   
3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `12 3`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Sub-problems with difficulties `3, 3, 6` or `4, 4, 4`.

Let's check the program against these additional test cases.

#### Test Case 1

**Input:**
```
1
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Program Output:**
```
1
```

#### Test Case 2

**Input:**
```
1
10 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
10
```

**Program Output:**
```
10
```

#### Test Case 3

**Input:**
```
1
12 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Program Output:**
```
3
```
