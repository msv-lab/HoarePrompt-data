Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10⁸, `i` is 5. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 5 if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`; `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i` if `n` is greater than `x // i` but less than or equal to `i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `ans` remains unchanged.**
