Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to split an integer `x` into `n` positive integer parts such that the GCD of these parts is maximized.

### Key Observations:
1. **Divisors and GCD**: If we consider a divisor `d` of `x`, then we can potentially split `x` into `n` parts where each part is a multiple of `d`. The GCD of these parts will be at least `d`.
2. **Feasibility of Splitting**: To split `x` into `n` parts where each part is a multiple of `d`, the sum of these parts must be `x`. This means `x / d` should be at least `n` because each part must be at least `d`.
3. **Maximizing GCD**: We need to find the largest `d` such that `x / d >= n` or `d >= x / n`.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code iterates over all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` and checks if the divisor or its corresponding quotient can be used to form `n` parts. It keeps track of the maximum such divisor.

#### Steps in the Code:
1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
2. **Finding Divisors**: For each test case, it iterates from `1` to the square root of `x` to find divisors.
3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If `i` is a divisor of `x` (`x % i == 0`), it checks if `n <= x // i` (which means we can split `x` into `n` parts each being at least `i`).
   - Alternatively, it checks if `n <= i` (which means we can split `x` into `n` parts each being at least `x // i`).
4. **Updating Maximum GCD**: It updates the maximum GCD found so far.
5. **Printing Result**: After processing all divisors, it prints the maximum GCD.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Divisor Check**: The code correctly checks all possible divisors of `x` up to its square root.
- **Feasibility Condition**: The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that the splitting is feasible.
- **Maximum GCD Update**: The code keeps track of the maximum feasible divisor, which is indeed the maximum possible GCD.

### Conclusion:
The logic and implementation of the code are correct based on the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
