You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, and for each test case, x and n are integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁸ and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: the largest valid divisor or quotient `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the conditions `n <= x // i` or `n > x // i` and `n <= i`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest valid divisor or quotient i or x // i that satisfies n <= i and either n <= x // i or n > x // i)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. For each test case, it determines the largest divisor or quotient of `x` that satisfies the condition `n` is less than or equal to the divisor or quotient. The result for each test case is printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to divide a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`, and we want to maximize the GCD of these sub-problems' difficulties.

### Key Observations
1. The GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems will be maximized if we can find a divisor `d` of `x` such that `x/d` is at least `n`. This is because if `x` can be divided into `n` parts where each part has a difficulty of `d`, then the GCD is `d`.
2. If `x/d < n`, we need to consider the other divisor `x/i` where `i` is a divisor of `x` and `i <= n`.

### Program Analysis
The program iterates through all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` (inclusive). For each divisor `i`:
- It checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x/i`. If true, it updates the answer to the maximum of the current answer and `i`.
- It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If true, it updates the answer to the maximum of the current answer and `x/i`.

This approach ensures that we consider both `i` and `x/i` as potential GCD values, which is correct because both could potentially be the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement:

1. **Test Case 1**: `x = 10`, `n = 3`
   - Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
   - For `i = 1`: `x/i = 10`, `n <= 10` → `ans = max(0, 1) = 1`
   - For `i = 2`: `x/i = 5`, `n <= 5` → `ans = max(1, 2) = 2`
   - For `i = 5`: `x/i = 2`, `n > 2` → Skip
   - For `i = 10`: `x/i = 1`, `n > 1` → Skip
   - Final `ans = 2`

2. **Test Case 2**: `x = 5`, `n = 5`
   - Divisors of 5: 1, 5

   - Final `ans = 1`

3. **Test Case 3**: `x = 420`, `n = 69`
   - Divisors of 420: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420

   - For `i = 14`: `x/i = 30`, `n <= 30` → `ans = max(6, 14) = 14` (but 14 does not satisfy `n <= 69` condition)
   - For `i = 15`: `x/i = 28`, `n <= 28` → `ans = max(6, 15) = 15` (but 15 does not satisfy `n <= 69` condition)
   - For `i = 20`: `x/i = 21`, `n <= 21` → `ans = max(6, 20) = 20` (but 20 does not satisfy `n <= 69` condition)
   - For `i = 21`: `x/i = 20`, `n <= 20` → `ans = max(6, 21) = 21` (but 21 does not satisfy `n <= 69` condition)
   - For `i = 28`: `x/i = 15`, `n <= 15` → `ans = max(6, 28) = 28` (but 28 does not satisfy `n <= 69` condition)
   - For `i = 30`: `x/i = 14`, `n <= 14` → `ans = max(6, 30) = 30` (but 30 does not satisfy `n <= 69` condition)
   - For `i = 35`: `x/i = 12`, `n <= 12` → `ans = max(6, 35) = 35` (but 35 does not satisfy `n <= 69` condition)
   - For `i = 42`: `x/i = 10`, `n <= 10` → `ans = max(6, 42) = 42` (but 42 does not satisfy `n <= 69` condition)
   - For `i = 60`: `x/i = 7`, `n <= 7` → `ans = max(6, 60) = 60` (but 60 does not satisfy `n <= 69` condition)
   - For `i = 70`: `x/i = 6`, `n <= 6` → `ans = max(6, 70) = 70` (but 70 does not satisfy `n <= 69` condition)
   - For `i = 69`: `x/i = 6`, `n <= 69` → `ans = max(6, 6) = 6`
   - Final `ans = 6`
