The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints given, it likely processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers, `x` and `n`. The function is expected to handle `t` test cases, with each test case defined by the integers `x` and `n`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (indicating the number of test cases).
- For each test case, `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁸ and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.

The function's output is not fully specified in terms of exact return values for different conditions of `x` and `n`, but we can infer that it performs some computation or evaluation based on these inputs.

Since the exact computation or condition leading to specific outputs is not detailed, we can describe the functionality in a general sense:

Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`. It performs some computation or evaluation based on these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
