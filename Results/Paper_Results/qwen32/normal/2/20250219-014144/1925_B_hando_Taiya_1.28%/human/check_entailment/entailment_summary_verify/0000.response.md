To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary. We will also verify the program's behavior against several test cases.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective**: Find the maximum balance (GCD) of a problemset of `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
- **Constraints**: `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3` (number of test cases), `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8` (difficulty of the main problem), `1 ≤ n ≤ x` (number of sub-problems).

### Program Code Recap
```python
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```

### Function Summary Recap
- The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`.
- For each test case, it determines the largest divisor or quotient of `x` that satisfies the condition `n` is less than or equal to the divisor or quotient.
- The result for each test case is printed.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Key Points to Consider
1. **Iterating through Divisors**: The loop iterates from `1` to the integer square root of `x` to find divisors of `x`.
2. **Checking Conditions**: For each divisor `i`, it checks:
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` with the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` with the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.

#### Correctness Evaluation
1. **Divisor Check**: The program correctly identifies divisors of `x` and their corresponding quotients.
2. **Condition Checks**:
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it means we can split `x` into `n` parts where each part has at least `i` difficulty.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it means we can split `x` into `n` parts where each part has at least `x // i` difficulty.
3. **Max Balance Calculation**: The program keeps track of the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the above conditions, ensuring the maximum possible GCD.
