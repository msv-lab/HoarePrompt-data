### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program against the problem requirements.

1. **Case 1: \( n < k \)**
   - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels she needs to buy, it is impossible for her to buy \( k \) jewels. The program correctly outputs 'NO' in this case.

2. **Case 2: \( n = k \)**
   - If Alice has exactly as many coins as the number of jewels she needs to buy, Bob can set up one stall with the price equal to \( n \) (or \( k \)), and Alice will buy exactly one jewel. The program correctly outputs 'YES', followed by `1` and `n`.

3. **Case 3: \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \)**
   - This condition is more complex. Let's break it down:
     - \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \) simplifies to \( 2k - 2 < n \) or \( k < \frac{n}{2} + 1 \).
     - If this condition holds, the program sets up two stalls with prices \( n - k + 1 \) and `1`.
     - Alice will first buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall. Since the price per jewel is \( n - k + 1 \), she can buy at most one jewel from this stall, leaving her with \( n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1 \) coins.
     - Then, she will buy \( k - 1 \) jewels from the second stall, since the price per jewel is `1`.
     - In total, Alice will buy \( 1 + (k - 1) = k \) jewels.
     - However, this logic is flawed because it assumes that \( n - k + 1 \) is a valid price (i.e., it should be less than or equal to \( n \)). Also, it doesn't consider the possibility of setting up more than two stalls to achieve the exact number of jewels \( k \).

4. **All Other Cases**
   - The program outputs 'NO' for all other cases, which includes when \( n > k \) but the condition \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \) does not hold. This is not necessarily correct because there might be other ways to set up the stalls to make Alice buy exactly \( k \) jewels.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to cover all scenarios correctly, especially when \( n > k \). It does not provide a general solution for setting up stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
