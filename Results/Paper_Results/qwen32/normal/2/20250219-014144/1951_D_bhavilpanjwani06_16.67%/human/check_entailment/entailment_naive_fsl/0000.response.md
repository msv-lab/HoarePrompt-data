Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only considers three scenarios:

1. When `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.
2. When `n == k`, it prints "YES" and sets up one stall with the price equal to `n` because Alice can buy exactly one jewel with all her coins.
3. When `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. This scenario is too simplistic and does not cover the general case where `k` can be much larger and requires more stalls to achieve the exact number of jewels bought.

However, the problem statement requires Bob to set up at most 60 stalls and set prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The provided solution does not guarantee this for all values of `n` and `k`.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
255 8
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
8
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
```

The provided program would not produce the correct output for this case because it does not handle the general scenario of setting up multiple stalls with varying prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description.
