Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each of the remaining \(t-1\) test cases, there are two positive integers \(n\) and \(k\) such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- Additionally, \(n\) is greater than or equal to \(k\).
- In the current test case, \(n\) is equal to \(k\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n)
```

### Analysis:
From the initial state, we know that for the current test case, \(n\) is explicitly stated to be equal to \(k\). However, the specific values of \(n\) and \(k\) are not provided. We only know that they are equal and within the range \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).

Since the code snippet simply prints the value of \(n\), and we know \(n = k\), the output will be the value of \(n\) (which is also the value of \(k\)) for the current test case.

### Output:
Given the constraints and the information provided, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **n (where n is equal to k for the current test case)**
