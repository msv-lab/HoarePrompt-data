The initial state describes a scenario involving multiple test cases, where for each test case (except the first one), there are two positive integers `n` and `k` with the condition that `n` is less than `k`. However, the provided Python code snippet is simply:

```python
print('NO')
```

This print statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `k`. It directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`, the output of the print statement will always be `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
