Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each of the remaining \(t-1\) test cases, there are two positive integers \(n\) and \(k\) such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- It is also specified that \(n \geq k\) and \(n \neq k\).
- Additionally, \(k - 1 \geq n - k + 1\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet simply outputs the string `'NO'`. This output does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `k`. The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` because the string `'NO'` is directly specified.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
