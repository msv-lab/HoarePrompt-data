To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. This indicates the number of test cases.
2. For each of the remaining `t-1` test cases, there are two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}.
3. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`.
4. In the current test case, it is specified that `k - 1 < n - k + 1`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the expression `n - k + 1`:

- Since `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, we can rearrange this inequality to `2k - 1 < n`, which implies `n > 2k - 1`.
- Given that `n` and `k` are positive integers and `n >= k`, the expression `n - k + 1` represents a positive integer because `n` is always greater than or equal to `k`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

This means the code will print two values separated by a space:
1. The value of `n - k + 1`, which is a positive integer greater than 1 based on the given conditions.
2. The integer `1`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `n - k + 1`. However, we know the structure of the output.

Therefore, the output can be described as:
Output: **n - k + 1, 1 (where n - k + 1 is a positive integer greater than 1 based on the given conditions)**
