The given initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` but does not specify their exact values. However, it does provide constraints and conditions that these variables must satisfy. The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the specific values of `t`, `n`, or `k`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- For each of the remaining `t-1` test cases, there are two positive integers `n` and `k` where `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}`.
- It is also specified that `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`.
- Additionally, in the current test case, `k - 1 < n - k + 1`.

Despite these constraints and conditions, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
