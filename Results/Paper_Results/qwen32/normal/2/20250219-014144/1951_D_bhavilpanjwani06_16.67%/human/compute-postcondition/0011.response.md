Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each of the remaining \(t-1\) test cases, there are two positive integers \(n\) and \(k\) such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- Additionally, \(n \geq k\) and \(n \neq k\).
- In the current test case, \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet simply outputs the integer `2`. The value `2` is explicitly stated in the code and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state. Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`, the output will always be `2`.

### Output:
Output: **2**
