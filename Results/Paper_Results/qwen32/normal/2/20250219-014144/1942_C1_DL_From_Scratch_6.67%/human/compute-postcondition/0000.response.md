Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `T` now holds the integer value read from the input. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
