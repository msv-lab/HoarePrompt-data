Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    list0 = sorted(list0)
    count = 0
    for i in range(x - 1):
        num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
    num = n - list0[-1]
    if num == 1:
        count += 1
    print(count + x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input; `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `count` is the number of times `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1` equals 1 for `i` ranging from 0 to `x - 2`, and `count` has been incremented by 1 if `num` was 1; `num` is `n - list0[-1]`. If `num` is 1, `count` has been incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is `T - 1`; `n`, `x`, and `y` are new integers read from the input; `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `num` is `n - list0[-1]`. If `num` equals 1, `count` is the total number of times `num` was equal to 1 during all iterations, including this one, and `count` has been incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. `i` is `x - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 1, `n` and `y` are integers read from the input, `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is `x - 1`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`. If `num` equals 1, then `count` is the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `list0` was exactly 2, plus 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
