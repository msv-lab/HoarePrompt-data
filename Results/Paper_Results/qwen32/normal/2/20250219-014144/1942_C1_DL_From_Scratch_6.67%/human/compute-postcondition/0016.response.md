Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input where `x` is greater than 1; `list0` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` remains the same; `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `num` is calculated as the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in the sorted list `list0`, minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
