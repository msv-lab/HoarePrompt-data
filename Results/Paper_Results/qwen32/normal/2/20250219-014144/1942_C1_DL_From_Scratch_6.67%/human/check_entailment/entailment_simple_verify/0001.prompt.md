You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a regular polygon with `n` sides. Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices, and we need to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using these vertices. Since `y = 0`, we cannot choose any additional vertices.

### Key Observations

1. **Vertices and Triangles**: To form a triangle, we need at least 3 vertices. Given `x` vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed without additional vertices is limited by the number of ways we can choose 3 vertices out of `x`.

2. **Non-Intersecting Diagonals**: The problem specifies that the diagonals must be non-intersecting. This means that once a diagonal is drawn, it should not intersect with any other diagonal.

3. **Maximizing Triangles**: To maximize the number of triangles, we need to ensure that the vertices are distributed in such a way that they allow the formation of the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of adjacent vertices and calculating the potential triangles based on them.

#### Steps in the Provided Code

1. **Input Reading**: The code reads the number of test cases `T`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` followed by the list of `x` vertices.
2. **Sorting**: The list of vertices is sorted.
3. **Counting Adjacent Vertices**: The code iterates through the sorted list of vertices and counts the number of times two consecutive vertices are adjacent (i.e., the difference between them is 1).
4. **Handling Wrap-Around**: It also checks if the last vertex is adjacent to the first vertex (considering the wrap-around in the polygon).
5. **Calculating Triangles**: The number of triangles is calculated based on the count of adjacent vertices and the formula `count + x - 2`.

### Issues in the Provided Code

1. **Incorrect Triangle Counting**: The logic for counting triangles is flawed. Simply counting adjacent vertices and using the formula `count + x - 2` does not correctly account for the formation of non-intersecting triangles.
2. **Lack of Proper Triangle Formation Logic**: The code does not properly implement the logic required to form non-intersecting triangles using the given vertices.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the provided code, it is clear that the solution does not correctly determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
