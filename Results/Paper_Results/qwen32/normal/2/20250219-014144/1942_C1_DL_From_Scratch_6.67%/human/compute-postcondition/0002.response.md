The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state does not specify any values for `n`, `x`, or `y`, so these values are determined by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, and `T` remains greater than 0. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are now assigned the integer values provided by the input.
