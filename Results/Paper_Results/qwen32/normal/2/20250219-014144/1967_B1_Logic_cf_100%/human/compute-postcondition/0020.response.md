Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is incremented by 1, `ans` is recalculated as `n + (n + b) // (b * b) + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is incremented by 1**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its previous value. All other conditions and values remain the same, except that `b` and `T` have each been incremented by 1.
