Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. If `n` and `m` meet certain conditions, it returns a specific output; otherwise, it returns a different output. The exact conditions and outputs are not specified, but the function handles up to 10,000 test cases with constraints on the values of `n` and `m` to ensure efficient processing.**
