### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided program using the annotations and the original assessment.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Mathematical Insight:
From the mathematical insight in the original assessment, we deduced that for each \(b\), \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\) up to \(n\). Therefore, the number of valid pairs for each \(b\) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program initializes `ans` with `n`, which correctly counts the pairs where \(b = 1\) because for \(b = 1\), every \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) is valid. Then, for each \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`. 

Let's analyze the term \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor\):

- When \(b = 1\), \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{1^2} \right\rfloor = n + 1\), but we already counted \(n\) pairs for \(b = 1\), so adding \(n + 1\) would be incorrect.
- For \(b > 1\), \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor\) does not directly give the number of multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\). Instead, it seems to be an incorrect formula for counting the valid pairs.

The correct formula should be \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\) for each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm the program's steps but do not validate the correctness of the formula used. They merely describe the state of the program at key points without challenging the logic behind the formula.

#### Conclusion:
Given the mathematical insight and the analysis of the provided program, the formula used in the program is incorrect. The program does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
