Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not properly checked in the loop. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that `(n + b) // (b * b)` will give the correct count of valid `a` values for each `b`, which is not the case.

Here's a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect and how it could be fixed:

1. For each pair `(a, b)`, we need to check if `a + b` is divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`.
2. The current implementation only considers the divisor `b * b` and does not compute the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) between `a` and `b`.

To fix this, you would need to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` within their respective ranges and check the condition using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

However, this naive approach might be too slow due to the constraints (up to 10^6 for `n` and `m`). A more efficient solution would be required to handle the upper limits of the input size.
