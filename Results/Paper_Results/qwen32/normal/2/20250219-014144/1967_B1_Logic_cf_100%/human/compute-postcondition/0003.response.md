The code converts the strings `n` and `m` into integers. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and `n` and `m` are strings representing numbers. After executing the code, `n` and `m` are now integers instead of strings.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is an integer; `m` is an integer.**
