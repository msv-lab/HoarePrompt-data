Let's analyze the given program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

### Issues Identified:
1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This seems to assume that for each test case, there are initially `n` valid pairs, which is not necessarily true based on the problem description.
2. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates from `b = 2` to `min(n, m)`. This misses the case where `b = 1`, which should also be considered.
3. **Condition Check**: The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not directly checked in the loop. Instead, the program uses `(n + b) // (b * b)`, which does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

### Potential Counterexample:
Let's consider a simple test case to check if the program works correctly:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `1` (only pair is (1, 1))
- Program Output: `1` (correct for this specific case)

However, let's try another test case:
- Input: `2 2`
- Expected Output: `3` (pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2))
- Program Output: `2` (incorrect)

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly account for all valid pairs. Specifically, it misses pairs where `b = 1` and does not properly check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases correctly, particularly missing the case where `b = 1` and not properly checking the condition for other values of `b`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.
