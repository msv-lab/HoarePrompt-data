The code reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n` and `m`. Since `input().split()` returns a list of strings, `n` and `m` will be strings representing the two input numbers.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is a string representing the first input number; `m` is a string representing the second input number.**
