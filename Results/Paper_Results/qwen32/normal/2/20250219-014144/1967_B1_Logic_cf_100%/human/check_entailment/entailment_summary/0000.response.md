### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, initializes `ans` to `n`, and then iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)` inclusive. In each iteration, it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.

However, the logic in the program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Here's why:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which corresponds to counting all pairs where \(b = 1\). This part is correct because when \(b = 1\), \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\), and the condition simplifies to checking if \(a + 1\) is a multiple of \(b\), which is always true since \(b = 1\).

2. **Iteration Over `b`**: The program iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. However, the formula used inside the loop, \((n + b) // (b * b)\), does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each `b`. The correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of `a` for each `b` and checking if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds.

3. **Condition Check**: The program does not perform any explicit check to see if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\). Instead, it uses a simplified formula that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

#### Conclusion:
The program's logic does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements. It uses an incorrect formula to compute the number of valid pairs, leading to incorrect results for most test cases.
