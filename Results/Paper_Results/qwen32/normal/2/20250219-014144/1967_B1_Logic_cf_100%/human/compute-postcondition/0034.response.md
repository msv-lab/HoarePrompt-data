The given code modifies the value of `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `T`, and `b`) remain unchanged except for `ans`. 

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` remain integers such that `min(n, m) >= 2`.
- `T` remains incremented by 1.
- `b` remains `b + 1` and `b + 1 <= min(n, m)`.
- `ans` is now `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) >= 2`, `ans` is `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is incremented by 1, `b` is `b + 1` and `b + 1 <= min(n, m)`**.
