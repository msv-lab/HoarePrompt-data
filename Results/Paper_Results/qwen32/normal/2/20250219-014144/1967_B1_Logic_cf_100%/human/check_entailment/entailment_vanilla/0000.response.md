Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Mathematical Insight:
To satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), let's denote \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then we can write \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition becomes:
\[ dx + dy \equiv 0 \pmod{dy^2} \]
\[ d(x + y) \equiv 0 \pmod{dy^2} \]
\[ x + y \equiv 0 \pmod{dy} \]
Since \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, this simplifies to:
\[ x + y \equiv 0 \pmod{y} \]
\[ x \equiv -y \pmod{y} \]
This means \(x\) must be a multiple of \(y\), but since \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the only solution is \(x = 1\). Thus, \(a = d\) and the condition reduces to:
\[ d + b \equiv 0 \pmod{db} \]
\[ d + b \equiv 0 \pmod{db} \]
\[ 1 + \frac{b}{d} \equiv 0 \pmod{b} \]
\[ 1 \equiv -\frac{b}{d} \pmod{b} \]
This implies that \(d\) must divide \(b\). Therefore, for each \(b\), \(a\) can be any multiple of \(b\) up to \(n\).

### Correct Solution Approach:
For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), count how many multiples of \(b\) exist up to \(n\). This is simply \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program does not correctly implement the above logic. Here's what it does:
1. It initializes `ans` with `n`, which counts the pairs where \(b = 1\).
2. For each \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`.

This approach does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) because it incorrectly calculates the number of multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\).

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
