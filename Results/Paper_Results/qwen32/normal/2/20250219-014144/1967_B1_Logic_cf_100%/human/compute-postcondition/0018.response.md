To determine the new state after the given code snippet executes, let's analyze the changes:

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is `n`, `T` is incremented by 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
```

This line modifies the value of `ans`. The new value of `ans` is calculated as its old value plus the integer division of `(n + b)` by `(b * b)`.

Since `b` is not defined in the initial state, we'll keep it as `b` in our output state.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `T`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` remains at least 2, `m` remains at least 2, `ans` is updated to `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, and `T` is incremented by 1.
