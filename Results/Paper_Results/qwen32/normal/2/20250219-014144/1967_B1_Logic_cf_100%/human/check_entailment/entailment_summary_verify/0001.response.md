### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem requirements and the mathematical insight derived from the problem statement.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Mathematical Insight:
From the problem analysis, we concluded that for each \(b\), \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\) up to \(n\). Specifically, the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\) is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:
1. It initializes `ans` with `n`, which counts the pairs where \(b = 1\).
2. For each \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`.

Let's verify if the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor\) correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

For a given \(b\), the number of multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\) is indeed \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\). However, the program uses \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor\), which does not match the required formula.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the discrepancy:
- Suppose \(n = 10\) and \(b = 2\).
  - The correct number of multiples of 2 up to 10 is \(\left\lfloor \frac{10}{2} \right\rfloor = 5\).
  - The program calculates \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 2}{2^2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{12}{4} \right\rfloor = 3\).

Clearly, the program's formula does not yield the correct count of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. The formula used in the program to count valid pairs is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
