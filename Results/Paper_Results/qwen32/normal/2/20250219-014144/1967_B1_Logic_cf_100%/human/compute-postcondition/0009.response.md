To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was incremented by 1.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `b` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, if `b` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it is now `k+1`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `b` must still be within the range `[2, min(n, m)]`. Since `b` was just incremented, it should now be `k+1`, where `k` was the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `b` should be `k+1` (where `k` was the value of `b` at the end of the previous iteration).
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

Since the problem specifies that `b` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, we can infer that `b` should now be `b + 1` from the previous state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) ≥ 2`, `b` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`**

However, to be more precise in terms of the new value of `b`:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) ≥ 2`, `b` is now `b + 1` from the previous iteration, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`**

Given that `b` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `b` should be `b + 1` from that point. Hence, if `b` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it is now `k + 1`.

So the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) ≥ 2`, `b` is `b + 1` from the previous iteration, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`**

But to reflect the exact new value of `b`:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) ≥ 2`, `b` is now `b + 1`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`**

Thus, the correct state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that `min(n, m) ≥ 2`, `b` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**
