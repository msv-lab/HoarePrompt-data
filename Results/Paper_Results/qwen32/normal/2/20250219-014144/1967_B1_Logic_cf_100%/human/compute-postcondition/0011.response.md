To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop operates and how it modifies the variable `ans`. The loop iterates over `b` from 2 up to `min(n, m)`, and during each iteration, it updates `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `m` are integers.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `b` starting from 2 up to `min(n, m)`.
   - In each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop completes, `ans` will have accumulated the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.

Thus, the final output state can be described as:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is updated to its initial value plus the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.

Using the specified format:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers, `ans` is `n + Σ((n + b) // (b * b)) for b from 2 to min(n, m)`**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the variable `ans` will be equal to its initial value `n` plus the sum of the integer division of `(n + b)` by `(b * b)` for all values of `b` ranging from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`.
