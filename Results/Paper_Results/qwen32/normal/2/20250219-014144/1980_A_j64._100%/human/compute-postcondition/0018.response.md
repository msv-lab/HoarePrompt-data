Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5; `a` is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `count` is a list of 7 integers where each element at index `i` represents the frequency of the character `chr(i + ord('A'))` in the string `a`. If `count[6]` is less than `m`, then `needed_problems` is updated to `needed_problems + (m - count[6])`. Otherwise, `needed_problems` remains unchanged. `i` is 6.**
