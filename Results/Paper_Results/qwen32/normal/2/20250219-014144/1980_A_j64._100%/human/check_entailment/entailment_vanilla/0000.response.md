Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step:

### Problem Analysis:
- Vlad needs to organize `m` rounds.
- Each round requires exactly one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
- Vlad has `n` problems with varying difficulty levels.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can conduct all `m` rounds.

### Solution Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It also reads the string `a` which represents the difficulty levels of the existing problems.

2. **Counting Existing Problems**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of size 7 to zero. This list will store the count of problems for each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - It iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the difficulty level of each problem.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**:
   - The variable `needed_problems` is initialized to zero.
   - The function then iterates over the `count` list. For each difficulty level, if the count of problems is less than `m`, it calculates the difference (`m - count[i]`) and adds this to `needed_problems`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the function returns `needed_problems`, which is the total number of additional problems required.

### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `a = "BGECDCBDED"`
- Count of problems: `[0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]` (for 'A' to 'G')
- Since `m = 1`, we need at least one problem of each type. We have none of 'A' and 'F', so `needed_problems = 2`.
- Output: `2`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `a = "BGECDCBDED"`
- Count of problems: `[0, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`
- We need at least two problems of each type. We are short by 2 of 'A', 1 of 'B', 1 of 'C', 1 of 'D', 0 of 'E', 1 of 'F', and 1 of 'G'.
- Total additional problems needed: `2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 7 - 2 = 5`
- Output: `5`

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `a = "BBCDEFFGG"`
- Count of problems: `[0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`
- We need at least one problem of each type. We have none of 'A'.
- Output: `1`

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case. Therefore, the solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
