To determine what will be printed by the `print(b, 'B')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided:

### Initial State Analysis:
- The initial state is described as a list `[0, 0, v1, v2, ..., v(2*n-2), v(2*n-1)]`.
- This indicates that the list starts with two zeros, followed by pairs of values (`v1, v2`, `v3, v4`, ..., `v(2*n-2), v(2*n-1)`).

However, there is no explicit mention of a variable `b` in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot directly determine the value of `b` from the given information. 

Given the lack of information about `b`, we can only describe the print statement in terms of `b`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
- The `print(b, 'B')` statement will output the value of `b` followed by the string `'B'`.

Since the value of `b` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot provide a precise numerical or specific value for `b`. We can only describe it symbolically.

### Final Output:
Output: **b B (where b is the value of the variable b)**
