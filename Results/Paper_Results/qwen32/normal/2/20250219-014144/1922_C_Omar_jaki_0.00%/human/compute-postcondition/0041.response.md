`t` is initially `True`, which is equivalent to `1` in Python when used in arithmetic operations. Subtracting `1` from `t` results in `0`, which is equivalent to `False`. The list and `u` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u` is `0`; the list remains `[0, 0, v1, v2, ..., v(2*n-2), v(2*n-1)]`; `t` is `False`**.
