The given code snippet is `v = y - x`. However, the initial state does not specify the values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific value for `v`. Therefore, we can only express `v` in terms of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one and must be greater than or equal to 0; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n+2` integers starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by the original `n` integers in ascending order, and ending with `2000000000.0`; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; `b` is `[0, 0]`; `v` is `y - x`.**
