Let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Understanding `u`**: 
   - `u` is defined as `r()[0] - 3`. 
   - Here, `r()` returns a tuple, and `r()[0]` is the first element of this tuple. 
   - We are also told that `r()[0]` is not 2. Therefore, `u` is not `-1` (since `2 - 3 = -1`).

2. **Understanding the List**:
   - The list `b` is described as `[non-zero, 0, v1, v2, ..., v(2*n-2), v(2*n-1)]`.
   - This means the list starts with a non-zero value, followed by `0`, and then pairs of values `v1, v2, ..., v(2*n-2), v(2*n-1)`.

3. **Understanding `c` and `d`**:
   - `c` and `d` are the values returned by `r()`. 
   - So, `c = r()[0]` and `d = r()[1]`.

4. **The Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])`.
   - We need to determine the values of `b[(d - 1) * 2]` and `b[(c - 1) * 2]` based on the structure of the list `b`.

### Analyzing the Indices:
- Since `b` is structured as `[non-zero, 0, v1, v2, ..., v(2*n-2), v(2*n-1)]`, the indices of interest are:
  - `(d - 1) * 2`
  - `(c - 1) * 2`

### Possible Values:
- Given the structure of `b`, the indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` will point to specific positions in the list `b`:
  - If `d = 1`, then `(d - 1) * 2 = 0`, which points to the first element (`non-zero`).
  - If `d = 2`, then `(d - 1) * 2 = 2`, which points to `v1`.
  - If `d = 3`, then `(d - 1) * 2 = 4`, which points to `v3`, and so on.
  
  Similarly for `c`.

### Conclusion:
- The print statement calculates the difference between the elements at positions `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.
- Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these indices.

### Final Output:
Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where b is the list [non-zero, 0, v1, v2, ..., v(2*n-2), v(2*n-1)], c = r()[0], and d = r()[1])**
