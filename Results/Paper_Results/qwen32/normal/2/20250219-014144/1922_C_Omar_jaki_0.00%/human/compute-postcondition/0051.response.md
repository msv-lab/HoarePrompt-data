To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables defined in the loop head: `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Given the loop:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In each iteration, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values from the tuple `a` and its slices. Specifically:
- `w` takes the value from `a[i]`
- `x` takes the value from `a[i+1]`
- `y` takes the value from `a[i+2]`
- `z` takes the value from `a[i+3]`

At the end of the previous iteration, the values were:
- `w` was `a[1]`
- `x` was `a[2]`
- `y` was `a[3]`
- `z` was `a[4]`

For the next iteration, these variables will take the next set of values from the tuple `a`:
- `w` will be `a[2]`
- `x` will be `a[3]`
- `y` will be `a[4]`
- `z` will be `a[5]`

The other variables (`u`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `v`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`u` is potentially a different value; the list remains potentially modified; `t` is potentially a different value; `a` is a tuple with at least 5 elements, starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by at least three elements returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`; `b` is `[0, 0, v if v > x - w else 1, v if v > z - y else 1, b[-2] + v if y + w > 2x else b[-2] + 1, b[-1] + v if 2y > x + z else b[-1] + 1]`; `v` is `a[3] - a[2]`; `w` is `a[2]`; `x` is `a[3]`; `y` is `a[4]`; `z` is `a[5]`**
