To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop's header. In this case, the loop header is:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables involved here are `i` and `n`. 

Let's analyze the conditions under which the loop will execute:
- The `range(1, n)` function generates numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` will produce no values if `n` is 1 or less.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (this variable is not relevant to the loop condition).
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴.
- `mak` is 0 (this variable is also not relevant to the loop condition).

Since `n` is already specified to be in the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. The variable `i` does not need to be initialized before the loop because it is controlled by the `range` function inside the loop.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the given constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is 0**
