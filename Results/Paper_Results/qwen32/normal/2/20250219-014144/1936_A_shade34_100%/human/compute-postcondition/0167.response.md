The given code snippet resets the list `pans` to an empty list. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, and `mak2` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the highest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `mak2` is the highest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', and `pans` is an empty list.**
