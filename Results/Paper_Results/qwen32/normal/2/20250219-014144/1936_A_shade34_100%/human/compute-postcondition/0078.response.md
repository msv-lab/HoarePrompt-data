The given code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. However, it does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`) are changed by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to its previous value, and `pans` is unchanged.**
