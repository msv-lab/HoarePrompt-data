To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `mak`: This is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'>'`. This means that `mak` holds the index of the last occurrence of `'>'` in the input sequence.
- `mak2`: This variable remains unchanged, so its value is whatever it was set to before this point in the code. Since no specific value is given, we'll denote it as `mak2`.
- `pans`: This is a list or array-like structure, and `pans[mak]` refers to the element at the index `mak` within this list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will output three things separated by spaces:
  1. The literal exclamation mark `'!'`.
  2. The value of `mak2`.
  3. The value of `pans[mak]`.

Given that `mak2` remains unchanged and `mak` is the highest index where the input was `'>'`, the output will be:
- `'!'`: This is a literal string.
- `mak2`: This is the value of `mak2`, which is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we'll denote it as `mak2`.
- `pans[mak]`: This is the element at the index `mak` in the `pans` list. Since `mak` is the highest index where the input was `'>'`, `pans[mak]` will be the value at that specific index in the `pans` list.

### Final Output:
Output: **! mak2 pans[mak] (where mak2 is the unchanged value of mak2 and pans[mak] is the element at index mak in the pans list)**
