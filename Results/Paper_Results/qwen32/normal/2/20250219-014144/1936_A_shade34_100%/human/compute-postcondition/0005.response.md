The given Python code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer to ensure that all buffered output is written to the output device immediately. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `mak` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is 0**.
