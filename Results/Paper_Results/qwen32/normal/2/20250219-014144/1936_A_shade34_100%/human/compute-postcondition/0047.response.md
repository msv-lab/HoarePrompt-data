The code snippet assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. This means `mak` will now hold the value of `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1` from a previous operation, and `mak` was previously the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`.

After executing the line `mak = i`, `mak` is updated to the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the current value of `i`, `mak2` is equal to `mak` if `s` is not `'<'`, otherwise `mak2` is the previous value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` is `'<'`, and if `s` is `'='`, `pans` contains the previous elements plus `i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is the string input from the user.**
