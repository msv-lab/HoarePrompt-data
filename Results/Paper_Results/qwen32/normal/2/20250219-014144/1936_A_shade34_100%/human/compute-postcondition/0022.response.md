To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range is determined by `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is set in a way that allows the loop to execute. Since `n` is already defined as an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once.

The other variables (`t`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, we should ensure that they are in a valid state as per the problem description.

Given that `n` is already within the required range, no adjustment is needed for `n` or `i`. The other variables (`t`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans`) should remain as described in the initial state.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts, adjusted if necessary, remains:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the input was `'<'`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list**.
