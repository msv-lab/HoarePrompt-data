The code snippet provided is `pans.append(i)`. This line appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `i`, we cannot determine the exact value being appended to `pans`. However, we know that `pans` was initially an empty list.

Given that `pans` is now updated to include the value of `i`, the output state will reflect this change. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`, `s` is the string input, `s` is equal to '='**
