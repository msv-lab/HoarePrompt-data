Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is unchanged, `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one, `i` is `i + 1`, `mak` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `mak` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
