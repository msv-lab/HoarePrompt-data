Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `mak` is the largest integer \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i < n\)) for which the input was '<'.
- `mak2` is described identically to `mak` (the largest integer \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i < n\)) for which the input was '<'). This seems like a duplicate definition, so we'll assume `mak2` should be different or is a typo and treat it as the same as `mak` for this explanation.
- `pans` is a list.
- `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Variable Values:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` is the largest integer \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i < n\)) for which the input was '<'.
- `mak2` is the same as `mak` based on the description.
- `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.

### Explanation:
Given the definitions, `mak` and `mak2` are the same value, which is the largest index \(i\) where the input was '<'. The value of `i` is the next integer after the previous value of `i`.

### Output:
The print statement will output a string starting with `'?'`, followed by the value of `mak`, then the value of `mak2` (which is the same as `mak`), then the value of `i`, and finally `mak2` again.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [mak] (where mak is the largest integer i (where 1 â‰¤ i < n) for which the input was '<', and i is the previous value of i plus 1)**
