Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the highest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `mak2` is the highest index i (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', and `pans` contains all indices where the response was '=', or only the last index where the response was '<' if there was one.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `mak2` has been updated to be equal to the value of `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged.
