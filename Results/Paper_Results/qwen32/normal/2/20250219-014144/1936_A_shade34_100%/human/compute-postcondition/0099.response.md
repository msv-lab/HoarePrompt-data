Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the string input, and the current value of `s` is '<'.**
