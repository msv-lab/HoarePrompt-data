The provided code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call does not alter the values of any variables; it merely flushes the output buffer to ensure that all buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1
- `n` is greater than `i`

Since no changes are made to `i` or `n` by the `sys.stdout.flush()` call, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `n` is greater than `i`**.
