To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

From the description, we know:
- `i` is incremented by 1 regardless of the input (either `'<'` or something else).
- `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `mak` is either `i` (if the input was `'<'`) or `0` (otherwise)
- `i` has been incremented by 1 from its value at the start of the previous iteration

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 4 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `mak` is either `i` (if the input was `'<'`) or `0` (otherwise), `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we are only concerned with adjusting the states of objects in the loop head (`i` and `n`), the final state is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is incremented by 1**.

If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

So, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is 4**.

Generalizing this, if `i` was `i_end` at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `i_end + 1`**.

Since the exact value of `i_end` is not specified, we can represent the state as:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is incremented by 1**.

For clarity, let's assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is 4**.

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is incremented by 1**.

If we need a concrete example, assuming `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is 4**.
