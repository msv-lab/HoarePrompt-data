The code assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. Therefore, `mak2` now holds the same value as `mak`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is unchanged, `mak` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', and `pans` is unchanged.**
