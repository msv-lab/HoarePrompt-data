The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to its previous value, and `pans` is unchanged. The value of `mak` is set based on the condition involving the input `<`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was the loop variable at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be incremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to its previous value, `pans` is unchanged, `mak` is unchanged (or set based on the input `<` from the previous iteration), `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we only adjust the loop head variables, we don't specify changes to `mak2`, `pans`, or `mak` in the state description.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `mak2` is equal to its previous value, `pans` is unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**.

To be more precise, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 4, and `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `mak2` is equal to its previous value, `pans` is unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**

If we assume `i` was 3, then:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 4, `mak2` is equal to its previous value, `pans` is unchanged, `i` is 4**
