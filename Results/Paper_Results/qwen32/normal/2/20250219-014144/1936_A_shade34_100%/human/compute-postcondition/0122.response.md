The code snippet appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. The value of `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, and `n` is still greater than `i`. The string `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `s` is the input string, `pans` includes the new element `i` appended to it.**
