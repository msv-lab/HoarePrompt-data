The code snippet `pans = [i]` assigns a new list containing the value of `i` to the variable `pans`. This means that `pans` is no longer an empty list but now contains one element, which is the value of `i`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `pans`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak` is the value of `i`, `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`, `s` is the string input, and the current value of `s` is '<'.**
