The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state description, but since the increment operation is not shown in the provided code snippet, we assume `i` retains its value before appending to `pans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `pans` is a list containing the previous value of `i`, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `s` is the string input by the user.**
