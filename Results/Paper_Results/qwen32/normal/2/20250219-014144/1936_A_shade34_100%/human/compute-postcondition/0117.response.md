To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.
- `n` is greater than `i`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'?'`**: This is a literal string, so it will print `?`.
2. **`mak`**: The value of `mak` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value. We will represent it as `mak`.
3. **`mak2`**: Similarly, the value of `mak2` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value. We will represent it as `mak2`.
4. **`i`**: The initial state tells us that `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1. Without knowing the previous value of `i`, we can only say that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. We will represent it as `i`.
5. **`mak2`**: This is repeated in the print statement, so it will print the same value as `mak2`.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific values for `mak` and `mak2`, we can only describe their values in terms of the variables themselves. The value of `i` is described as being incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Output: **? mak mak2 i mak2 (where mak and mak2 are the values of the variables mak and mak2 respectively, and i is incremented by 1 from its previous value)**
