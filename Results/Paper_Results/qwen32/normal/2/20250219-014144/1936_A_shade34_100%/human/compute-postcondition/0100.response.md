Given the code snippet `mak = i`, the value of `mak` is updated to the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak` is the value of `i`, `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the string input, and the current value of `s` is '<'.**

In simpler terms, the value of `mak` is now set to whatever `i` was, while all other variables retain their previous values.
