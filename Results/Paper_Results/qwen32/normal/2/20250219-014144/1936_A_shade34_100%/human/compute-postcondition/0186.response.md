The code snippet appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `s` remain unchanged. The only change is that `pans` now includes the new element `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is the highest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `mak2` is the highest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the response was '<', `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the user's input as a string, `pans` includes the new element `i`.**
