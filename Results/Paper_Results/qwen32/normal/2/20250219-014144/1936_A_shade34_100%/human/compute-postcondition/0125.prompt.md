Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is unchanged, `mak` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', and `pans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<', and `pans` is a list. If the current value of `s` is '<', then `mak` is updated to the value of `i` and `pans` contains the value of `i`. If `s` is '=', `pans` contains the value of `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is updated to the previous value of `i` plus 1 if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` remains the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<'. `mak2` is the largest integer i (where 1 ≤ i < n) for which the input was '<'. `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` is '<', otherwise it contains the previous value of `i` if `s` is '='. `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, and `s` is the string input by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `n` is greater than `i`, `s` is the input string. If `s` equals `<`, `mak` is equal to `i` and `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`. Otherwise, if `s` equals `=`, `pans` includes the new element `i` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
