The provided code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which does not affect the values of any variables. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. The only change in the state comes from the increment operation on `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `mak` is `i` if the input received is the string `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0
- `i` is incremented by 1

After executing the code, `i` will be incremented by 1, and no other variables will be affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\); `mak` is `i` if the input received is the string `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**
