To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴.
- `mak` is initialized to 0.
- `mak2` is equal to `mak` if the last input was `'<'`, otherwise it retains its previous value. However, `mak2` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore its value for this task.
- `pans` is a list containing at least two elements.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
- `mak` is explicitly set to 0, so `pans[mak]` refers to the first element of the `pans` list, i.e., `pans[0]`.
- The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown from the given information. Therefore, `pans[i]` cannot be determined precisely without knowing the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we know that `pans[mak]` is the first element of the `pans` list (`pans[0]`). However, `pans[i]` depends on the value of `i`, which is not provided.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where [pans[0]] is the first element of the pans list and [pans[i]] is the element at index i of the pans list)**
