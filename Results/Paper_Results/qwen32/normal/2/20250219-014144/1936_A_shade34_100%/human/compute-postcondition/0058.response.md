The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact numerical value. However, we know that `mak` will now hold whatever value `i` holds.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans`) remain unchanged. Given that the current input is `'>'`, `mak2` will retain its previous value because the condition for changing `mak2` (i.e., the last input being `'<'`) is not met.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴, `mak` is equal to `i`, `mak2` is equal to its previous value, `pans` is a list containing at least two elements.**
