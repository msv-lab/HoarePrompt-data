To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

Given:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had some value, and the loop will continue as long as `i <= b`.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

2. **Variable `b`:**
   - The value of `b` does not change within the loop; it is determined before the loop starts and remains constant throughout the loop iterations.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` must be at least 1.
- `suma` is calculated based on the condition given.

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that changes during each iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `suma` is now `2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`. Otherwise, `suma` remains `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**
