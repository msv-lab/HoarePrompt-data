To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables `suma` and `x` evolve with each iteration of the loop. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `suma` starts at 0.
   - `a` and `b` are initialized based on the input.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each iteration `i` from 1 to `b`:
     - Calculate `x` as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
     - If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, add `x` to `suma`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `suma` will hold the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

Let's formalize this into the final output state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `T` remains an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `info` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.
- `a` remains the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` remains the integer value of `info[1]`.
- `suma` will be the sum of all `x` values calculated during the iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.**

In simpler terms, `suma` accumulates the sum of `x` values computed in each iteration where the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true. All other variables retain their initial values.
