Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` if `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0, `suma` is now `2 * ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`. Otherwise, `suma` remains `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**
