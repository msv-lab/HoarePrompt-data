To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

Given:
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, b + 1):`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- `b` is a constant that determines the number of iterations.

Since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

The variable `b` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `b` remains unchanged.

Other variables like `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `x`, and `suma` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings from the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, `suma` is updated by adding `x` to its previous value.**

However, specifically focusing on the loop head variables:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `b` must be at least 1**.

If we assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`i` is 4, `b` must be at least 1**.

Thus, the final adjusted state considering only the loop head variables is:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `b` must be at least 1**.

Or more specifically:

State: **`i` is 4, `b` must be at least 1**.
