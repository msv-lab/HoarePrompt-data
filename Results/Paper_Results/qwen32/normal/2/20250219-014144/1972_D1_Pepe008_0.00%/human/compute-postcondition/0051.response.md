To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

Given:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was incremented by 1.
- `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `info` is a list of substrings from the input line.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` must be at least 1.
- `suma` is `x` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, otherwise `suma` remains 0, and `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used in the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0` to determine `suma`. Now, for the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Adjust `i`:** Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
2. **Check `b`:** The loop will continue as long as `i <= b`. Therefore, `b` does not need to be changed unless the loop condition fails.

Given that `i` was the loop variable and it was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 again to get the state at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings from the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `suma` is `x` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) > 0`, otherwise `suma` remains 0, and `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**

However, since `suma` and `x` are dependent on the current value of `i` and will be recalculated in the next iteration, we don't need to specify their exact values here. We just need to ensure `i` is incremented.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings from the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1.**
