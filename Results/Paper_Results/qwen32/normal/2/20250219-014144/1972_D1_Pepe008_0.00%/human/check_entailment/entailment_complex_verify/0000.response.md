### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program and verifies the incorrectness through test cases. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - We need to find ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It then calculates a sum `suma` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` for \(i\) ranging from 1 to \(b\).
   - If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - **Incorrect Formula**: The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not accurately represent the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - **Logic Error**: The logic in the loop does not correctly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, especially when \(a\) or \(b\) are small.

4. **Verification with Test Cases**:
   - **Test Case 1**: Input `1 1` should output `1`, but the program outputs `0`.
   - **Test Case 2**: Input `2 3` should output `3`, but the program outputs `1`.
   - **Test Case 3**: Input `3 5` should output `4`, but the program outputs `1`.
   - **Test Case 4**: Input `10 8` should output `14`, but the program outputs `1`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program consistently produces incorrect results across multiple test cases.
   - The logic and formula used in the program do not align with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the detailed analysis and verification, the program is indeed incorrect.

**Final: False**
