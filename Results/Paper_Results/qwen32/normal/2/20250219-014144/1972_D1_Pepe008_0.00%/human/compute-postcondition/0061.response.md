To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and accumulates results.

### Analysis of the Loop:
- The outer loop runs `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the following steps occur:
  - Read two integers `a` and `b`.
  - Initialize `suma` to 0.
  - Iterate `i` from 1 to `b` (inclusive).
  - For each `i`, compute `x` as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.
  - Add `x` to `suma`.
  - After the inner loop, print `suma - 1`.

### Final Output State:
After all `T` iterations, the loop will have processed each test case independently. Each iteration of the outer loop does not affect the next one except for the input reading. Therefore, the final output state will be determined by the last test case processed.

### Description of the Final Output State:
- `t` will be equal to `T` because it increments with each iteration of the outer loop.
- `T` remains the same as the initial input value representing the number of test cases.
- `info` will be the list of strings from the last input line.
- `a` and `b` will be the integer values from the last input line.
- `suma` will be the sum of all `x` values calculated during the iterations of the inner loop for the last test case where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.
- The final printed value will be `suma - 1` for the last test case.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is equal to `T`, `T` is the number of test cases, `info` is the list of strings from the last input line, `a` and `b` are the integer values from the last input line, `suma` is the accumulated sum of `x` for the last test case where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, and the final printed value is `suma - 1`.**
