Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

Given this, we can simplify the condition to:
\[ a = (k-1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

Since \(\gcd(a, b)\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\), let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[ d \cdot a' = (k-1) \cdot d \cdot b' \cdot d \]
\[ a' = (k-1) \cdot b' \cdot d \]

This implies that \(a'\) must be a multiple of \(b'\). Since \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\), the only solution is \(a' = (k-1) \cdot b'\) and \(d = 1\). Therefore, \(a = (k-1) \cdot b\).

Thus, for each \(b\), we need to count the number of valid \(a\) values such that \(a = (k-1) \cdot b\) and \(1 \leq a \leq n\).

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a different approach. Let's break down the logic:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            x = (n - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if n - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)
```

#### Explanation of the Program Logic

1. **Loop through each possible value of \(b\) (from 1 to \(m\)):**
   - For each \(b\), calculate the maximum possible \(k\) such that \(a = (k-1) \cdot b \leq n\).
   - This is equivalent to finding the largest integer \(k\) such that \((k-1) \cdot b \leq n\), which simplifies to \(k \leq \frac{n}{b} + 1\).

2. **Calculate the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\):**
   - The number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\) is the number of integers \(k\) from 1 to \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).
   - This is calculated as \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).

3. **Sum up the counts for all \(b\):**
   - The variable `suma` accumulates the total count of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

4. **Adjust the final result:**
   - The program subtracts 1 from the final result, which seems incorrect based on the problem statement.

### Correctness Check

The program logic seems mostly correct except for the final adjustment (`suma - 1`). The subtraction of 1 is not justified based on the problem requirements.

### Conclusion

The provided program is almost correct but has an unnecessary subtraction of 1 at the end. To fix it, we should remove the `- 1` in the `print(suma - 1)` statement.

However, since the task is to determine the correctness based on the given program, we conclude:

**Correctness: False**

The program would produce incorrect results due to the unnecessary subtraction of 1.
