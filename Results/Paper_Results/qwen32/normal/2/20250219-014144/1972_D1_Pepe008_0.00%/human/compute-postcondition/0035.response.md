The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration of the loop. According to the loop statement, `i` ranges from 1 to `b` inclusive.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is \(i + 1\).
- The loop condition is `for i in range(1, b + 1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value. Since `i` was just incremented at the end of the previous iteration, we need to set `i` to the next integer value it should take in the sequence.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is \(i + 1\), `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\). If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), `suma` is updated to `suma + x`**.

To adjust for the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.

Since `i` was just incremented at the end of the previous iteration, we need to reflect this increment in the state.

Adjusted State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is \(i + 1\), `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\). If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), `suma` is updated to `suma + x`**.

However, to clearly indicate the next value of `i`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is \(i + 1\), `x` is \((a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1)\). If \(a - (i + 1) * i > 0\), `suma` is updated to `suma + x`**

But since `i` was already incremented at the end of the previous iteration, the correct state representation before the next loop starts should reflect that `i` is now the next value in the sequence:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is \(i + 1\)**

So the final adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is \(i + 1\)**

This means `i` is now the next integer in the sequence, ready for the next iteration of the loop.
