The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of substrings using whitespace as the delimiter. This list is then assigned to the variable `info`. The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `T` is an integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings from the input line.**
