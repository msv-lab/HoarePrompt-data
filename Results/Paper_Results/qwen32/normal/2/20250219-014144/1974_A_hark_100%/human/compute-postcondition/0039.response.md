The `print(0)` statement in the given Python code snippet explicitly prints the integer `0`. This is independent of the values of the variables `t`, `ap`, `x`, `y`, and `k` as none of these variables are used within the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides details about the variables `t`, `ap`, `x`, `y`, and `k`, but these details are not relevant to the `print` statement.
2. The `print(0)` statement directly outputs the integer `0`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `0`.

Output: **0**
