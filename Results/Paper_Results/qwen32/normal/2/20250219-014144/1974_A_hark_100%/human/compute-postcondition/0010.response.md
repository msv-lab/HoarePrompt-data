To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code execution step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `ap` is greater than 0.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is a positive integer, and `y` is greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

### Analysis:
- The code uses the `math.ceil()` function, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
- The expression inside the `math.ceil()` function is `y / 2`.

### Calculation:
- Since `y` is a positive integer, `y / 2` will result in either an integer (if `y` is even) or a floating-point number with a fractional part of 0.5 (if `y` is odd).
- `math.ceil(y / 2)` will round this result up to the nearest integer.

### Possible Values:
- If `y` is even (e.g., 2, 4, 6, ...), `y / 2` is already an integer, so `math.ceil(y / 2)` will return `y / 2`.
- If `y` is odd (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...), `y / 2` will have a fractional part of 0.5, so `math.ceil(y / 2)` will round it up to the next whole number, which is `(y // 2) + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2` (where `y` is a positive integer)**
