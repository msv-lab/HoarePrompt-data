Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any direct parameters. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. For each test case, it receives two integers `x` and `y`, both ranging from 0 to 99 inclusive. The function returns the sum of `x` and `y` for each test case.**
