The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. After executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated to whatever integers are provided in the input, while the other variables (`t`, `ap`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the integers provided in the input, and `k` is incremented by 1.**
