The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`. It then calculates and prints a value based on the conditions involving `x` and `y`. Specifically, it computes the minimum number of operations needed to reduce `x` and `y` to zero using specific rules, and prints this value for each test case.
