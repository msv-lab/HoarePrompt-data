To determine what will be printed by the `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `ap` is greater than 0.
- `x` and `y` are integers provided in the input.
- `k` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```

### Analysis:
- The `math.ceil()` function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the specified number.
- The expression inside the `math.ceil()` function is `x / 15`, where `x` is an integer provided in the input.

### Calculation:
- To find out what will be printed, we need to know the value of `x`.
- Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `x`.

### Output Description:
- The code will print the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`.

### Final Output:
Output: **the smallest integer greater than or equal to x / 15 (where x is the provided integer input)**
