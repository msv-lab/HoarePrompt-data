Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `x == 0` and `y > 0`, the specific actions within the if block are taken (though not detailed here). Regardless of the condition, `k` is incremented by 1.**
