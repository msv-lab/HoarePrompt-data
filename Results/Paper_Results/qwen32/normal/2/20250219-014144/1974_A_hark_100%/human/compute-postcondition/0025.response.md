To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `ap` is greater than 0.
- `x` and `y` are two integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
- `k` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(y / 2))
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet uses the `math.ceil` function, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
- The argument passed to `math.ceil` is `y / 2`, where `y` is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive.

### Possible Values of `y / 2`:
- If `y = 0`, then `y / 2 = 0.0`, and `math.ceil(0.0) = 0`.
- If `y = 1`, then `y / 2 = 0.5`, and `math.ceil(0.5) = 1`.
- If `y = 2`, then `y / 2 = 1.0`, and `math.ceil(1.0) = 1`.
- If `y = 3`, then `y / 2 = 1.5`, and `math.ceil(1.5) = 2`.
- This pattern continues, with `math.ceil(y / 2)` effectively rounding `y / 2` up to the nearest whole number.

### General Formula:
- For any integer `y` in the range [0, 99], `math.ceil(y / 2)` will yield an integer result that is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to half of `y`.

### Final Output:
Output: **math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive)**
