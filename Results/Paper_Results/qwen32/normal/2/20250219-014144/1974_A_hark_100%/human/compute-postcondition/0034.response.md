The value of `x` is updated based on the given formula: `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. The values of `t`, `ap`, `k`, and `bxsfory` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is greater than 0, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is the integer provided in the input, `k` is incremented by 1, and `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`**.
