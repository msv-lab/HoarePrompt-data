To determine the output of the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and understand the components involved:

### Initial State Breakdown

- **List Construction**: The list is constructed as `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]`.
- **Exclusion**: The value `2^i` is excluded from this list.

### Understanding the Components

- **`k - (1 << i)`**: This represents `k` minus `2^i`.
- **`k + 1`**: This is simply `k` plus one.
- **`k + 1 + (1 << i)`**: This represents `k` plus one plus `2^i`.
- **Powers of 2**: The list includes powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^20`.

### Exclusion of `2^i`

- The value `2^i` is excluded from the list. This means that if `2^i` is present in the list of powers of 2, it will be removed.

### Determining the Output

Given the above information, the list `ans` will contain all the elements mentioned in the initial state except for the specific value `2^i`.

### Example Calculation

Let's assume some values for `k` and `i` to illustrate the construction of the list:

- Suppose `k = 100` and `i = 3`.
- `1 << i` would be `2^3` which is `8`.

The list would then be:
\[ [100 - 8, 100 + 1, 100 + 1 + 8, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072] \]

Which simplifies to:
\[ [92, 101, 109, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072] \]

Since `2^i` is `8`, it will be excluded from the list. Thus, the final list `ans` would be:
\[ [92, 101, 109, 1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072] \]

### Generalizing the Output

Without specific values for `k` and `i`, we can describe the output as follows:

The list `ans` will include:
- `k - 2^i`
- `k + 1`
- `k + 1 + 2^i`
- Powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^20`, excluding `2^i`

### Final Output

Output: **[k - 2^i, k + 1, k + 1 + 2^i, 1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072] (excluding 2^i)**
