The code snippet reassigns the list `ans` to contain three specific values: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. This means the new `ans` list will only include these three elements, discarding all previous elements.

Therefore, the updated `ans` list will be `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `n` is still an input integer.
- `k` is still an input integer.
- `i` is still `i_final` (the highest integer such that `1 << i_final <= k`).
- `tc` is still 3.
- The list remains as described in the initial state but is not relevant to the output state since `ans` has been reassigned.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `i_final`, `tc` is 3, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`**.
