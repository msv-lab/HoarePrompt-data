You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        i = 0
        
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        
        print(len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output consists of the length of the list `ans` followed by the elements of the list `ans`, where `ans` is constructed as described above for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then constructs a list `ans` based on the value of `k` and prints the length of this list followed by its elements.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
- The sequence should satisfy two conditions:
  1. There should be no subsequence of `a` that sums to `k`.
  2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The provided program generates a sequence `a` based on the value of `k`. Let's break down the logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
3. It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` (denoted as `1 << i`).
4. It constructs the sequence `ans` with specific values:
   - `k - (1 << i)`
   - `k + 1`
   - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`
   - All powers of 2 except `1 << i` up to `1 << 19`
5. It prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - The sequence should not allow any subsequence to sum to `k`.
   - The constructed sequence includes `k - (1 << i)` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. Depending on the value of `i`, it might be possible to form `k` using these elements.
   
2. **Subsequences Summing to Other Values:**
   - The sequence should allow forming all sums from `1` to `n` except `k`.
   - Including all powers of 2 up to `1 << 19` ensures that many sums can be formed, but we need to verify that all sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) can indeed be formed.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider a few test cases to see if the program works correctly.

#### Test Case 1:
```
Input:
1
2 2

Expected Output:
1
1

Explanation:
- The only valid sum is 1, which can be formed by the sequence [1].
- No subsequence sums to 2.
```
The program outputs:
```
1
1
```
This seems correct.

#### Test Case 2:
```
Input:
1
6 1

Expected Output:
5
2 3 4 5 6

Explanation:
- All sums from 2 to 6 can be formed.
- No subsequence sums to 1.
```
The program outputs:
```
21
0 3 5 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36
```
This does not seem correct because it includes many unnecessary large numbers and does not guarantee that all sums from 2 to 6 can be formed with the smallest possible sequence.

#### Test Case 3:
```
Input:
1
8 8

Expected Output:
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Explanation:
- All sums from 1 to 7 can be formed.
- No subsequence sums to 8.
```
The program outputs:
```
21
0 5 9 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36
```
Again, this does not seem correct for the same reasons as above.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and testing, the program does not consistently generate sequences that meet the problem's requirements. Specifically, the sequences generated do not guarantee that all sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) can be formed with the smallest possible sequence, and they may include unnecessary large numbers.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
