To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **Variables:**
   - `n`: An input integer (not used in the provided code snippet).
   - `k`: An input integer.
   - `tc`: Set to 2 (not used in the provided code snippet).
   - `i`: The largest integer such that \(2^{(i + 1)} > k\).

2. **List Construction:**
   - The list is constructed as `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`.

3. **Determination of `i`:**
   - `i` is determined by finding the largest integer such that \(2^{(i + 1)} > k\). This means `i` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`.

4. **List `ans`:**
   - The list `ans` is the same as the constructed list but excludes the value `2^i`.

### Calculation Steps

1. **Determine `i`:**
   - Given `k`, find the largest `i` such that \(2^{(i + 1)} > k\).
   - For example, if `k = 10`, then \(2^4 = 16\) is the smallest power of 2 greater than 10, so `i = 3`.

2. **Construct the List:**
   - Calculate `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
   - Construct the rest of the list as `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]`.
   - Exclude `2^i` from the list.

3. **Form the Final List `ans`:**
   - Combine the calculated values and the predefined list, excluding `2^i`.

### Example Calculation

Let's take an example where `k = 10`:

1. **Determine `i`:**
   - \(2^4 = 16\) is the smallest power of 2 greater than 10, so `i = 3`.

2. **Calculate Values:**
   - `k - (1 << i) = 10 - 8 = 2`
   - `k + 1 = 11`
   - `k + 1 + (1 << i) = 11 + 8 = 19`

3. **Construct the List:**
   - The list is `[2, 11, 19, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]`.
   - Exclude `2^i = 8` from the list.

4. **Final List `ans`:**
   - The final list `ans` is `[2, 11, 19, 1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]`.

### General Case

For any `k`, the list `ans` will be constructed similarly, excluding `2^i` from the combined list.

### Output

Given the above steps and the general construction of the list `ans`, the output will be the list `ans` excluding `2^i`.

Output: **[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072] excluding 2^i (where i is the largest integer such that 2^(i + 1) > k)**
