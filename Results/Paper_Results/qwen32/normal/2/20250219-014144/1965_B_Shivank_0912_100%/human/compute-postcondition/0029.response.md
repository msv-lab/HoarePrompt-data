The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so after the increment, `i` becomes 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, the list, `tc`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 2, the list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`, `tc` is 2, `i` is 1**
