The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the initial state's list of values `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i` and the variable `tc` with a value of 2 remain unchanged except for `n` and `k` which are updated.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the list is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072]` excluding the value `2^i`, `tc` is 2**.
