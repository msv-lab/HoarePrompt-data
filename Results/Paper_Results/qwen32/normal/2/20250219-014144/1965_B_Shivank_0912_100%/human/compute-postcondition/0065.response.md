The given code snippet appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, so `1 << j` evaluates to `1 << 1`, which is 2. This means the value 2 is appended to the list `ans`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `tc`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `i` is `i_final`, `tc` is 3, `j` is 1, `ans` contains the value 2.**
