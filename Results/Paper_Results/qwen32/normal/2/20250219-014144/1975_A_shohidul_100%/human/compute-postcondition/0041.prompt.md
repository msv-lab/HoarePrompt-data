Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is `False` indicating that `a` is not sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is `False`. At the current index `i`, if `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then `new` is a list containing elements from `a[i:]`. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` (or both), and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is `False`; `i` is 4. If `a[3] > a[4]`, then `new` is a list containing elements from index 4 to the end of `a`; `check_all_new` is `True` or `False` depending on whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`; `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of whether `check_all_new and new_all` is true or false, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[3] <= a[4]`, none of the additional variables (`new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) are defined or modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than 5; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is `False`; `i` is 5. If `a[4] > a[5]`, then `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index 5 to the end; `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0] >= new[i]` for all `i` in the range of `len(new)`, otherwise `False`; `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True` or `False`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
