Functionality: **The function evaluates multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines if the array can be made non-decreasing by potentially removing a prefix of the array. It prints 'YES' if the array can be made non-decreasing in this manner, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
