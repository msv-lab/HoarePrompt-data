Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `check_all` is set to False, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, and `new` (a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list) is checked. If `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both True, all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]` and non-decreasing. Otherwise, either `check_all_new` is False or `new_all` is False, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, `check_all` retains its original value.**
