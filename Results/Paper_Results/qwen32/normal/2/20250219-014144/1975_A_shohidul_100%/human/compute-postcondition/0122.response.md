Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a list of integers; `check_all` is True if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements, otherwise False; `_` is 1; if `check_all` was initially False, then `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order and `i` is equal to `n`.**
