To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The conditions related to `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` are evaluated based on the current value of `i`, but these do not affect the loop head.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (i.e., `i` is now `i + 1`)**

Since we don't have the specific value of `i` from the previous iteration, we express the new state in terms of the increment:

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
