Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if each element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element in `new`, otherwise `new_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether `check_all_new and new_all` is `True` or `False`. If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, no additional changes are made to the variables `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`.**
