To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided information.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
2. **Condition Check**: For each iteration, it checks if `a[i-1] > a[i]`.
3. **Sublist Creation**: If the condition is true, it creates a sublist `new` starting from index `i` to the end of the list `a`.
4. **Check Conditions**:
   - `check_all_new`: Checks if all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`.
   - `new_all`: Checks if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
5. **Decision Making**:
   - If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, it prints 'YES' and breaks the loop.
   - If either is false, it prints 'NO' and breaks the loop.
6. **No Break Condition**: If `a[i-1] <= a[i]`, the loop continues to the next iteration without breaking.

### Output States:
- **After 1st Iteration**: The loop has checked the first pair of elements (`a[0]` and `a[1]`). Depending on the comparison, it may or may not break.
- **After 2nd Iteration**: The loop has checked the second pair of elements (`a[1]` and `a[2]`). Again, it may or may not break.
- **After 3rd Iteration**: The loop has checked the third pair of elements (`a[2]` and `a[3]`). It may or may not break.

### Final Output State:
The loop will continue until it either finds a pair where `a[i-1] > a[i]` and meets the conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO', or it completes all iterations without finding such a pair.

- If the loop completes all iterations without finding any pair where `a[i-1] > a[i]` and meeting the conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO', it means the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements, and `check_all` remains True.
- If the loop finds a pair where `a[i-1] > a[i]` and meets the conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO', it will print 'YES' or 'NO' and terminate early.

Given the information, the final output state depends on whether the loop breaks early or completes all iterations. However, since the problem does not specify that the loop breaks early, we assume it completes all iterations.

### Conclusion:
If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, the final output state will be that `check_all` remains True, and the loop will not print 'YES' or 'NO'. Since the problem does not specify further actions after completing all iterations, we can infer that the loop simply ends without additional outputs.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is True if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the `n-1` elements, otherwise False.**
