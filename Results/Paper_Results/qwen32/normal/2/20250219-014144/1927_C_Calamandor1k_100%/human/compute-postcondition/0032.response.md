The given code snippet contains only the `continue` statement, which does not affect the values of any variables or the overall state of the program. It is typically used within loops to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one.

Given that there is no change in any variable's value due to the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple (n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next) where n_next and m_next are integers such that 1 ≤ n_next, m_next ≤ 2·10^5, k_next is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k_next ≤ 2·min(n_next, m_next), a_next is a list of n_next integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, b_next is a list of m_next integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6, `results` is a list containing the strings `'YES'` and `'NO'`, `unique_a` is a set containing the unique elements of `a_next`, `unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements of `b_next`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` which are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` which are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` which are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` which are not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.**
