You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case in the list 'cases' is a tuple containing three parts: (1) a tuple (n, m, k) where n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5 and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m); (2) a list a of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; (3) a list b of m integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. The sum of all n and m across all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5.
def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
        unique_a = set(a)
        
        unique_b = set(b)
        
        relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
        
        relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
        
        only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
        
        only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
        
        both = relevant_a & relevant_b
        
        if len(only_a) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        if len(only_b) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
        
        if total_distinct < k:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        results.append('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples (n, m, k, a, b) where n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, b is a list of m integers where each integer b_j satisfies 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6. `results` is a list containing `t` strings, each either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, determined by the conditions specified in the loop.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` strings, each either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, determined by the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three parts: (1) a tuple `(n, m, k)` where `n` and `m` are integers representing the lengths of two lists, and `k` is an even integer; (2) a list `a` of `n` integers; and (3) a list `b` of `m` integers. The function processes each test case and returns a list `results` containing `t` strings, each either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, based on unspecified conditions within the function.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `results` containing `t` strings, each either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, determined by the conditions specified in the loop.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
