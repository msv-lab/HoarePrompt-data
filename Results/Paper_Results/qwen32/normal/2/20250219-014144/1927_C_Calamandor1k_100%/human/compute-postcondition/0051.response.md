The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the state of the program outside of the loop. Since there is no loop explicitly mentioned in the context, the `continue` statement here seems to imply that the current iteration of a loop should be skipped, but without a loop structure, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the state.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `cases`, `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, `both`, `results`) are modified by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple `(n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next)`, and the next tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` is the next item in `cases` to be processed; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`; `both` is a set containing elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `results` contains an additional element `'NO'`.**
