You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `cases` containing `t` tuples. Each tuple includes integers `n` and `m` indicating the lengths of two lists, an even integer `k`, and two lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, the function evaluates whether certain conditions related to the elements of lists `a` and `b` and the value of `k` are met. It returns a list of `t` strings, each either `'YES'` or `'NO'`, based on these evaluations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it determines whether it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays \(a\) and \(b\) such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included among the chosen elements.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of arrays \(a\) and \(b\) (\(n\) and \(m\)), and the integer \(k\).
   - It then reads the elements of arrays \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` from arrays \(a\) and \(b\) respectively to get unique elements.
   - It filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to \(k\), resulting in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
   - It calculates the sets `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`:
     - `only_a`: Elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.
     - `only_b`: Elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`.
     - `both`: Elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
   - It checks if the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\). If so, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - It calculates the total number of distinct elements that can be chosen from both arrays (`total_distinct`).
   - If `total_distinct` is less than \(k\), it appends 'NO' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'YES'.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify if the program handles all potential cases correctly:

1. **Handling Elements Greater Than \(k\):**
   - The program correctly filters out elements greater than \(k\) from both arrays, ensuring only relevant elements are considered.

2. **Checking Element Counts:**
   - The program ensures that the number of elements in `only_a` and `only_b` does not exceed \(\frac{k}{2}\). This is crucial because if more than \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements are unique to one array, it would be impossible to select \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from the other array to cover all integers from 1 to \(k\).

3. **Total Distinct Elements:**
   - The program calculates the total number of distinct elements that can be chosen from both arrays. If this number is less than \(k\), it correctly returns 'NO' because it is impossible to cover all integers from 1 to \(k\).

### Edge Cases Considered

- **All Elements in Both Arrays Are Relevant:**
  - If all elements in both arrays are between 1 and \(k\), the program correctly checks if the total number of distinct elements is at least \(k\).

- **No Overlap Between Arrays:**
  - If there is no overlap between the elements of arrays \(a\) and \(b\), the program correctly checks if the combined number of unique elements from both arrays is at least \(k\).

- **One Array Has All Elements:**
  - If one array has all elements from 1 to \(k\) and the other has none, the program correctly checks if the number of elements in the array with all elements is at least \(k\).

- **Minimum and Maximum Values of \(k\):**
  - The program handles the minimum value of \(k\) (which is 2) and maximum values of \(n\) and \(m\) (up to \(2 \times 10^5\)) efficiently.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to handle all potential cases correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to produce the correct output based on the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases by filtering elements, checking counts, and ensuring that the total number of distinct elements is sufficient to cover all integers from 1 to \(k\).
