The code snippet creates a set named `unique_b` from the list `b`. This means `unique_b` will contain all unique elements from `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list containing at least one tuple `(n_next, m_next, k_next, a_next, b_next)`, and the next tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` is the next item in `cases` to be processed; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from the list `b`.**
