In this task, we are given an initial state where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `s` is a string input by the user. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet does not depend on either `t` or `s`. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is described as an integer within a specific range, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
2. The variable `s` is described as a string input by the user, but it is also not used in the `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`.

Given this information, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not vary based on the values of `t` or `s`.

Output: **No**
