Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is a string with a length greater than 1. If all characters in `s` are identical, then `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is either the string `s` rotated by moving its first character to the end or a string containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order. If `s` equals `s2`, then `s2` is specifically the string `s` rotated by moving its first character to the end.**
