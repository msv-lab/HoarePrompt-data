To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variable `t`:** It is an integer with a value between 1 and 1000 inclusive. However, the value of `t` does not affect the print statement in the code snippet.
2. **Variable `s`:** It is a string input by the user. The exact content of this string is not specified, but it is relevant for determining the value of `s2`.
3. **Variable `s2`:** This string is determined based on the value of `s`. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end of the string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`.
- The value of `t`, `s`, and `s2` do not influence the output of this specific print statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
