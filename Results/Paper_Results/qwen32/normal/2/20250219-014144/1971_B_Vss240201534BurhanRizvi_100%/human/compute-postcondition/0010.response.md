The code snippet `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` rotates the string `s` by moving its first character to the end. Given that `s` and `s2` were initially the same, after executing this line, `s2` will be the rotated version of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a string input by the user with a length greater than 1 and characters not all identical, `s2` is the string `s` rotated by moving its first character to the end.**
