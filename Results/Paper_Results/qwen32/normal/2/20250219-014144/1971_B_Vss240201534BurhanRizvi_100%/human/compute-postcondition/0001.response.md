The code snippet `s = input()` reads a new string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. This means that the original value of `s` (which was a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters) is replaced by whatever new string is provided as input.

Since `t` is not modified by the code snippet, its value remains the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the new string input by the user.**
