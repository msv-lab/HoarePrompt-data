### Reasoning:

1. **Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies that a string of length 1 cannot be rearranged to form a different string and outputs "NO".
   
2. **Strings with All Identical Characters**: The program correctly identifies that if a string consists of all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa"), it cannot be rearranged to form a different string and outputs "NO".

3. **Other Strings**: For strings that can be rearranged to form a different string, the program attempts to generate a random permutation of the string using `random.sample(s, len(s))`. If the generated permutation is the same as the original string, it falls back to a simple rotation (`s[1:] + s[0]`) to ensure the output is different from the original string.

4. **Output Format**: The program outputs "YES" followed by the rearranged string when a valid rearrangement is found.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as very short strings and strings with repeated characters appropriately.

### Correctness:
The program appears to handle all specified cases correctly based on the logic described and the provided examples. It ensures that the rearranged string is different from the original string when possible and outputs "NO" when it is not possible to rearrange the string to meet the criteria.

**Correctness: True**
