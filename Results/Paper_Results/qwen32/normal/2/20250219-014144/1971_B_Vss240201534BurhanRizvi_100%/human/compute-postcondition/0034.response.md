Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is the string input by the user.
- `s2` is determined based on a comparison between `s` and `s2`. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` remains the original string `s`. Otherwise, `s2` becomes the string `s[1:] + s[0]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. This output does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`. It is a static string that gets printed regardless of the conditions or values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is always `'Yes'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
