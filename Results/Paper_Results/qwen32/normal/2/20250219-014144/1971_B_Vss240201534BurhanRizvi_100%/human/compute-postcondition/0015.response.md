Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is a string input by the user. If the length of `s` is 1, `s` remains unchanged. If the length of `s` is greater than 1, `s` either remains unchanged if all characters are identical, or is transformed into either a rotation of itself (by moving the first character to the end) or a random permutation of its characters. If the transformation results in `s` being equal to its rotated version, then `s` is specifically the rotated version.**
