Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a string input by the user with a length greater than 1 and characters not all identical, and `s2` is either the string `s` rotated by moving its first character to the end or a string containing the same characters as `s` but in a random order. If `s` equals `s2`, then `s2` is specifically the string `s` rotated by moving its first character to the end.**
