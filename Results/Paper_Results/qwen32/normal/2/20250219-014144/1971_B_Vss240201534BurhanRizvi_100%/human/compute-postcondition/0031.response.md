Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the string input by the user; `s2` is a permutation of the string `s`.**

Natural Language: The value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The value of `s` remains the same as the string input by the user. A new variable `s2` is introduced, which is a permutation of the characters in the string `s`.
