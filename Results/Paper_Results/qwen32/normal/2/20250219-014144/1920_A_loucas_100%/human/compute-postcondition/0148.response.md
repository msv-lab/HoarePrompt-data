To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the initial state provided. However, there is no specific information about the variable `num` in the initial state description. Since the variable `num` is not explicitly defined or given a value in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value.

Given this lack of information, the best we can do is describe the output in terms of the variable `num`.

Output: **num (where num is the value assigned to the variable num)**
