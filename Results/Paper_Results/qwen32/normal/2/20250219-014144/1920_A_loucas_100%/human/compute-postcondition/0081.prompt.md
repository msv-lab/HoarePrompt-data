Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, and `innerLoop` is the integer value provided by the input.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the integer `a` if `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, otherwise `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, and `a` is the second integer from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` contains the integer `a` if `x` was 2, `big` contains the integer `a` if `x` was 1, `no` contains the integer `a` if `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, and `iterable2` is `iterable2 + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` contains the integer `a` if `x` was 2, `big` contains the integer `a` if `x` was 1, `no` contains the integer `a` if `x` was neither 1 nor 2 and also contains the new integer `a` if `x` was not 2, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, and `iterable2` is incremented by 1. If `x` was 1, `big` includes the integer `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
