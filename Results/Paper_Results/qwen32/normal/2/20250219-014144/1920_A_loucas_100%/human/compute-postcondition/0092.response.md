Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1, `no` contains at least one integer, and `i` is the next element in `no` after the current `i`. `num` is decreased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `num` has been reduced by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
