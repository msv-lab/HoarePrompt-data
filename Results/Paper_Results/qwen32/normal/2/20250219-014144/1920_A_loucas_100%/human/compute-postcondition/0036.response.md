Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1, `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1` and `num` is less than 1, `innerLoop` is the number of iterations the loop ran.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect any variables or their values. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Thus, all variables retain their initial values and states.
