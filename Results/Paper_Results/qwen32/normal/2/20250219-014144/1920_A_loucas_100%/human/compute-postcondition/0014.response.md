Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, there are `n-1` lines remaining containing two integers `a` and `x` where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` is greater than 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `x` is not equal to 1, and `x` is not equal to 2**
