To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `a3` and `l3`.

Given the loop:
```python
for (a3, l3) in val:
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know from the problem statement that:
- `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7])]`.
- The loop iterates over each tuple in `val`.

Since `val` contains only one tuple `(4, [5, 6, 7])`, the loop will execute exactly once. After this iteration, there are no more tuples to iterate over, so the loop will terminate.

However, let's assume hypothetically that `val` could contain more tuples for the sake of understanding how to adjust the state for the next iteration:

1. **At the start of the first iteration:**
   - `a3` would be `4`.
   - `l3` would be `[5, 6, 7]`.

2. **After the first iteration:**
   - Since `val` contains only one tuple, there are no more tuples to iterate over.

Given the current state description and the fact that `val` contains only one tuple, the loop will not execute a second time. Therefore, there is no "next iteration" to prepare for.

However, if we were to consider what the state would look like if `val` had more tuples, the state at the start of the next iteration would involve the next tuple in `val`.

For completeness, let's assume hypothetically `val` was `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10])]`. After the first iteration, the state at the start of the second iteration would be:

- `a3` would be `8`.
- `l3` would be `[9, 10]`.

But since `val` only contains one tuple, the loop will not execute a second time. Therefore, the final state considering the given `val` is:

State: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx1 <= idx2`; `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7])]`. The loop terminates as there are no more tuples to iterate over.**
