To determine what will be printed by the `print('no')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `m` is at least 3.
- `n` is an integer read from the input.
- `a1` is the first integer from the next input line.
- `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1 >= idx2`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged.
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input line.
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`).
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
- `l11` is not equal to `l22`.
- `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 2`.
- `idx2` is not -1.
- `p1` is 0.
- `p2` is 0.
- The loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration).
- `val` contains `m - 2` elements if `idx1 < idx2`, or `m - 1` elements if `idx1 > idx2`, each element being a tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
- `a3` is the next integer from the input.
- `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the input with `a3` removed.

### Analysis:
Given the conditions and the state of the program, the `print('no')` statement will execute under specific circumstances. The key point here is that the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration). This implies that the conditions within the loop did not meet the criteria to set `idx1` to a non-negative value during the iterations.

### Conclusion:
The `print('no')` statement will output the string `'no'` because the loop did not find a suitable condition to set `idx1` to a non-negative value during its iterations, leading to the conclusion that the required conditions were not met.

Output: **no**
