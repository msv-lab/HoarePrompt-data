The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables; it merely causes the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, none of the variables (`m`, `_`, `t`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`) are modified. The condition that `idx2` is updated to `n - 2` if `idx2` is `-1` and `idx1` is not `-1` is not executed because the `continue` statement would have skipped this part of the code in the current iteration.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`m` is 2; `_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1` if `idx2` was initially `-1`; `p1` and `p2` are either `0` or `1` depending on whether `a2` or `a1` was encountered in `l1` or `l2` respectively; `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.**
