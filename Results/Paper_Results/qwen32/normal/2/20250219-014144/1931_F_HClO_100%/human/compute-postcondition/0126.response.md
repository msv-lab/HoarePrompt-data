To determine what will be printed by the `print('no')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the context of the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `m`: At least 3.
   - `n`: An integer read from the input.
   - `a1`: The first integer from the next input line.
   - `l1`: A list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1 >= idx2`; otherwise, `l1` remains unchanged.
   - `a2`: The first integer from the new input line.
   - `l2`: A list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`.
   - `l11`: A list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`).
   - `l22`: A list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
   - `l11` is not equal to `l22`.
   - `idx1`: Either -1 or `n - 2`.
   - `idx2`: Not -1.
   - `p1` and `p2`: Both initialized to 0.
   - The loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration).
   - `val`: Contains `m - 2` elements if `idx1 < idx2`, or `m - 1` elements if `idx1 > idx2`. Each element is a tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
   - `a3`: The next integer from the input.
   - `l3`: The list of remaining integers from the input with `a3` removed. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

2. **Code Context:**
   - The `print('no')` statement is executed after a series of operations involving loops and conditions.
   - The specific conditions under which this print statement is reached are not explicitly detailed, but it is clear that the program has gone through several iterations and checks without finding a match or satisfying a certain condition.

### Analysis:
Given the context, the `print('no')` statement is likely executed when none of the conditions required to print something else (such as 'yes' or any other value) are met. This implies that after processing all inputs and performing the necessary checks, the program concludes that the desired condition (which would lead to a different print statement) is not satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The `print('no')` statement outputs the string 'no' directly.

Output: **no**
