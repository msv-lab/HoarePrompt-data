The code snippet assigns new values to `n` and `m` based on the input. The initial state of `_` and `t` are not affected by this code. The initial state specifies that `_` is `n - 1` and `t` is such that `n` is less than `t`. After the execution of the code, `n` and `m` will hold the values provided by the user input.

Output State: **`_` is `n - 1`, `t` is such that `n` is less than `t`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
