The given code snippet consists of an `input()` function call without assigning its result to any variable. This means that the input is being read but not stored or used further in the code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- The current value of `m` is 1.

Since the `input()` function is called but its result is not assigned to any variable, the values of `n`, `m`, and `t` remain unchanged. The input operation does not affect the existing variables unless the result is stored.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except that an input operation has occurred, which does not change the values of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; the current value of `m` is 1.**
