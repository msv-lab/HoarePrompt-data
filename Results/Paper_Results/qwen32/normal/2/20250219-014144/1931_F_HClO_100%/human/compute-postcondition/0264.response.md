The code snippet `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a2` and the rest to the list `l2`. 

Given the initial state, `a2` and `l2` are the only variables that will be affected by this code snippet. All other variables remain unchanged.

Let's assume the input provided is `12 13 14 15`. This means:
- `a2` will be assigned the value `12`.
- `l2` will be assigned the list `[13, 14, 15]`.

Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 14, 15], `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged, `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`, `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration and `x + 1 < t`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` are the values read from the input; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx1 <= idx2`.**
