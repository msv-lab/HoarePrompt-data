Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 14, 15], `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15], `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`, `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the value read from the input, `i` is `k + 2`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `idx1` is `k + 2`, `idx2` is `k + 2`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Natural Language Explanation: The code contains a `break` statement, which causes the most internal loop or if statement to be exited. No other variables are modified by this statement, so their values remain the same as described in the initial state.
