Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 14, 15], `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s, `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15], `val` is `[(4, [5, 6, 7]), (8, [9, 10, 11])]`, `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is the values read from the input, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. No other variables are modified, so their values remain as they were initially described.
