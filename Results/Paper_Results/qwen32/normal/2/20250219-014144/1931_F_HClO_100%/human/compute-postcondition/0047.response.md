Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 5, `m` is an integer read from the input (and must be at least 3 if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`), `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` is set to `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `idx1` and `idx2`. `i` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.`**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The variable `i` is still 4.
