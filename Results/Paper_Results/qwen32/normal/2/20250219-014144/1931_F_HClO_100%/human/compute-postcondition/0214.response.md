The code snippet `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the element `a1` into the list `l1` at the index specified by `idx2`. Given that `idx2` is initially `-1` but is updated to `n - 2` if `idx1` is not `-1`, and since `idx1` is not `-1`, `idx2` is `n - 2`.

After the insertion, the list `l1` will have `a1` inserted at the position `n - 2`. This means that all elements from index `n - 2` onwards will be shifted one position to the right.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `l1` will have `a1` inserted at index `n - 2`.
- `idx2` is now `n - 2`.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `idx1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` is not `-1`; `idx2` is `n - 2`; `p1` and `p2` are either `0` or `1` depending on whether `a2` or `a1` was encountered in `l1` or `l2` respectively; `val` is an empty list; `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `n - 2`.**
