Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l1` has `a1` inserted at the position `idx2` and `l` is the same as `l1`. Otherwise, `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1` and `l` is equal to `l2`.**
