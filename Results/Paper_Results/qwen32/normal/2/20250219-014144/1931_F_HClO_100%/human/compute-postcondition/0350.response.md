The code snippet `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` at the position `idx2` in the list `l1`.

Given the initial state, `l1` is a list of integers excluding any 12s, and `a1` is the first integer from the input. `idx2` is determined based on certain conditions, but its exact value isn't specified in the initial state. However, we know that `idx2` is a valid index in `l1` or could be the end of the list if it's set to `n - 2` under specific conditions.

After executing the code, `l1` will have `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input with `a1` inserted at `idx2`, `a2` is 12, `l2` is [13, 14, 15], `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any 12s (prior to the insertion), `l22` is [13, 14, 15] excluding `a1` if `a1` is in [13, 14, 15], `val` is [], `_` is `x + (m - 2)` where `x` is the initial value of `_` and `x + (m - 2) < t` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `_` remains unchanged, `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`, `n` is the value read from the input, `m` is the value read from the input, `i` is `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` are determined by the comparisons made during the iterations, `idx1` is `n - 2` if `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1`, otherwise `idx1` remains -1, and `idx2` is `n - 2` if `idx2 == -1 and idx1 != -1`. Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If `m` is 2, then `_` is updated to `x + (m - 2)` if `l11` is not equal to `l22`. `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input. In addition, the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
