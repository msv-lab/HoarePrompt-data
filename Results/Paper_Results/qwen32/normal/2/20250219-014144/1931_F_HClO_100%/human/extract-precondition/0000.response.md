Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. For each test case, there are k lines containing n distinct integers each, where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive. All the authors of the screenshots (the first integer in each of the k lines) are different.**
