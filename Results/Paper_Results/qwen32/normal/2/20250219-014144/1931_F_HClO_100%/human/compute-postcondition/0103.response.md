The value of `m` is decremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `a3`, `l3`, and `val` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, with `m` now being `m - 1`; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `val` contains an additional element `(a3, l3)`**
