The given code snippet inserts the integer `a2` into the list `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`. This operation modifies the list `l2` by adding one element at the specified index, shifting all subsequent elements one position to the right.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input
- `a3` is the first integer from the new input line
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line
- The index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`

The code snippet does not affect `t`, `n`, `m`, `a3`, or `l3`. It only affects `l2` by inserting `a2` at `idx1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1`; the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.**

In simpler terms, the list `l2` now includes `a2` at the specified index `idx1`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
