The given Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `val`. None of the other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`) are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same for all other variables except for the newly introduced `val` list, which is now an empty list.

Output State: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`; `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`; `n` and `m` remain unchanged; `a1` and `a2` remain unchanged; `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged; `l11` and `l22` remain unchanged; `idx1` and `idx2` are either `-1` or the index `i` where `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` was met; `p1` and `p2` are either `0` or `1` depending on whether `a2` or `a1` was encountered in `l1` or `l2` respectively; `val` is an empty list.**
