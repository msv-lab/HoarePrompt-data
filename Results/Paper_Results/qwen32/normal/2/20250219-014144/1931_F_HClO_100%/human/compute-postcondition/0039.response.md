Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer read from the input (and must be at least 3 if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`), `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the variable `p2` is now assigned the value 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
