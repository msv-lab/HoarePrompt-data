The code snippet `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` at the position `idx2` in the list `l1`. This means that the element currently at index `idx2` and all subsequent elements in `l1` will be shifted one position to the right.

Given the initial state, `l1` is a list of integers, `a1` is an integer, and `idx2` is a valid index in `l1` (since `idx2` is not -1). After the insertion, `l1` will have one more element, and its length will increase by 1.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the `insert` operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the next input line; `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`); `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 2`; `idx2` is not -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration); `val` is an empty list; `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**
