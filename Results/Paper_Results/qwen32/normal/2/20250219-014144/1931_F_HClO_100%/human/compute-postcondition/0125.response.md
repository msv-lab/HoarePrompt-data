The only objects in the loop head are `a3` and `l3`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `val` list. The loop iterates over each tuple `(a3, l3)` in the `val` list. At the end of the last iteration, `val` contains `m - 2` elements if `idx1 < idx2`, or `m - 1` elements if `idx1 > idx2`. Each element being a tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.

To execute one more time, there must be another tuple `(a3, l3)` in the `val` list. Since the loop has already completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration), we need to consider the state of `val` before the current iteration.

Given that `val` contains `m - 2` or `m - 1` elements and the loop is about to start its next iteration, it means that the current tuple `(a3, l3)` has just been processed, and we need to set the next tuple `(a3, l3)` for the next iteration.

Since the exact contents of `val` are not specified beyond its length, we assume that there is one more tuple available for processing. Therefore, we need to adjust `a3` and `l3` to represent the next tuple in `val`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is at least 3, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the next input line, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if `idx1 >= idx2`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a2` inserted at index `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2` (before the insertion of `a1`), `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `idx1` is either -1 or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, the loop has completed all `n - 1` iterations without setting `idx1` to a non-negative value (except possibly in the last iteration), `val` contains `m - 2` elements if `idx1 < idx2`, or `m - 1` elements if `idx1 > idx2`, each element being a tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `a3` is the next integer from the input, `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the input with `a3` removed. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

For the next iteration, we assume `val` still has one more tuple `(a3, l3)`:
