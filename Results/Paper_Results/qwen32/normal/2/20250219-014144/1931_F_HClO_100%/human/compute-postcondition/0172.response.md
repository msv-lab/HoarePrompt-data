Postcondition: **`_` is `n - 1` if `l11` equals `l22`, otherwise `_` is `n + m - 2`. `t` is such that `_` (either `n - 1` or `n + m - 2`) is less than `t`. `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1. `m` is the second integer from the input. `a1` is the first integer from the new input line. `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line. `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line. `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input line. `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding any elements that are equal to `a2`. `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding any elements that are equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement breaks. Otherwise, if `idx1` is non-negative and `idx2` is non-negative, the most internal loop or if statement breaks. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as per the precondition.**
