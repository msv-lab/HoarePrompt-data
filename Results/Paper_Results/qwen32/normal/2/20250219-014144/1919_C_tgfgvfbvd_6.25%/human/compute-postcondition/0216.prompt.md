Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), representing the size of the array a. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), which are the elements of the array a. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = l[0]
    b = 0
    c = 0
    y = 0
    for y in range(1, n):
        if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
            b = l[y]
            break
    for x in range(y + 1, n):
        if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
            if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
            c += 1
        elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
            if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
        elif a >= l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `a` is the smallest element in `l[y+1:n]` that meets the loop's conditions, `b` is the largest element in `l[y+1:n]` that meets the loop's conditions, `c` is the count of elements in `l[y+1:n]` that are greater than both `a` and `b` at the time they are encountered.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is the smallest element in `l`, `b` is the second smallest element in `l` (or the same as `a` if no distinct second smallest element exists), `c` is the count of elements greater than both `a` and `b`, `n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is the minimum value in `l[y + 1:n]`, `b` is the maximum value in `l[y + 1:n]`, and `c` is the count of elements greater than both `a` and `b` encountered during the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
