The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The values of `y`, `n`, `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Output State: **`y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. If the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`. `c` is incremented by 1.**
