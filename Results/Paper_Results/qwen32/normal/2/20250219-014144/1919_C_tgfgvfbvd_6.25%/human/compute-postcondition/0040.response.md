Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is `l[x]`, `c` is 0, `y` must be less than `n-1`, and `l[x]` is less than `a`. Additionally, either `l[x]` is not less than `b` or `b` is 0.**

In simple terms: The value of `b` has been updated to `l[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
