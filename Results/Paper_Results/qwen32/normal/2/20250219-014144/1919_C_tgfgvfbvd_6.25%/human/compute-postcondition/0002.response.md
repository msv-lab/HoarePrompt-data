The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was already initialized with an integer value from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `l` is a list of integers read from the second line of input.**
