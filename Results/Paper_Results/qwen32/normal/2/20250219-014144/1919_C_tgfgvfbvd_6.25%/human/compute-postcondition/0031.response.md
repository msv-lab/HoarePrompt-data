Postcondition: **`n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than the previous one or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` must be less than `n-1`, and `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`. Additionally, the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`.**
