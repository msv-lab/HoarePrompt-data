To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

Initial State: `y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `x` is `y + 2`.

Code Snippet:
```python
a = l[x]
```

Here, `a` is assigned the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l`. The value of `x` is `y + 2`. 

Since the value of `l[x]` depends on the content of the list `l` which is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. However, we know that `a` will take the value of the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`.

The other variables (`y`, `n`, `x`) remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`y` is any integer, `n` is greater than `y + 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `a` is `l[y + 2]`**.
