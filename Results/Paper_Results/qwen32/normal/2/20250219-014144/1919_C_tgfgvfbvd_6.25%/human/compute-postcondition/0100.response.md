Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `y` is 0, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `c` is 1, and `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. If `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, then `a` is `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is `l[x]`.**

Explanation: The value of `c` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
