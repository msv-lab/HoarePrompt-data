Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `l` is the list of integers read from the input, `a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x]`, `b` is either the first `l[y]` that is greater than `l[y-1]` or `l[x]`, `c` is 0, and `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`. If `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `a` becomes `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` becomes `l[x]`.**
