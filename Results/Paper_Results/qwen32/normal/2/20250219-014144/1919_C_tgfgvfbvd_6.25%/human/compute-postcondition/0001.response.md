Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The precondition that `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2⋅10^5 remains valid after the code execution. No other variables are affected.
