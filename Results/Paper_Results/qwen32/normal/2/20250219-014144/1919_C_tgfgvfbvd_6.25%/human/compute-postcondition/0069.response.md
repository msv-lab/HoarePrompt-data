Postcondition: **`n`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged. `x` is `y + 3`. If `l[y + 3] > a` and `l[y + 3] > b`, then `c` is incremented by 1, and either `a` is set to `l[y + 3]` if `l[y + 3] - a >= l[y + 3] - b`, or `b` is set to `l[y + 3]` otherwise. If `l[y + 3]` is not greater than both `a` and `b`, then if `l[y + 3] < a` and `l[y + 3] < b`, `a` is set to `l[y + 3]` if `a - l[y + 3] <= b - l[y + 3]`, or `b` is set to `l[y + 3]` otherwise. If `l[y + 3]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 3]` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[y + 3]`, or `b` is set to `l[y + 3]` otherwise.**
