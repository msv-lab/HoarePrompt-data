Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: `n`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged. `x` is `y + 3`.

Code Snippet:
```python
b = l[x]
```

The code assigns the value of `l[x]` to the variable `b`. Since `x` is defined as `y + 3`, the value of `b` will be the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`.

Output State: **`n`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged; `x` is `y + 3`; `b` is `l[y + 3]`.**

This means that `n`, `l`, and `y` retain their original values, `x` is calculated as `y + 3`, and `b` is assigned the value of the element at index `y + 3` in the list `l`.
