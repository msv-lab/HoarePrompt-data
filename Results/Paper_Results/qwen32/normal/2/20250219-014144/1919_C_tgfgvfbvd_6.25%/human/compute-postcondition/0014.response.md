The code provided is simply a `break` statement, which does not alter the values of any variables. It only affects the control flow by exiting the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Given that there are no changes to the variables `n`, `y`, or `b`, the preconditions remain valid as stated.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `y + 2`; `y` is `y + 1`; `b` is `l[y]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `n`, `y`, and `b` remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than `y + 2` is still valid, `y` has been incremented by 1, and `b` retains its value from the list `l` at the index `y`. The `break` statement exits the current loop or switch block without modifying these variables.
