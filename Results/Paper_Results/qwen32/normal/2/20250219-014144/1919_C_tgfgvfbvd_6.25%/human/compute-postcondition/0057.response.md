The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `x` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` was set to `y + 2`. For the next iteration, `x` should be incremented by 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was `y + 2`.
2. The loop condition is `x in range(y + 1, n)`, meaning the loop will execute as long as `x` is less than `n`.
3. To proceed to the next iteration, `x` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be `y + 3`.

State: **`n`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged. `x` is `y + 3`.**
