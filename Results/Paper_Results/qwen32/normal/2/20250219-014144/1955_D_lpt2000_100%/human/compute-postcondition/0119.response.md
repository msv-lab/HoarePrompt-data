Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and m < n; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is 1; `aa` is a list of `n` strings (each string is a representation of the integers originally in `a`); `bb` is a list of strings read from the input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, the count of `in_aa` in `D` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. `fnd` is 2 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ `k` else 1; `in_aa` is the next element of `aa[m:]` to be processed by the loop; `out_aa` is the next element of `aa[:n - m]` to be processed by the loop.**
