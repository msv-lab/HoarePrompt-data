The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, and `k` are already defined integers within certain ranges, but the code overwrites these values with new inputs.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is 1**. 

In natural language, the value of `t` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the input, maintaining the condition that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5. The lists `a` and `b`, and the variable `nabors` remain unchanged.
