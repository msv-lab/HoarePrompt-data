Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is 1; `aa` is a list of strings read from the input; `bb` is a list of strings read from the next line of input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet creates a new Counter object `cnt_bb` that counts the occurrences of each string in the list `bb`. All other variables retain their initial values.
