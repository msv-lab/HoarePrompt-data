Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `m < n`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `nabors` is 1; `aa` is a list of strings; `bb` is a list of strings; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements in `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `C` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` ≥ `k` else 0; `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0; `E[out_aa]` is 0**
