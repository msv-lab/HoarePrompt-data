The code snippet constructs a string `result` by joining the `char` elements from each tuple in the `details` list. Since `details` is a list of tuples sorted by `-i` and then by `char`, the order of characters in `result` will reflect this sorting.

Given that `balance` is 0 and `details` is a list of tuples `(balance, -i, char)`, the value of `balance` does not affect the construction of `result`. The variable `result` will be a string composed of the `char` elements from the `details` list in their sorted order.

Output State: **`balance` is 0; `details` is a list of tuples `(balance, -i, char)` sorted by `-i` and then by `char`; `result` is a string formed by concatenating the `char` elements from `details` in their sorted order.**
