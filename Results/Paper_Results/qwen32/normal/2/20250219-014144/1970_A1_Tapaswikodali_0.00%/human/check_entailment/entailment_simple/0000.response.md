### Reasoning:

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the input string `s`, which is a balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Balance Calculation**: It then iterates through each character in the string, maintaining a running balance (`balance`) that increases by 1 for each opening parenthesis `(` and decreases by 1 for each closing parenthesis `)`. 

3. **Storing Details**: For each character, it stores a tuple containing the current balance, the negative index of the character (to ensure sorting by decreasing position when balances are equal), and the character itself in the list `details`.

4. **Sorting**: The list `details` is sorted primarily by the balance (in ascending order) and secondarily by the negative index (which ensures that in case of ties in balance, the character with the higher original position comes first).

5. **Generating Result**: Finally, the program constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted list `details`.

6. **Output**: The resulting string is printed, which represents the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

The program correctly handles the sorting criteria specified in the problem statement and ensures that the output sequence maintains the properties of a balanced parentheses sequence.

### Conclusion:

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
