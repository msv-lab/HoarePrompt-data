Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `details` is an empty list. If the current character `char` is "(", then `balance` is 2. Otherwise, if `char` is ")", then `balance` is -1.**
