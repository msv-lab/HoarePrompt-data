Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `balance` is initialized to 0.
2. `details` is a list of tuples `(balance, -i, char)`, sorted by `-i` and then by `char`.
3. `result` is a string formed by concatenating the `char` elements from `details` in their sorted order.

### Analysis:
- Since `balance` is 0, each tuple in `details` will start with 0.
- The sorting criteria for `details` are `-i` and then `char`. This means that tuples with larger `-i` values (or smaller `i` values) come first. If two tuples have the same `-i` value, they are sorted by `char`.
- `result` is constructed by concatenating the `char` elements from the sorted `details` list.

### Example Scenario:
To illustrate, let's assume the following `details` list after sorting:
```python
details = [(0, -3, 'c'), (0, -2, 'a'), (0, -2, 'b'), (0, -1, 'd')]
```
Here, the tuples are sorted by `-i` first and then by `char`:
- Tuples with `-i = -3` come first.
- Tuples with `-i = -2` come next, and within this group, 'a' comes before 'b'.
- Tuples with `-i = -1` come last.

### Construction of `result`:
The `result` string is formed by concatenating the `char` elements from the sorted `details` list:
```python
result = 'c' + 'a' + 'b' + 'd'
result = 'cabd'
```

### General Case:
Without knowing the exact contents of `details`, we can still describe the output precisely. The `result` string will be the concatenation of the `char` elements from the `details` list, sorted by `-i` and then by `char`.

### Final Output:
Based on the given initial state and the construction of `result`, the output will be the concatenated string of `char` elements from the sorted `details` list.

Output: **result (where result is the concatenation of the `char` elements from the `details` list, sorted by `-i` and then by `char`)**
