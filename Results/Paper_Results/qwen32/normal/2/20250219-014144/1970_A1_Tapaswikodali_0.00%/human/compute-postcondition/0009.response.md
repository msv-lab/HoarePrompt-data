The code appends a tuple to the `details` list, where the tuple contains the `balance`, `-i`, and `char`. Given the initial state, `details` was an empty list. After executing the code, `details` will contain one tuple with the specified values.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `details` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, -i, char)`; `balance` is 2 if `char` is "(", otherwise `balance` is -1.**

In simpler terms, `details` now includes one entry with the current balance, the negative index `i`, and the character `char`. All other conditions about `s` remain unchanged.
