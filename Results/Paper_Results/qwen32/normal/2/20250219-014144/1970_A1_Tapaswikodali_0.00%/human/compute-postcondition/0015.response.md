To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `char`.

Given:
- `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.
- `details` is a list containing tuples, the last of which is `(balance, -i, char)`.

From the loop statement:
```
for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know that `enumerate(s)` will provide us with the next index `i` and the character `char` at that index in the string `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` remains unchanged as it is the input string.
- `details` contains tuples, but we only care about the loop variables `i` and `char`.

Since `enumerate(s)` automatically increments `i` and fetches the corresponding `char` from `s`, we need to adjust `i` to the next index and `char` to the character at that index.

Let's break down the steps:
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `k`.
2. The next value of `i` should be `k + 1`.
3. `char` should be `s[k + 1]`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `char` is the character at the new index `i`.

Given that the last tuple in `details` was `(balance, -i, char)`, we can infer that the current `i` was the index of the last processed character. Therefore, the next `i` should be `i + 1` and `char` should be `s[i + 1]`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `details` is a list containing tuples, the last of which is `(balance, -i, char)`; `i` is incremented by 1; `char` is `s[i + 1]`.**

However, since we cannot directly express `s[i + 1]` without knowing the exact string `s`, we can simply state that `i` is incremented by 1 and `char` is the next character in the string `s`.

Final State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `details` is a list containing tuples, the last of which is `(balance, -i, char)`; `i` is incremented by 1; `char` is the next character in the string `s`.**

Simplified Final State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `char` is the next character in the string `s`.**

So the final answer is:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `char` is the next character in the string `s`.**
