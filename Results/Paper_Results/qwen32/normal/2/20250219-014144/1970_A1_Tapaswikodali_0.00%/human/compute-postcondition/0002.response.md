The given code initializes an empty list named `details`. No changes are made to the variables `s` and `balance`. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the new list `details`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `balance` is 0; `details` is an empty list.**
