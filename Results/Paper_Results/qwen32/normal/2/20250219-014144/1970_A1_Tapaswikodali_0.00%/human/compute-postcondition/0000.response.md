The code snippet `s = input()` reads a new value from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. Given the initial state, `s` was already defined as a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence. After executing the code, `s` will be updated to whatever new input string is provided, which must also satisfy the same conditions (a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence).

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.**
