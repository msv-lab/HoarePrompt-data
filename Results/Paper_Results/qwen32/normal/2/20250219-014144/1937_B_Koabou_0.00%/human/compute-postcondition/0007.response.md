The code appends a new binary string to the list `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` already contains two binary strings: the original one of length `n` and a newly appended binary string. After executing the code, the list `a` will now contain three binary strings: the original one, the previously appended one, and the new binary string provided by the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing three binary strings, where the first binary string is the original one of length `n`, the second binary string is the first newly appended binary string, and the third binary string is the second newly appended binary string from the input; `_` is 1**.
