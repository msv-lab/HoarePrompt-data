Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list containing two binary strings each of length `n`. If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', then `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]`, `x` is set to the incremented value of `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
