Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `s` is defined as `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`.
   - This means `s` is the sum of the first element of list `a` and the last element of the second element of list `a` (which is assumed to be a list itself).
   
2. `x` is defined as `n - 1`.
   - This means `x` is one less than the value of `n`.

3. `t` is defined as `1`.
   - This means `t` has a fixed value of `1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(t)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement only involves the variable `t`.
- From the initial state, we know that `t` is explicitly set to `1`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `t`, which is `1`.

Output: **1**
