To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the provided code and understand its behavior. Here's the loop code again for reference:

```python
for _ in range(2):
    a.append(input())
```

This loop runs exactly 2 times because the range is set to 2. During each iteration, it appends a new binary string (obtained via `input()`) to the list `a`. Given that the loop runs exactly 2 times, we can deduce the following:

- Initially, `a` is an empty list.
- After the first iteration, `a` contains one binary string.
- After the second iteration, `a` contains two binary strings.

Since the loop runs exactly 2 times, there is no third iteration. Therefore, the final state of `a` will be a list containing exactly two binary strings.

**Output State:** `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two binary strings, where the first binary string is the first binary string of length `n` obtained from the input, and the second binary string is the second binary string of length `n` obtained from the input.

Using the required format:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list containing two binary strings, where the first binary string is the first binary string of length `n` obtained from the input, and the second binary string is the second binary string of length `n` obtained from the input.**
