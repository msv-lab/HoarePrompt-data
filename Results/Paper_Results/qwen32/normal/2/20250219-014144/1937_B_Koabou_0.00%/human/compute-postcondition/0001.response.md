Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by two binary strings of length n representing the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is an empty list; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input from the user, which represents the length of the binary strings in each test case. The other conditions and the empty list `a` remain unchanged.
