The value of `x` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list containing two binary strings each of length `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the concatenation of `a[0][:i + 1]` and `a[1][i:]`, `x` is the value of `i`.**
