You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is

- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a new string `s` based on specific conditions involving the two binary strings and prints `s` followed by an integer `t`. The construction of `s` involves combining parts of the two binary strings under certain conditions, and `t` is determined based on the overlap between the initial part of `s` and the first binary string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem requirements step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: We need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by traversing from the top-left corner (1,1) to the bottom-right corner (2,n) in a 2xN grid, moving only right or down. Additionally, we need to count the number of such paths that result in this smallest string.

2. **Constraints**:
   - The grid is 2 rows by N columns.
   - Each cell contains either a 0 or a 1.
   - The grasshopper starts at (1,1) and can move right or down.
   - We need to consider the binary string formed by the path taken.

3. **Approach**:
   - The key is to identify the lexicographically smallest path.
   - Since the grasshopper can only move right or down, the path will consist of a sequence of 'R' (right) and 'D' (down) moves.
   - The smallest string will be determined by the values in the cells visited along the path.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
    else:
        s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
        x = n - 1
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
    print(s, sep='')
    print(t)
```

#### Issues in the Code

1. **Logic for Finding the Smallest String**:
   - The code attempts to find a point where it can switch from the top row to the bottom row to minimize the string.
   - However, the logic `if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':` is flawed because it doesn't guarantee the smallest string. For example, it might skip better opportunities to switch rows earlier or later.
   - The code also doesn't handle cases where the smallest string can be achieved by staying in the top row or bottom row entirely.

2. **Counting the Number of Paths**:
   - The logic for counting the number of paths that yield the smallest string is incorrect.
   - The variable `t` is set to `x - i + 1`, which doesn't accurately represent the number of paths leading to the smallest string.

### Correctness

Given the above issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. It fails to ensure that the lexicographically smallest string is found and incorrectly counts the number of paths that yield this string.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
