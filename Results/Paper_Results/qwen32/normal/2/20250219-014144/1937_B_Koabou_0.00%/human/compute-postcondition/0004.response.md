In this case, the loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the range `(2)`. This means that the loop will iterate exactly twice, and the underscore `_` does not represent any variable that needs to be adjusted between iterations.

Since the loop runs for a fixed number of iterations (2 times), there are no variables in the loop head that change or need adjustment based on the previous iteration's state. The loop counter is internal to the `range` function and does not affect the program state outside the loop.

Given that the loop will run exactly two times regardless of the values of `n` and `a`, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except for the implicit iteration count which is managed by the `range` function.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list containing one binary string of length `n`**.
