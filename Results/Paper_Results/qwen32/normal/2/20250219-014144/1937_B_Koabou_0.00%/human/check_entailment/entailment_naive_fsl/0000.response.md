Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for finding the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Path Selection**:
   - The program incorrectly selects the path based on the condition `if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`. This condition is too restrictive and does not always lead to the lexicographically smallest path.
   - For example, consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     3
     010
     001
     ```
     The lexicographically smallest path should be `000`, but the program might choose a different path due to its condition.

2. **Handling of Equal Paths**:
   - The program does not correctly count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - Specifically, the loop `for i in range(x):` and the condition `if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:` do not correctly account for all possible paths that could produce the smallest string.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the entire path is composed of the same character (all `0`s or all `1`s).
   - For example:
     ```
     1
     5
     00000
     00000
     ```
     The correct output should be `00000` and `8` (since there are 8 ways to reach the end), but the program might not handle this correctly.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Traverse both rows simultaneously, always choosing the lexicographically smaller character.
- Use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to reach each cell while maintaining the lexicographically smallest path.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a1 = input()
    a2 = input()
    
    # Initialize the smallest path and count
    smallest_path = []
    count_paths = [0] * (n + 1)
    count_paths[0] = 1
    
    for i in range(n):
        if a1[i] < a2[i]:
            smallest_path.append(a1[i])
            count_paths[i + 1] = count_paths[i]
        elif a1[i] > a2[i]:
            smallest_path.append(a2[i])
            count_paths[i + 1] = count_paths[i]
        else:
            smallest_path.append(a1[i])
            count_paths[i + 1] = count_paths[i] + count_paths[i - 1] if i > 0 else 1
    
    print(''.join(smallest_path))
    print(count_paths[n])
```

This corrected program ensures that we always take the lexicographically smallest path and correctly counts the number of such paths.
