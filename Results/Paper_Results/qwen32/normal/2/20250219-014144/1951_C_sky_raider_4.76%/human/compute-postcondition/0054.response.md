The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - 2 * s`, `c` is updated to `c + l[0] * s - s * s / 2 + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `l` remains unchanged, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k - s`**
