The code snippet modifies the variable `c` by adding a calculated value to it. The value added is `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. The variables `i`, `s`, and `k` are also part of the initial state and are used in the calculation, but their values are not altered directly by this line of code.

Here's the breakdown:
- `c` is updated to include the new value `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, so its value remains as `i + 1` (though it's not modified in this line).
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` and is used in the calculation but not modified.
- `k` is adjusted to `k - s` in the initial state, so its value remains as `k - s`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` is `k - s`, `c` is updated to `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.**
