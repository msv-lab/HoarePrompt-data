The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a specific string `'##..'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `casos`, `n`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 20.
- `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20.
- `n` is an integer with a current value of 2.

However, none of these variables are used within the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'##..'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **##..**
