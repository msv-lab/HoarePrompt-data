Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20, `n` is an input integer, and `c` is `c + 1`, ensuring `c < casos`. If `n` equals 2, the specific behavior of the if part does not change the values of `t`, `casos`, `n`, and `c` other than incrementing `c` by 1. Otherwise, whether `n` equals 3 or not, `c` is incremented by 1 and remains less than `casos`.**
