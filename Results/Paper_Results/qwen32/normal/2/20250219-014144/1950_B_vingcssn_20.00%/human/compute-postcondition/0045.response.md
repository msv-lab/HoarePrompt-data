The given initial state describes several variables (`t`, `casos`, `n`, `c`) and their constraints, but the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'##..##'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variables and Constraints**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 20 inclusive.
   - `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 inclusive.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `c < casos`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('##..##')`.
   - This statement directly outputs the string `'##..##'` without referencing any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `casos`, `n`, or `c`, the output will always be the same string regardless of the values of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **##..##**
