The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a specific string regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `casos`, `n`, and `c`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `c < casos`.

However, none of these variables are used within the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'##..##..'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **##..##..**
