Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `casos` is an integer such that \(1 \leq casos \leq 20\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring \(c < casos\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('##..##..')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `casos`, `n`, or `c`. It simply prints the string `'##..##..'`.

### Output:
Based on the analysis, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **##..##..**
