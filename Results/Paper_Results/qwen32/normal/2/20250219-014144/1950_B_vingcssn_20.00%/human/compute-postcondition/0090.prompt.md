Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(0, casos):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('##')
        print('##')
    elif n == 2:
        print('##..')
        print('##..')
        print('..##')
        print('..##')
    elif n == 3:
        print('##..##')
        print('##..##')
        print('..##..')
        print('..##..')
        print('##..##')
        print('##..##')
    elif n == 4:
        print('##..##..')
        print('##..##..')
        print('..##..##')
        print('..##..##')
        print('##..##..')
        print('##..##..')
        print('..##..##')
        print('..##..##')
    else:
        print('No esta en el rango')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, then the current value of `n` remains 1. If `n` is 2, then the current value of `n` remains 2. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 or 2, which means `n` can be any integer other than 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20, `n` is an input integer, and `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `c < casos`. If `n` equals 1, no additional changes occur. If `n` equals 2 or 3, no additional changes occur. For any other value of `n`, `c` is incremented by 1 again.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20, `n` is an input integer, and `c` is `c + 1`, ensuring `c < casos`. If `n` equals 1, the behavior of the if part does not change the values of `t`, `casos`, `n`, and `c` other than incrementing `c` by 1. If `n` equals 2, the behavior of the else part does not change the values of `t`, `casos`, `n`, and `c` other than incrementing `c` by 1. For any other value of `n`, `c` is incremented by 1 and remains less than `casos`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
