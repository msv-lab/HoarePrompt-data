Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.
- `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `c < casos`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('##..##')
```

From the initial state, we can see that none of the variables `t`, `casos`, `n`, or `c` are used within the print statement. The print statement directly outputs the string `'##..##'`.

Therefore, the output will be exactly the string `'##..##'`.

Output: **##..##**
