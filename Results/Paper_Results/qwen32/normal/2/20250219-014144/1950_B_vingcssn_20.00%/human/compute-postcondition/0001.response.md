To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `c` and `casos`.

Given the for loop:
```python
for c in range(0, casos):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `casos` is greater than 0 because `range(0, casos)` generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `casos`. If `casos` is 0 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

The variable `c` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The variable `casos` must be adjusted to ensure that it is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20
- `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20

Since `casos` is already constrained to be between 1 and 20, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `casos` in this specific context. However, to strictly adhere to the requirement of adjusting only the objects in the loop head and ensuring the loop can execute, we can confirm that `casos` should be at least 1.

Thus, the state remains as given, with the confirmation that `casos` is within the required range for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20**
