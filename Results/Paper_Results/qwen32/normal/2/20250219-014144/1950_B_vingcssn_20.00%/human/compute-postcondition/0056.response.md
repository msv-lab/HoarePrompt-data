The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('..##..##')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'..##..##'`. There are no variables or conditions that affect the content of this string. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `casos`, `n`, and `c`, but none of these variables are used within the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string specified in the `print` function.

Output: **..##..##**
