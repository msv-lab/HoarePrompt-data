The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'##'`. This string is explicitly defined within the `print` function and does not depend on any variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:

- The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `casos`, and `n`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'##'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not change based on the values of `t`, `casos`, or `n`.

Output: **##**
