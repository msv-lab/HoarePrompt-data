The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs a specific string regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `casos`, and `n`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 20.
- `casos` is an integer between 1 and 20.
- `n` is an integer that is not 1, 2, or 3, and currently has a value of 4.

However, none of these variables are used within the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'..##..##'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'..##..##'`.

Output: **..##..##**
