Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is an integer such that 1 ≤ casos ≤ 20, `n` is an input integer, and `c` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `c < casos`. Regardless of whether `n` equals 4 or not, `c` is incremented by 1.**
