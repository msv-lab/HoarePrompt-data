The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'##..##'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `casos`, `n`, or `c` mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `casos`, `n`, and `c`) but none of these variables are used within the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'##..##'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'##..##'`.

Output: **##..##**
