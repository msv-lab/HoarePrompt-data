The value of `h` is incremented by the value of `curr`. Given that `curr` is initially set to `n // k`, the new value of `h` will be `n // k`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is `n // k`; `curr` is `n // k`.**
