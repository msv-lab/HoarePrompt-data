Given the initial state:

- `n` is 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `costs` is a list containing \([n - k + 1, 1]\), which simplifies to \([-k + 1, 1]\).
- `h` is \(n // (n - k + 1) + n\), which simplifies to \(0 // (-k + 1) + 0 = 0\).
- `curr` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `h` is less than `k`.

The Python code snippet provided is:

```python
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. None of the variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `h`, `curr`, `i`) affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
