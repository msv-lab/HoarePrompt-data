### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Objective**: Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - Number of stalls `s` must be â‰¤ 60.
   - Each stall's price `p_i` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
   - Alice buys greedily: she buys as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then moves to the next stall, and so on.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` (Alice's coins) and `k` (desired number of jewels).
- The function `func_1(n, k)` is called for each test case.
- Inside `func_1`:
  - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", sets up one stall with price 1, and returns.
  - If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels with fewer coins.
  - If `n >= k`, it initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]` and calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from these stalls.
  - It sums up the number of jewels Alice can buy (`h`) and checks if `h >= k`.
  - If `h < k`, it prints "NO".
  - If `h >= k`, it prints "YES" and the prices in `costs`.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Setting Up Stalls**:
   - The program only considers two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - This approach is too simplistic and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - For example, consider `n = 255` and `k = 8`. The program sets up stalls with prices `[248, 1]`, but this does not ensure Alice buys exactly 8 jewels.
   
2. **Not Utilizing the Full Potential of 60 Stalls**:
   - The problem allows up to 60 stalls, but the program only uses 2.
   - A more effective strategy would be to use binary representation or a similar greedy approach to distribute the prices across multiple stalls.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The logic for handling cases where `n == k` and `n < k` is correct.
   - However, the general case (`n > k`) is not handled correctly due to the limited number of stalls and their prices.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic and the constraints of the problem, the provided program is **incorrect**. It does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels for all possible values of `n` and `k`.

**Correctness: False**
