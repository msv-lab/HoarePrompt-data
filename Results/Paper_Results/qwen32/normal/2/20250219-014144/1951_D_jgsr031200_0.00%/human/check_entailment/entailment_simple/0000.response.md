### Reasoning:

The provided program is supposed to determine whether Bob can set up his jewelry store with at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. The logic in the current implementation seems flawed and does not correctly address the problem requirements. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Base Case Handling**:
   - When `n == k`, the program correctly prints "YES", sets up one stall with a price of 1, and Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This part is correct.

2. **Case When `n < k`**:
   - When `n < k`, the program correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than the number of jewels she wants to buy. This part is also correct.

3. **General Case (`n > k`)**:
   - The program initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then iterates over these costs to calculate how many jewels Alice can buy.
   - However, the logic inside the loop is incorrect. It calculates `curr = n // i` and updates `h` and `n` accordingly. But this approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - The condition `if (h < k)` checks if the total number of jewels Alice can buy is less than `k`. If true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the costs.
   - The costs `[n - k + 1, 1]` are not necessarily optimal or correct for ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program should output the number of stalls `s` and the prices `p1, p2, ..., ps` such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The current implementation does not ensure this.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the general case (`n > k`) and does not provide a valid solution for setting up the stalls and their prices. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
