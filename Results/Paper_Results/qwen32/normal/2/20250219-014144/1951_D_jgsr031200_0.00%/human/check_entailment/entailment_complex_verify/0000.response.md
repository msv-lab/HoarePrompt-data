### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using at most `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from stall 1 to stall 60, buying as many jewels as possible at each stall.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function Definition Issue**:
   - The program calls `func_1(n, k)` but does not define it. This would indeed lead to a `NameError` if executed. However, since the annotations assume the function is defined, we'll proceed with analyzing the function's logic.

2. **Logic for Determining Stall Prices**:
   - The function initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]` and iterates over these costs to calculate how many jewels Alice can buy.
   - The variable `h` accumulates the total number of jewels Alice can buy, and `n` is reduced accordingly.
   - The function checks if `h < k` and prints "NO" if true; otherwise, it prints "YES" along with the costs.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n < k` by printing "NO".
   - The function also handles the case where `n == k` by printing "YES" with a single stall priced at 1 coin.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The output format is mixed up in the provided code. For example, when printing "YES", the number of stalls and their prices are not on separate lines.

#### Annotations Analysis:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call.
- The annotations highlight that the function attempts to determine if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels using the prices in `costs`.
- The annotations also note that the final state of `h` and `n` after processing the costs does not guarantee that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Issue with Cost Calculation**:
  - The current implementation uses only two prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`). This is insufficient to guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels for arbitrary values of `n` and `k`.
  - For example, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the function will not correctly determine the prices to ensure Alice buys exactly 8 jewels.

- **Insufficient Number of Stalls**:
  - The function does not attempt to use more than two stalls, which is often necessary to achieve the exact number of jewels `k`.

- **Output Format**:
  - The output format is incorrect as mentioned earlier. The number of stalls and their prices should be printed on separate lines.

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach involves setting up stalls with decreasing prices starting from 1 and doubling each time (or another strategy that ensures the total number of jewels bought equals `k`). Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print("NO")
        continue
    if n == k:
        print("YES")
        print(1)
        print(1)
        continue
    
    stalls = []
    remaining_jewels = k
    remaining_coins = n
    
    # Start with the highest possible price and decrease
    price = 1
    while remaining_jewels > 0:
        if remaining_coins >= price:
            max_jewels = remaining_coins // price
            if max_jewels >= remaining_jewels:
                stalls.append(price * remaining_jewels)
                break
            else:
                stalls.append(price * max_jewels)
                remaining_jewels -= max_jewels
                remaining_coins -= price * max_jewels
        price *= 2
    
    if len(stalls) > 60:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(len(stalls))
        print(" ".join(map(str, stalls)))
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to insufficient logic for determining stall prices and improper handling of the number of stalls.

**Final:** **False**
