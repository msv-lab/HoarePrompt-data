The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `costs`. Therefore, we can only adjust these for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in costs:
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value of the last element in `costs`. The list `costs` contains two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. 

If `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, then the loop has already iterated over all elements in `costs` and should terminate. However, if we assume that the loop has just started or is about to start its first iteration, `i` would be `n - k + 1`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` should take the value of the next element in `costs`. Since `costs` has only two elements, if `i` was `n - k + 1` during the previous iteration, it should now be `1` for the next (and final) iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` should be `1` (the next element in `costs`).
- `costs` remains unchanged as it is the iterable in the loop.

State: **`n` is `n - i * (n // k)`, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\), `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // k`, `curr` is `n // k`, `i` is `1`**
