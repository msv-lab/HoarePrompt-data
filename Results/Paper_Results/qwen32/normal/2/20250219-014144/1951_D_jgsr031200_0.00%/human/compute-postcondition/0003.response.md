Given the initial state where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and currently, `n` is equal to `k`, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print(1)` statement.

The `print(1)` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1**
