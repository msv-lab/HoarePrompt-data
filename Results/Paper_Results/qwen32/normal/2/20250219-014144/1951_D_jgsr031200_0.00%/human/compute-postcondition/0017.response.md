The code snippet updates the value of `curr` to `n // i`. Given the initial state, `i` is `1`, so `curr` becomes `n // 1`, which simplifies to `n`.

Therefore, the updated value of `curr` is `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `n - i * (n // k)`, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\), `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // k`, `curr` is `n`, `i` is `1`**.
