Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), \(n \neq k\), and \(n \geq k\).
- `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is `n // k`.
- `curr` is `n // k`.

Code Snippet:
```python
n -= i * curr
```

The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it is a given integer. The operation modifies `n` by subtracting `i * curr` from it. Since `curr` is `n // k`, the new value of `n` will be `n - i * (n // k)`.

Output State: **`n` is `n - i * (n // k)`, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\), `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // k`, `curr` is `n // k`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - i * (n // k)`.
- The values of `k`, `costs`, `h`, and `curr` remain unchanged except that `h` and `curr` would now be recalculated based on the new value of `n`. However, since the problem specifies the initial values of `h` and `curr` and does not require recalculating them, they are kept as `n // k` with the old `n`.
- All other conditions about `n` and `k` remain the same.
