To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over the elements in the list `costs`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in costs:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only object in the loop head is `i`, which will take on the values of each element in the `costs` list during each iteration. Therefore, the state of `costs` is crucial for determining if the loop will execute.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), \(n \neq k\), and \(n \geq k\).
- `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is 0.

Since `costs` is a list with two elements (`[n - k + 1, 1]`), the loop will execute because there are elements in the list to iterate over. The initial state already ensures that the loop can execute.

However, according to the instructions, we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which is `i` in this case. Since `i` is just an iterator variable and its value is determined by the elements in `costs`, no adjustment is needed for `i` itself. The state of `costs` is already correct for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state remains as provided:

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is 0**.
