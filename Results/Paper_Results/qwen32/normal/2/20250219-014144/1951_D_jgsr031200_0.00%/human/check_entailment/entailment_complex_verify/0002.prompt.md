You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

If `h` is less than `k`, then `h` remains as \(n // (n - k + 1) + n\) which simplifies to 0. If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `h` remains as \(n // (n - k + 1) + n\) which also simplifies to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k` within the range 1 to \(10^{18}\). It prints 'YES' and additional information if `n` can be reduced to 0 by subtracting multiples of `n - k + 1` and 1, such that the total number of subtractions is at least `k`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls with different prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next stall, and so on.

### Key Points:

1. **Constraints**: 
   - Number of test cases (`t`) can be up to 1000.
   - `n` and `k` can be as large as \(10^{18}\).
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine if it's possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - If possible, provide the number of stalls and their respective prices.

### Code Analysis:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem but seems to have several issues:

1. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is called inside the loop but is not defined within the provided code snippet.

2. **Logic for Setting Prices**:
   - The logic for setting prices is incomplete and incorrect.
   - The code tries to use a greedy approach but fails to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The current implementation only considers two prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`), which is insufficient to guarantee the solution for all cases.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case when `n == k` by setting a single stall with a price of `1`.
   - It also correctly identifies when `n < k` as impossible.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem, we can use a strategy that involves setting up stalls with decreasing prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One effective way is to use powers of 2 as prices, which allows us to cover a wide range of values efficiently.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    # Try to use powers of 2 as prices
    prices = []
    remaining_k = k
    remaining_n = n
    power = 0
    
    while remaining_k > 0 and power < 60:
        price = 2 ** power
        if price > remaining_n:
            break
        count = min(remaining_k, remaining_n // price)
        if count > 0:
            prices.append(price)
            remaining_k -= count
            remaining_n -= count * price
        power += 1
    
    if remaining_k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(prices))
        print(*prices)
    else:
        print('NO')

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)
```

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all cases due to insufficient logic for setting up the stall prices. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
