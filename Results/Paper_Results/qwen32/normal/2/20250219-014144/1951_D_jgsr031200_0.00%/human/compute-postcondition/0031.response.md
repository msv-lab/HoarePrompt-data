Postcondition: **`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\), `costs` is a list containing \([n - k + 1, 1]\), `curr` is 0, `i` is 1. If `h` is less than `k`, then `h` remains as \(n // (n - k + 1) + n\) which simplifies to 0. If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `h` remains as \(n // (n - k + 1) + n\) which also simplifies to 0.**
