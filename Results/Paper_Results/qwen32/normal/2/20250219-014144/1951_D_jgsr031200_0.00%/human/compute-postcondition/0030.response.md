Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `costs` is a list containing \([n - k + 1, 1]\).
- `h` is calculated as \(n // (n - k + 1) + n\).
- `curr` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `costs`**:
   - Given `n = 0`, the expression for `costs` becomes `[0 - k + 1, 1]`.
   - Simplifying this, `costs` is `[-k + 1, 1]`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(*costs)`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks the list `costs` and prints each element separated by a space.

### Final Output:
- Since `costs` is `[-k + 1, 1]`, the print statement will output `-k + 1` followed by `1`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the elements of the `costs` list, which are `-k + 1` and `1`.

Output: **-k + 1 1**
