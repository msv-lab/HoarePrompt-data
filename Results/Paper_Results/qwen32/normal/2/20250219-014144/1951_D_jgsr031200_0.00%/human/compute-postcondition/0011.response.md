Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k; `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is 0.**

Natural Language: The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as positive integers within the specified range, with `n` being greater than or equal to `k` and they are not equal. The `costs` list remains unchanged as `[n - k + 1, 1]`. The new variable `h` is initialized to 0.
