Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step against the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
- Alice has `n` coins.
- Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- Alice buys greedily: she buys as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then moves to the next stall, and so on.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).

2. **Function `func_1(n, k)`:**
   - **Base Case:** If `n == k`, it prints "YES", sets up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel, and returns.
   - **Impossible Case:** If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.
   - **Cost Calculation:**
     - It initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
     - It calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from the first stall (`curr = n // i`) and updates `h` (total jewels bought) and `n` (remaining coins).
     - After processing both costs, it checks if `h < k`. If so, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the costs.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:**
   - The program only considers two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This is insufficient to handle all cases, especially when `k` is large or when the distribution of jewel purchases across stalls needs to be more nuanced.

2. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The logic for determining the number of stalls and their prices is flawed. The program does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels in all scenarios.

3. **Handling Multiple Stalls:**
   - The problem allows up to 60 stalls, but the program only considers two stalls. It does not explore other configurations that might satisfy the condition.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to find a way to distribute the purchase of `k` jewels across up to 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One effective strategy is to use binary representation or a greedy approach to distribute the purchases.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**
