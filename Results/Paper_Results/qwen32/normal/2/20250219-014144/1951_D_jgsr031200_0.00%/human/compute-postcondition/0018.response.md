The value of `h` is incremented by the value of `curr`. Given that `h` was initially `n // k` and `curr` was initially `n`, `h` now becomes `n // k + n`.

Output State: **`n` is `n - i * (n // k)`, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\), `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `n // k + n`, `curr` is `n`, `i` is `1`**.
