Given the initial state where `n` and `k` are positive integers with the conditions \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), \(n \neq k\), and the current value of `n` is less than `k`, let's analyze the provided Python code snippet:

```python
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. This string does not depend on the values of `n` or `k`; it is a static string literal.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
