Output State: **The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 representing the total number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is the number of integers in the list `l`, and `m` is the number of queries. The list `l` contains `n` integers, and `p` is a list of cumulative sums derived from `l`. The variable `c` holds the total sum of all elements in `l`. The loop has processed all `m` queries for each of the `t` test cases. For each query defined by `a` and `b`, the sum `s` of the subarray from index `a-1` to `b-1` is calculated using the cumulative sums in `p`. If the length of the subarray is greater than 1 and the sum `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In simpler terms, the loop has completed processing all test cases and their respective queries. For each query, it determines whether the sum of the specified subarray is at least twice its length and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
