The code appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is defined as `n + x`, and `x` is the second element in the list `l`, the new list `p` will include the elements `0`, `n`, and `n + x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `p` is a list containing the integers 0, `n`, and `n + x`, `c` is `n + x`, `x` is the second element in the list `l`.**
