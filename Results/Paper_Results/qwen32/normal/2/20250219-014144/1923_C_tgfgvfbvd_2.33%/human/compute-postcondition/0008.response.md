The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l` and the variable `x`. Since `x` takes each element of `l` in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `l` that `x` hasn't taken yet.

At the end of the last iteration, `l` has at least one element, and `x` has taken that element. For the loop to execute again, `l` must have at least two elements, and `x` should be the second element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `p` is a list containing the integer 0, `c` is 0**
