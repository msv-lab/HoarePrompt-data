The code snippet sets `c` to 0. This changes the value of `c` from being the sum of all elements in the previous list `l` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is the new list of integers read from the input, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0.**
