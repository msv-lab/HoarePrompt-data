The code appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Given that `c` is defined as `x + x` (which is `2 * x`), the list `p` will now contain three elements: `0`, `x`, and `2 * x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `p` is a list containing the integers `[0, x, 2 * x]`, `c` is `x + x`, `x` is the next element in `l`.**
