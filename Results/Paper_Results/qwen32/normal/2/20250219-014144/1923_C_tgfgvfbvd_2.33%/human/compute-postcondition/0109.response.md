Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` is the first integer read from the new input, `b` is the second integer read from the new input. Either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)`**
