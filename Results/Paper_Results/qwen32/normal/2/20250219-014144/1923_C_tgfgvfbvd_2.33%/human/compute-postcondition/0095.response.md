Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `p` is a list containing the value of `c`, `c` is `c + x + x`, `x` is the next element in `l`.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is updated to be `c + x`, and since `x` is added again, `c` effectively becomes `c + x + x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
