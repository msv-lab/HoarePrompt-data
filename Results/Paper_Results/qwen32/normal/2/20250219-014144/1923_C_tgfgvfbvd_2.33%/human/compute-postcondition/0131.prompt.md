You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where each integer c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 representing the total number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is the number of integers in the list `l`, and `m` is the number of queries. The list `l` contains `n` integers, and `p` is a list of cumulative sums derived from `l`. The variable `c` holds the total sum of all elements in `l`. The loop has processed all `m` queries for each of the `t` test cases. For each query defined by `a` and `b`, the sum `s` of the subarray from index `a-1` to `b-1` is calculated using the cumulative sums in `p`. If the length of the subarray is greater than 1 and the sum `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function processes these inputs and returns the result for each query, which is not specified in detail here but generally involves some computation on the sublist of `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
