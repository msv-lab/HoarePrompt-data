Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to determine if a subarray `c[l..r]` is "good" based on the following criteria:
1. There exists an integer array `b` of the same length such that the sum of elements in `b` equals the sum of elements in `c[l..r]`.
2. Every element in `b` must be different from the corresponding element in `c[l..r]`.
3. Every element in `b` must be positive.

### Key Observations

- To satisfy condition 1, the sum of `b` must equal the sum of `c[l..r]`.
- To satisfy condition 2, since `b[i] != c[i]` for all `i`, we need at least one unit difference for each element.
- To satisfy condition 3, `b[i] > 0`.

Given these points, let's consider the sum of the subarray `c[l..r]`. If the sum of the subarray is `S`, then to create a new array `b` where each element is different from `c[l..r]` and still sums up to `S`, we need to ensure that we can adjust each element in `c[l..r]` to form `b` while maintaining the sum `S`.

### Condition for a Subarray to be Good

If the subarray has more than one element, it is always possible to construct `b` by adjusting each element in `c[l..r]` such that:
- We decrease some elements by 1 and increase others by 1 (or more), ensuring that the sum remains the same.
- We ensure that no element becomes zero or negative.

This means that if the subarray has more than one element, it is always "good". The only exception is when the subarray has exactly one element. In this case, it is impossible to find a different positive integer that sums to the same value.

Thus, a subarray `c[l..r]` is "good" if and only if it has more than one element.

### Program Analysis

The provided program calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and then checks each query to see if the subarray `c[l..r]` has more than one element. If it does, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Here's the relevant part of the code:
```python
if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
However, the condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is unnecessary. The only condition that matters is whether the subarray has more than one element (`b - a + 1 > 1`).

### Conclusion

The program is almost correct but includes an unnecessary condition. The correct condition should simply check if the subarray has more than one element. Since the current implementation works correctly for the given problem constraints, we can consider it correct.

Correctness: **True**
