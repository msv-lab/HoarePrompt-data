Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1, or `s` is less than 2 * (b - a + 1).**
