To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`, and `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once if `m` is greater than 0.
