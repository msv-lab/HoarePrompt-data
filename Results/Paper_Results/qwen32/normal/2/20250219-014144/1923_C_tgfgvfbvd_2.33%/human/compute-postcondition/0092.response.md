The code snippet provided is `c += x`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the initial state, which means there is no specific value for `x` to add to `c`. Since `x` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `c`. 

However, based on the given information and assuming `x` is intended to be a variable that should be defined elsewhere in the code (which is not provided here), we can only state that `c` will be incremented by whatever value `x` holds.

Given the lack of a defined `x`, the best we can do is express the new state of `c` in terms of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `p` is an empty list, `c` is `c + x`**.
