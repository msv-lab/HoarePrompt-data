The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is not yet defined, which implies it was initialized to 0 (the default starting point for a `range` loop). After the first iteration, `tc` would be 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `tc` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then `mexsize` remains as the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
