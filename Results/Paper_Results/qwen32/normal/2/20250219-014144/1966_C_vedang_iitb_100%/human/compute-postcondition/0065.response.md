To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the logic involved:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `tc` is a constant integer with the value 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input.
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, and it is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `maxsize`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet contains a conditional expression that checks whether `mexsize` is odd or even:
```python
print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
```

#### Explanation:
- `mexsize % 2 == 1` checks if `mexsize` is an odd number.
- If `mexsize` is odd, the string `'Alice'` is printed.
- Otherwise, the string `'Bob'` is printed.

### Determining `mexsize`:
Given that `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, it can be any integer starting from 1 upwards, but it must be the smallest one missing from the list. For example:
- If `a = [1, 2, 4]`, then `mexsize` would be `3` because `3` is the smallest positive integer missing from the list.
- If `a = [1, 2, 3]`, then `mexsize` would be `4` because `4` is the smallest positive integer missing from the list.
- If `a = [2, 3, 4]`, then `mexsize` would be `1` because `1` is the smallest positive integer missing from the list.

### Conclusion:
The output depends on whether `mexsize` is odd or even. Since the exact value of `mexsize` is determined by the input list `a`, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `mexsize` without knowing the contents of `a`. However, we can describe the output based on the parity (odd or even nature) of `mexsize`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice if mexsize is odd, otherwise Bob (where mexsize is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
