The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `maxsize`, or `mexsize`. However, the list `a` is now sorted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the new list `a`, and `mexsize` needs to be recalculated as the smallest positive integer not present in the new list `a`.**
