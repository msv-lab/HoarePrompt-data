The code snippet sets `mexsize` to 1. This does not affect the values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `a`, or `maxsize`. The only change is that `mexsize` is now explicitly set to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the new list `a`, and `mexsize` is 1.**
