The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the value of `n` will change to whatever integer is provided as input. All other variables (`t`, `tc`, `a`, `maxsize`, `mexsize`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then `mexsize` remains as the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
