The given code snippet sets `mexsize` to 1. This means that regardless of the previous value of `mexsize`, it is now explicitly set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers from the input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 1.**
