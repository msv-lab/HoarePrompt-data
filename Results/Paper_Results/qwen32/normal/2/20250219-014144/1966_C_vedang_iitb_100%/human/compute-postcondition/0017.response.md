To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `mexsize` based on the elements in the sorted list `a`.

The loop iterates over each element `sz` in the sorted list `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, it increments `mexsize` by 1. This means `mexsize` will keep increasing as long as the current element in the list matches the current value of `mexsize`.

At the end of the loop, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a`. This is because the loop effectively counts up through the integers starting from 1, incrementing `mexsize` each time it finds the current `mexsize` in the list.

Let's summarize the final output state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `tc` is still not yet defined.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `a` remains the sorted list of integers.
- `maxsize` remains the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is not yet defined, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.**
