Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one element, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the new list `a`, and `mexsize` is 1. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 2.**
