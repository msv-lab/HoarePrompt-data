Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations.
2. **`a` and `b`**: New integers read from input for each iteration. These represent the two numbers whose absolute difference is being evaluated.
3. **Absolute Difference**: The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd. This detail does not affect the print statement directly.
4. **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. It likely keeps track of the current iteration number.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement simply outputs the string `'Bob'`.
- There are no variables or conditions in the print statement that would alter the output based on the initial state provided.
- The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` do not influence the content of the print statement.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will always output the string `'Bob'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Bob**
