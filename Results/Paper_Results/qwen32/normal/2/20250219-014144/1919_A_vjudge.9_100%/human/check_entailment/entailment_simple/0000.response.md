### Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the optimal strategy for both players. Given the rules of the game, the key observation is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets determines the winner.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initial State**: Both players start with a certain number of coins, `a` and `b`.
2. **Turns**: Players alternate turns, starting with Alice.
3. **Moves**:
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or not.
   - They must then remove one coin from their current wallet.
4. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a move loses.

### Strategy Analysis:

- **Swapping Wallets**: Swapping wallets does not change the absolute difference between the number of coins in the wallets (`|a - b|`). It only changes which player holds which wallet.
- **Removing Coins**: Removing a coin from a wallet decreases the total number of coins by one, but it does not change the parity of `|a - b|`.

Given these points, the game essentially boils down to the parity of `|a - b|`:

- If `|a - b|` is even, Bob wins.
- If `|a - b|` is odd, Alice wins.

This is because:
- If the difference is even, Alice will always be forced into a position where she faces an even difference after her turn, eventually leading to a situation where she cannot make a move.
- If the difference is odd, Alice can always force Bob into an even difference, ensuring she can always make a move until Bob is left with no moves.

### Verification with Test Cases:

Let's verify the logic with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - `|a - b| = 0` (even), Bob wins.
   
2. **Test Case 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
   - `|a - b| = 3` (odd), Alice wins.
   
3. **Test Case 3**: `a = 5`, `b = 3`
   - `|a - b| = 2` (even), Bob wins.
   
4. **Test Case 4**: `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - `|a - b| = 1` (odd), Alice wins.
   
5. **Test Case 5**: `a = 11`, `b = 9`
   - `|a - b| = 2` (even), Bob wins.
   
6. **Test Case 6**: `a = 83`, `b = 91`
   - `|a - b| = 8` (even), Bob wins.
   
7. **Test Case 7**: `a = 1032`, `b = 9307`
   - `|a - b| = 8275` (odd), Alice wins.
   
8. **Test Case 8**: `a = 839204`, `b = 7281`
   - `|a - b| = 832923` (odd), Alice wins.
   
9. **Test Case 9**: `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
   - `|a - b| = 0` (even), Bob wins.
   
10. **Test Case 10**: `a = 53110`, `b = 2024`
    - `|a - b| = 51086` (even), Bob wins.

All test cases match the expected outcomes based on the parity of `|a - b|`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
