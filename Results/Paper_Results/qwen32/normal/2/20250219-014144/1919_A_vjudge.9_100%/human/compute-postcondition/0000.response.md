The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `a` and `b` for each test case are not affected by this line of code since they are not mentioned in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9.**
