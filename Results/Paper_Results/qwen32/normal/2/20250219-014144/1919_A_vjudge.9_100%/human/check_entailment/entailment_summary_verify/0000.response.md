### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the program, let's break down the problem and the provided solution in detail.

#### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Game Rules:**
   - Players take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or not.
   - After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally.
   - The game state can be analyzed based on the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

3. **Winning Strategy:**
   - If the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is **even**, Bob wins.
   - If the difference is **odd**, Alice wins.

   **Explanation:**
   - When the difference is even, Alice can always force Bob into a position where the difference remains even after her move. Eventually, Bob will be forced into a position where he cannot make a move.
   - When the difference is odd, Bob can always force Alice into a position where the difference remains odd after his move. Eventually, Alice will be forced into a position where she cannot make a move.

#### Program Analysis:

The provided program follows these rules correctly:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The program calculates the absolute difference `abs(a - b)`.
   - It checks if this difference is even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`) or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

3. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the logic implemented in the program: checking the parity of the absolute difference and determining the winner based on that.

#### Verification:

The logic implemented in the program aligns perfectly with the optimal strategy derived from the problem description. The program correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly determines the winner for each test case based on the optimal strategy described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases that the program fails to handle.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final:** **True**
