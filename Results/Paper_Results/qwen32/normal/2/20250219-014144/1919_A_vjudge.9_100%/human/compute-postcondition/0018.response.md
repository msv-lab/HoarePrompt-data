Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` has reached the value of `t` and the loop has terminated. Regardless of whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd, `i` has completed all `t` iterations.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains the same as initially provided, `a` and `b` hold the values from the last test case, and the loop variable `i` has reached `t`, meaning all test cases have been processed. The loop has ended, and no further iterations will occur.
