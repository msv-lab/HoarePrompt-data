The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `a` and `b` will be updated to the new integers read from the input. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are the new integers read from input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
