The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer read from input within the range 1 to 1000, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, and their absolute difference is either even or odd. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the new integers read from the input. The values of `t` and the condition about the absolute difference between `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The increment operation on `i` is not part of the given code snippet, so `i` remains unaffected by this specific code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd.**
