The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from input.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even.

Despite these details, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward.

Output: **Bob**
