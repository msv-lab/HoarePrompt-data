### Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`abs(a - b)`) determines the winner when both players play optimally.

Let's break down why this is the case:

1. **Initial State**: Both players start with a certain number of coins in their wallets.
2. **Turns**: Players take turns exchanging wallets or keeping them, and then removing one coin from their current wallet.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., whose wallet is empty) loses.

### Key Insight:

- If `abs(a - b)` is **even**, Bob wins.
- If `abs(a - b)` is **odd**, Alice wins.

#### Why?

- **Even Difference**: If the difference between the number of coins is even, Alice will always be left with a situation where she has to face Bob with an odd difference after her turn. Bob can always mirror Alice's moves to ensure he leaves Alice with an even difference again. Eventually, Alice will be forced into a position where she cannot make a move (both wallets will be empty), and Bob wins.
  
- **Odd Difference**: Conversely, if the difference is odd initially, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even difference. By doing so, Alice ensures that she will always be the one to force Bob into a losing position (both wallets empty).

### Verification with Examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
  - `abs(1 - 1) = 0` (even)
  - Bob wins.
  
- **Test Case 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
  - `abs(1 - 4) = 3` (odd)
  - Alice wins.

These examples align with the logic derived above.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
