Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. However, the current implementation simply counts the occurrences of the median element in the sorted array and prints this count, which does not address the requirement to increase the median.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the median of the array, determine the smallest value that can be added to one or more elements to ensure the median increases, and calculate the minimum number of such operations. The current implementation fails to perform these steps.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
