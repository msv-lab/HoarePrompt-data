Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Median Definition**: 
   - For an array `q` of length `k`, the median is the element at index `ceil(k/2) - 1` in the sorted version of `q`.
   - If `k` is odd, the median is the middle element.
   - If `k` is even, the median is the lower middle element.

2. **Objective**:
   - We need to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
   - An operation consists of choosing an integer `i` and increasing `a[i]` by 1.

3. **Approach**:
   - Sort the array to easily locate the median.
   - Identify the current median.
   - Determine how many elements are equal to the current median.
   - To increase the median, we need to ensure that more than half of the elements are greater than the current median.
   - The minimum number of operations will be the count of elements equal to the current median because we can increment each of these elements to make them greater than the current median.

### Program Analysis:

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1  # This correctly identifies the median index for both odd and even lengths
        res = a.count(a[p])  # Counts the occurrences of the current median
        print(res)
```

- **Sorting**: The array is sorted, which is necessary to find the median.
- **Median Index Calculation**: `p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1` correctly calculates the median index for both odd and even lengths of the array.
- **Counting Median Occurrences**: `res = a.count(a[p])` counts how many times the median appears in the array.
- **Output**: The program prints the count of the median occurrences, which is supposed to be the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

### Correctness Evaluation:

The logic in the program seems correct based on the problem requirements. However, there is a subtle issue:

- **Increasing the Median**: Simply counting the occurrences of the median does not guarantee that incrementing these elements will increase the median. For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The median is `1`, and there are `5` occurrences. Incrementing any of these `1`s will not change the median because the new median will still be `1`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that after incrementing, the new median is strictly greater than the old median. This requires a different approach, such as using a min-heap or a selection algorithm to efficiently find the minimum number of increments needed to shift the median.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not account for the requirement that the new median must be strictly greater than the old median.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
