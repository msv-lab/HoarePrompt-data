Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Instead, it counts the occurrences of the current median value in the sorted array, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to focus on increasing the median value itself. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline of how to achieve this:

1. **Sort the array**: This helps in easily identifying the median.
2. **Identify the median**: For an odd-length array, it's the middle element. For an even-length array, it's the lower of the two middle elements.
3. **Determine the target median**: The target median should be the smallest number greater than the current median.
4. **Count the number of increments needed**: To make the current median equal to the target median, count how many elements need to be incremented.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    import heapq
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1  # Index of the median
        current_median = a[p]
        
        # Find the next number greater than the current median
        next_median = current_median + 1
        while next_median in a:
            next_median += 1
        
        # Use a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum number of increments
        heap = []
        for i in range(p + 1):
            heapq.heappush(heap, a[i])
        
        operations = 0
        while heap and heap[0] < next_median:
            val = heapq.heappop(heap)
            increment = next_median - val
            operations += increment
            heapq.heappush(heap, next_median)
        
        print(operations)

func()
```

This program uses a min-heap to efficiently calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median to the next higher unique value.
