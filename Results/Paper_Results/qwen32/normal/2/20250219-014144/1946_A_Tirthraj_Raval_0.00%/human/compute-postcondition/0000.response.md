The provided Python code snippet is just a comment and does not contain any executable code. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) will be affected by this snippet. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
