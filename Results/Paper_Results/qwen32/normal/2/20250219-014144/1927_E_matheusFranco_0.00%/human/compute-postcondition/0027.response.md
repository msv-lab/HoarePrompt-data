The given code modifies the `permutation` list by setting the value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to `curr_v`. Here's the updated state:

- `n` and `k` remain integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
- `permutation` is updated such that the value at index `k + 1` (which is `multiples_of_k_plus_i`) is now `curr_v`.
- `idx`, `idx_v`, `curr_v`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `permutation[k + 1]` is set to `floor(n/k) + 2`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, `floor(n/k) + 2` at position `k + 1`, and 0 elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + 2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + 1`; `i` is 1.**
