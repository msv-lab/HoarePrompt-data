You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        t -= 1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` repeatedly calls `func_1` a number of times specified by the integer input `t`. After `t` calls, the function terminates without returning any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to generate a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation means that among all the sums of continuous segments of length k, any two sums differ by no more than 1.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads a pair of integers `n` and `k`, constructs a permutation, and prints it.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

#### Function `func_1()`:
1. It reads `n` and `k`.
2. Initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
3. Uses a loop to fill the permutation list in a specific pattern:
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `k-1`, it places values starting from 1 into positions that are multiples of `k` plus `i`.
   - The variable `curr_v` keeps track of the current value to be placed in the permutation list.
4. After filling the permutation list, it converts the list to a string and prints it.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement to see if the program generates the correct output.

#### Test Case 1: `n = 2`, `k = 2`
- The program will place values in positions 0 and 1.
- The resulting permutation could be `[1, 2]` or `[2, 1]` depending on the order of filling.
- Both permutations are valid because the sum of the segment of length 2 is the same (3).

#### Test Case 2: `n = 3`, `k = 2`
- The program will place values in positions 0, 1, and 2.
- One possible permutation is `[1, 3, 2]`.
- The sums of segments of length 2 are 4 and 3, which differ by 1, making it a valid k-level permutation.

#### Test Case 3: `n = 10`, `k = 4`
- The program will place values in positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- One possible permutation is `[1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]`.
- The sums of segments of length 4 are 23, 29, 23, 23, 25, 23, and 23, which have a maximum difference of 6, which is incorrect. This indicates that the program might not be generating the correct permutation.

### Conclusion:
Upon closer inspection, the provided program does not guarantee that the generated permutation will be a k-level permutation. The pattern of filling the permutation list does not ensure that the sums of all segments of length `k` will differ by no more than 1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The provided program does not guarantee that the generated permutation will be a k-level permutation, as the sums of all segments of length `k` may differ by more than 1.
Correctness: **False**
