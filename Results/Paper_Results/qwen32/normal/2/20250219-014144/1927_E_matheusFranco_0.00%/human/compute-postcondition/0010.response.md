To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider how the loop modifies the variable `t`. The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, and in each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. This means that the loop will execute exactly `t` times, reducing `t` to 0 by the end of the last iteration.

Given the initial state where `t` is an input integer, and considering the loop's behavior, after all iterations, `t` will be 0 because the loop terminates when `t` becomes 0.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:

Output State: **t is 0.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has run for as many times as the initial value of `t`, the variable `t` will be reduced to 0.
