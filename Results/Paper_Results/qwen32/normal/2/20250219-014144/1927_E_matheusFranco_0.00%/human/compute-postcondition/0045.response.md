To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.

Given the current state:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + 2*k`.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`, which is `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Current Value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i`:**
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + 2*k`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `2 + 2*k < n`.

### Adjustment:
- Since `k` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even, and `n` must be greater than 4, we need to ensure that `2 + 2*k` is less than `n`.

- To guarantee that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` such that `n > 2 + 2*k`.

### Conclusion:
- Given the current state, no changes are required to `multiples_of_k_plus_i` or any other variables directly involved in the loop condition.
- We only need to ensure that `n` is sufficiently large to satisfy `n > 2 + 2*k`.

Since `n` is already stated to be greater than 4, and `k` is at least 2, `2 + 2*k` will be at least 6. Therefore, `n` should be greater than 6 to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, `floor(n/k) + 2` at position `k + 1`, ..., `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k)` at position `(floor((n-1)/k) - 1) * k + 1`, and 0 elsewhere except `permutation[2]` which is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 1` and `permutation[2 + k]` which is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 2`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 3`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + 2*k`; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 6**.
