To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`. 

Here's the given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + 3`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2k + 1`.
- `i` is 1.

The loop will continue as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`. Since `len(permutation)` is `n`, the condition becomes `multiples_of_k_plus_i < n`.

Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2k + 1`, we need to ensure that `2k + 1 < n` for the loop to execute one more time. Since `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n`, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than `2k + 1`.

No other variables in the loop head (`multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `n`) need to be adjusted directly because the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and `n` is already part of the loop head condition.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `n > 2k + 1`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `n` must be greater than `2k + 1`; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, `floor(n/k) + 2` at position `k + 1`, and 0 elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + 3`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2k + 1`; `i` is 1.**
