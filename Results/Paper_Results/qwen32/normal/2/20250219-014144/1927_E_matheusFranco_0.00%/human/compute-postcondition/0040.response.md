The given code snippet increments the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by the value of `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` with specific values based on the description.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 2`.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2.
- `i` is 2.

After executing `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k`, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` changes from 2 to `2 + k`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, `floor(n/k) + 2` at position `k + 1`, ..., `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k)` at position `(floor((n-1)/k) - 1) * k + 1`, and 0 elsewhere except `permutation[2]` which is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 1`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + floor((n-1)/k) + 2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `2 + k`; `i` is 2; `n` must be at least 3.**
