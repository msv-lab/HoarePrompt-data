The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Since the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`, we need to adjust `i` to the next value it would take in the next iteration.

Given that `i` is currently `0` (as it is the first iteration), the next value of `i` should be `1` for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, and 0 elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + 1`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `n`; `i` is 1**
