Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, and 0 elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + 2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1; `i` is 1.**

In simple terms, the only change is that `curr_v` has been incremented by 1, making its new value `floor(n/k) + 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
