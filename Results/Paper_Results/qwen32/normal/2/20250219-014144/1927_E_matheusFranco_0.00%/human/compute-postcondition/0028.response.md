Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of length `n` with values 1, 2, ..., `floor(n/k)` at positions 0, `k`, `2k`, ..., `(floor(n/k) - 1) * k`, `floor(n/k) + 1` at position 1, `floor(n/k) + 2` at position `k + 1`, and 0 elsewhere; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor(n/k) + 3`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k + 1`; `i` is 1.** 

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `curr_v` has been incremented by 1, making it `floor(n/k) + 3`. All other variables retain their initial values.
