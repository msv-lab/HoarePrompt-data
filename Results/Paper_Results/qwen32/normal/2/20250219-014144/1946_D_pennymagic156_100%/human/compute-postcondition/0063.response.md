Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is a list containing `ai` values appended whenever `op` was 0 if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` is an empty list. `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`. `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`. If `u == v == 0`, the program does not change the state of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `u`, or `v`.**
