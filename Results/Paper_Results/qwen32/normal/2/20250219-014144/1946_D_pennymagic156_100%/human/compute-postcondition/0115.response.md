To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

```python
u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
```

Here's what happens:
- `u` is assigned the value of `(x >> i) & 1`. This operation shifts the bits of `x` to the right by `i` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with `1`, effectively extracting the `i-th` bit of `x`.
- `v` is assigned the sum of the `i-th` bits of all elements in the list `a`. This is done by iterating over each element in `a`, shifting its bits to the right by `i` positions, performing a bitwise AND with `1` to extract the `i-th` bit, and summing these bits.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` contains `ai` values where `op` was 0 during each iteration if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`.
- `t` remains an empty list.
- `i` is 28.

After executing the code, the new values of `u` and `v` are calculated as described above. The values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains `ai` values where `op` was 0 during each iteration if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` remains an empty list, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`.**
