Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must contain at least 30 elements, `t` remains an empty list, `i` is 29, `u` is the 29th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 29th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `val` is the 30th element of `a`. If `op` was initially 0, `cnt` is 2; otherwise, `cnt` is 1.**
