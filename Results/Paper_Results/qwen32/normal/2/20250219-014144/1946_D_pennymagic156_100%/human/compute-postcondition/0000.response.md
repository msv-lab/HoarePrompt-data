Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. The length of the array `a` is now `n`, and `x` is a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\).**

Explanation: The function `func_3()` returns two values which are assigned to `n` and `x`. The value of `n` determines the length of the array `a`, and `x` remains a non-negative integer less than \(2^{30}\). The initial state of `a` is not specified to change, but its length is now defined by `n`.
