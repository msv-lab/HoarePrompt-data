Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is a list containing `ai` values appended whenever `op` was 0 if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` is an empty list. `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0. `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`. `v` is even and non-zero. `op` is 0. `cnt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    if not op:
        cnt += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a non-empty list, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0, `cnt` is 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a non-empty list, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is 2 if `op` was initially 0, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `val` is the next element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a non-empty list, `t` is an empty list, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `cnt` is 3 if `op` was initially 0, otherwise `cnt` is 2, `val` is the next element in the list `a` after the previously processed element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
