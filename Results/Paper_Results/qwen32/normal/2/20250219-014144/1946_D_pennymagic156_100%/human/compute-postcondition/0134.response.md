To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
op ^= val >> i & 1
```

This line performs a bitwise operation involving the variables `op`, `val`, and `i`.

- `val >> i` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions.
- `& 1` performs a bitwise AND operation with `1`, effectively extracting the least significant bit (LSB) of the shifted value.
- `^=` performs an in-place XOR operation between `op` and the extracted bit.

Given the initial state, we know:
- The loop has terminated after processing the 30th element of `a`.
- However, the specific values of `op`, `val`, and `i` are not provided.

Since the exact values of `op`, `val`, and `i` are not specified, we can only describe the transformation in terms of these variables.

The operation modifies `op` by XORing it with the LSB of `val` shifted by `i` positions.

Therefore, the updated value of `op` will be the result of the XOR operation described above.

Output State: **The loop terminates as there are no more elements in `a` after the 30th element; `op` is updated to `op ^ ((val >> i) & 1)`.**
