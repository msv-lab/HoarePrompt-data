The given code snippet updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. This means that if `cnt` is greater than the current value of `ans`, `ans` will be updated to `cnt`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Here's the Output State considering the initial conditions and the effect of the code snippet:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` remains an empty list, `i` is the length of `a` minus 1, `u` is the 28th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero, `op` is the XOR of all the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` for `i` ranging from 28 to the length of `a` minus 1, `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `ans` now holds the maximum value between its previous value and `cnt`. All other variables retain their initial values.
