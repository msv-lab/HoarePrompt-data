The given code snippet modifies the value of `op` using the XOR assignment operator (`^=`) with a calculated expression. Here's the breakdown:

- `val >> i & 1` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` positions (which is 28) and then performs a bitwise AND with 1. This operation extracts the 28th bit of `val`.
- `op ^= ...` updates `op` by performing a bitwise XOR between its current value and the extracted bit.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` is a list containing at least 30 elements.
- `i` is 28.
- `u` is the 28th bit of `x`.
- `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`.
- If `op` is False, then `t` is a list containing `val` and `ai` is 0. Otherwise, `t` remains an empty list and `ai` is `val`.
- `val` is the 30th element of `a`.

The only variable affected by the code is `op`. Its new value depends on its original value and the 28th bit of `val`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least 30 elements, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `t` is a list containing `val` if `op` was initially False, otherwise `t` is an empty list, `ai` is 0 if `op` was initially False, otherwise `ai` is `val`, `val` is the 30th element of `a`.**
