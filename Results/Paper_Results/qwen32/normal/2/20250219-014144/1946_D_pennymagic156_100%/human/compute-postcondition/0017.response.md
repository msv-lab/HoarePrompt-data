The code appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list with at least one element, `t` is a list containing `ai`, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` equals 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]` and `v` is even, `op` is 0, `ai` is `val`. The condition `not op` is true, meaning `op` is 0.**
