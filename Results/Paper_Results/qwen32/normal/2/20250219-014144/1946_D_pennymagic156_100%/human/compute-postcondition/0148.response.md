To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
op ^= val >> i & 1
```

Here, `val` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we'll assume it's a variable that holds some integer value. The operation involves shifting `val` right by `i` bits (which is 28), performing a bitwise AND with 1 to isolate the 29th bit (since indexing starts from 0), and then performing a bitwise XOR with `op`.

Given that `u` is the 28th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0, we can infer that `x >> i & 1` would yield the same result as `u` (which is 1). However, since `val` is not specified, we'll consider the general case.

Let's denote the 28th bit of `val` as `bit_val`. The operation `op ^= bit_val` means that `op` will be updated to `op ^ bit_val`. Since `op` was initially 0, the new value of `op` will simply be `bit_val`.

Therefore, the new value of `op` will depend on the 28th bit of `val`. However, since `val` is not specified, we can only say that `op` will be updated to the 28th bit of `val`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must contain at least one element, `t` remains an empty list, `i` is 28, `u` is the 28th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero, `op` is the 28th bit of `val`, `cnt` is 0**.
