Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` equals 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]`. Additionally, `v` is even, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `op` and `ai` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
