To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `val`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` is a list containing at least one `ai` value.
- `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list.
- `u` equals 0.
- `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`.
- `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` retains its original value.

Since the loop iterates over `a`, the variable `val` will take the next value from the list `a` in the next iteration. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `val`.

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `val` was the first element of `a`. In the next iteration, `val` should be the second element of `a`.

State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing at least one `ai` value, `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list, `u` equals 0, `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` retains its original value, `val` is the second element of `a`**.
