The given code snippet sets `ai` to 0. No other variables are modified by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `op`, and `val` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is a list containing at least two `ai` values where the first `ai` value is now the original value before the first XOR operation with `val`. If `op` was 0, `t` contains `ai` and `ai` is set to 0. Otherwise, `t` remains an empty list and now includes `ai`. `u` equals 0, and `v` is `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`. `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. `val` is the third element of `a`. `ai` is 0.**
