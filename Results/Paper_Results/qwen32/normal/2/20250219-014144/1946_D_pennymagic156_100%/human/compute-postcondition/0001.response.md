The code snippet reassigns the variable `a` to the value returned by the function `func_1()`. This means the previous value of `a` (which had a length of `n`) is replaced by whatever `func_1()` returns. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. The variable `a` is now the value returned by `func_1()`.**
