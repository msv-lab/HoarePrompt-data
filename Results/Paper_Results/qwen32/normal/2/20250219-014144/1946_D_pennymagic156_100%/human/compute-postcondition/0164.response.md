Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` if `u` is not equal to 0. `t` remains an empty list. `i` is the length of `a` minus 1 if `v` is non-zero, otherwise `i` is 28. `u` is the 28th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0. `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero. If `v` is non-zero, `op` is the XOR of all the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` for `i` ranging from 28 to the length of `a` minus 1, `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is zero, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement without modifying `op`, `cnt`, or `ans`.**
