The code snippet increments the variable `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is either 0 or 1. After the increment, `cnt` will be 1 or 2 respectively.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must contain at least 30 elements, `t` remains an empty list, `i` is 29, `u` is the 29th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the 29th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero, `op` is the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `val` is the 29th element of `a`, `cnt` is 1 or 2 depending on its initial value.**
