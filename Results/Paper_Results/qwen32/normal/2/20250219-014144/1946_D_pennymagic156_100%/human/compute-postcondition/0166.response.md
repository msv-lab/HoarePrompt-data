Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains the accumulated values of `ai` whenever `op` became 0 during the loop if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` remains an empty list. `i` is 28 if `u == v == 0`, otherwise `i` is the length of `a` minus 1 if `v` is non-zero. `u` is the 28th bit of `x` and is not equal to 0 if `v` is non-zero. `v` is the sum of the 28th bits of all elements in `a`. If `v % 2` is not equal to 0, no additional changes are made to `i`. If `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is the XOR of all the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` for `i` ranging from 28 to the length of `a` minus 1, `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, and `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `v` is zero, `op`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**
