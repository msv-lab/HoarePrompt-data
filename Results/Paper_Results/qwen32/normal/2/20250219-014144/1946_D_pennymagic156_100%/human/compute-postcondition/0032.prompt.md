Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` equals 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]`. Additionally, `v` is even, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    ai ^= val
    if not op:
        t.append(ai)
        ai = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list with at least one element, `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` equals 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]` and `v` is even, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list with at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` equals 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]` and `v` is even, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0 if the condition `not op` is true, and `t` now contains `ai` as its second element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list with at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `val` as its first element, `val` as its second element, and `ai` as its third element, `ans` is -1, `u` is `(x >> i) & 1` and `u` equals 0, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]` and `v` is even, `op` is `(val >> i) & 1`. If `op` is 0, then `ai` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
