Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list containing `ai` values appended whenever `op` was 0 if `u` equals 0, otherwise `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`. `t` is an empty list. `u` is `(x >> i) & 1`. If `u` equals 0 and `v` (the sum of `[(val >> i & 1) for val in a]`) is even, `v` remains even, and `ans` is -1. If `u` equals 0 and `v` is odd, `v` remains odd, and `ans` is -1. If `u` does not equal 0 and `v` is odd, the state remains as described. If `u` does not equal 0 and `v` is even and not zero, `ans` is `max(-1, cnt)` where `cnt` is the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, which is at least 1. If `u` does not equal 0 and `v` is 0, `ans` remains -1.**
