In this case, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`. These variables are mentioned in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is described as an integer between 0 and 1000 (exclusive of 0, inclusive of 1000). However, it is not referenced in the `print` statement.
2. The variable `s` is described as a new string input by the user. Again, it is not referenced in the `print` statement.
3. The variable `s2` is described as a permutation of the original string `s`. It is also not referenced in the `print` statement.

Since none of these variables affect the `print` statement, the output will always be the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
