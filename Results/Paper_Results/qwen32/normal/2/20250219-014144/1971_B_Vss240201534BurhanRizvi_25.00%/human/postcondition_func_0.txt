The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` of lowercase English letters. It then generates a random permutation of `s` and checks if the permuted string `s2` is different from the original string `s`. If they are different, it prints "Yes" followed by the permuted string; otherwise, it prints "No". This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.
