### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by generating a random permutation of the input string `s` and checking if this permutation is different from the original string. If it is different, the program outputs "YES" followed by the new permutation; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

However, there is a critical flaw in this approach. The use of `random.sample` does not guarantee that a different permutation will be generated, especially for strings with repeated characters. For example, if the input string is "aaaaa", any permutation of this string will still be "aaaaa". Therefore, the program might incorrectly output "NO" even when a valid rearrangement exists.

To ensure correctness, the program should systematically generate a different permutation rather than relying on randomness. One way to do this is to swap two distinct characters in the string if possible. If the string consists of identical characters, then it is impossible to form a different permutation.

### Correctness:

Given the reasoning above, the current implementation may fail for certain inputs due to its reliance on randomness. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
