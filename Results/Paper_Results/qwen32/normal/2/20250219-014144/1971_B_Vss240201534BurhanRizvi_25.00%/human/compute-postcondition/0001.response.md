The code snippet `s = input()` changes the value of `s` to whatever string is input by the user. The initial state specifies that `s` was a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, and `t` was an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. After the code executes, `s` will be replaced with the new input string, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the string input by the user**.
