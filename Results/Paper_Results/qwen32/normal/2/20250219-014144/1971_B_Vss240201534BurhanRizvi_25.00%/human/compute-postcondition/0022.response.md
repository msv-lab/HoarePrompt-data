Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 1000, `s` is the new string input by the user, and `s2` is a permutation of the original string `s`. If `s` is not equal to `s2`, then the program executes the if part; otherwise, it executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `t`, `s`, and `s2` remain consistent with the precondition.**
