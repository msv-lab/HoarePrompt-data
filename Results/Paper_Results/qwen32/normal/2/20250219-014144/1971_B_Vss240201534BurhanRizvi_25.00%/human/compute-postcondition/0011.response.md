The code generates a new permutation of the string `s` and assigns it to `s2`. Since `s2` is now a new permutation of `s`, it may or may not be equal to `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 1000, `s` is the string input by the user, `s2` is a permutation of the string `s`. If `s` is not equal to `s2`, then `s` and `s2` are different permutations of each other. Otherwise, `s` is equal to `s2`.**
