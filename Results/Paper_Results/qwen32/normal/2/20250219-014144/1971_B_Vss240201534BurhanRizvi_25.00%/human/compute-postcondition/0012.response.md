Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `s2` is a permutation of the string `s`.
  - If `s` is not equal to `s2`, then `s` and `s2` are different permutations of each other.
  - Otherwise, `s` is equal to `s2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('Yes')` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`. The conditions and relationships between `s` and `s2` do not affect the execution of this print statement.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'Yes'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
