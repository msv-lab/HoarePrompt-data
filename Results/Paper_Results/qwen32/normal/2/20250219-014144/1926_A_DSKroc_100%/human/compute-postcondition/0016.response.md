Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32; `s` is the input string that must have at least one character; `i` is the next character in the string `s` (the character following the one processed in the previous iteration); `ac` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `ac` is increased by 1. All other variables (`t`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
