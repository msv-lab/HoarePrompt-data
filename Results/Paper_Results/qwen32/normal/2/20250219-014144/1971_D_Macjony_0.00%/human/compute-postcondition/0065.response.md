Postcondition: **`t` is the same input integer, `s` is the same input string, `count` is the number of character transitions in `s`, `flag` is True if there is at least one '01' in `s`, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `i` is the same as initially calculated. If `flag` is True, `count` reflects the number of character transitions in `s` accurately.**
