Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the newly input string with length greater than 1; `count` is 2; `j` is 1 if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `j` remains 0; `i` is `len(s)` if `len(s) < t`, otherwise `i` is `(len(s) + 1) % t`; `flag` is True if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `flag` remains False. Additionally, the character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `j + 1` unless `j` has been incremented to 1 due to the if condition being met.**
