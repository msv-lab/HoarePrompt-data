Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases (with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and for each test case, `s`, which is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with a length between 1 and 500. The function processes each string `s` and returns a result for each test case.**
