Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and for each test case, `s` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 500.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to an integer input by the user, while the condition about `s` remains unchanged as it pertains to subsequent test cases.
