You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` binary strings `s`. For each string `s`, it calculates and prints the number of segments of consecutive identical characters, reducing the count by one if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).
- Each piece must be a contiguous substring.
- The number of test cases `t` is given, followed by `t` binary strings.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through each binary string and counts transitions from '0' to '1'. For each transition, it increments the count of pieces. There's also a flag to check if there's at least one '01' transition, and if so, it decrements the count by 1.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - If the string consists entirely of '0's or '1's, the count should remain 1.
   - If there are multiple consecutive '01' transitions, the program might not handle it correctly.

2. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The flag `flag` is set when there's a '01' transition, but the decrement happens unconditionally after the loop. This means if there are multiple '01' transitions, the count will be decremented only once, which is incorrect.

### Test Cases:
Let's consider a few test cases to verify the correctness:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `11010`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Actual Output: `3` (Correct)
   
2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `00000000`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Actual Output: `1` (Correct)
   
3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Actual Output: `1` (Correct)
   
4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `10`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Actual Output: `2` (Correct)
   
5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `0001111`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Actual Output: `1` (Correct)
   
6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `0110`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Actual Output: `2` (Correct)

However, let's consider a more complex case:

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `01010101`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Actual Output: `3` (Incorrect)

### Explanation of Incorrectness:
For the input `01010101`, the program will count the transitions from '0' to '1' and '1' to '0', resulting in a count of 4. However, the flag `flag` will be set because there's at least one '01' transition, and the count will be decremented by 1, resulting in 3. This is incorrect because we need 4 pieces to sort this string.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle multiple '01' transitions correctly. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

### Additional Note:
To fix the program, the logic for counting pieces should be adjusted to correctly account for all necessary cuts without incorrectly decrementing the count.
