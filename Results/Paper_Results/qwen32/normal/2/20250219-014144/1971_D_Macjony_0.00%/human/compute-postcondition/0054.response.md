The code increments the value of `j` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be its previous value plus one.

Given the initial state, `j` was set to `len(s) - 1` if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `j` was set to `len(s) - 2`.

After executing `j += 1`, if `j` was initially `len(s) - 1`, it will now be `len(s)`. If `j` was initially `len(s) - 2`, it will now be `len(s) - 1`.

Other variables (`t`, `s`, `i`, `count`, `flag`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a newly input string with length greater than 1; `i` is `len(s)` if `len(s) < t`, otherwise `i` is `(len(s) + 1) % t`; `count` is 3 if `s[j] != s[j + 1]`, otherwise `count` is 2; `flag` is True if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is `len(s)` if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `j` is `len(s) - 1`.**
