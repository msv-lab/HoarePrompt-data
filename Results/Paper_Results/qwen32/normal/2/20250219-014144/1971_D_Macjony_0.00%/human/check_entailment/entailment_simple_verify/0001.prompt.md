You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) we need to cut a binary string into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (all '0's followed by all '1's).

### Key Observations:
1. **Transition Points**: The critical points in the string are where a '0' is immediately followed by a '1'. These transitions indicate potential cuts.
2. **Counting Cuts**: For every transition from '0' to '1', we need an additional piece because the '0's and '1's need to be separated initially to allow rearrangement.
3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If there are no transitions ('000...' or '111...'), only one piece is needed.
   - If the string starts with '1' and ends with '0', we might overcount the pieces since the last segment doesn't require a separate piece after the final '0'.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it initializes `count` to 1 (indicating at least one piece).
- It iterates through the string, checking for transitions from '0' to '1'.
- Each transition increases the `count`.
- There's a special check (`flag`) to see if the string ends with a '0' following a '1'. If so, it decrements `count` by 1, correcting for the overcount.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Initialization**: `count` is set to 1 because even an empty string or a uniform string needs at least one piece.
2. **Loop Through String**: The loop checks each character against the next one.
3. **Transition Detection**: When a '0' is followed by a '1', `count` is incremented.
4. **Final Adjustment**: If the string ends with a '0' after a '1', the final piece is not needed separately, so `count` is decremented.

### Verification Against Examples:
- **Example 1**: "11010" -> Transitions: 2 ('1'->'0', '0'->'1'). Final `count`: 3 (correct).
- **Example 2**: "00000000" -> No transitions. Final `count`: 1 (correct).
- **Example 3**: "1" -> No transitions. Final `count`: 1 (correct).
- **Example 4**: "10" -> One transition. Final `count`: 2 (correct).
- **Example 5**: "0001111" -> One transition. Final `count`: 1 (correct).
- **Example 6**: "0110" -> Two transitions. Final `count`: 2 (correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the binary string into a sorted order. All edge cases and examples are handled appropriately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
