Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a string with a length of at least 4; `count` is either 2 or 3; `flag` is True if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `j` is 3, otherwise `j` is 2.**
