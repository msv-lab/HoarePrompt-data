Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`. If `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` is `5 * m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `4 * m`.**
