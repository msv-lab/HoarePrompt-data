The given code snippet only assigns the string `'ABCDEF'` to the variable `p`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `ans`) are modified.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `s` is the string from the input; `ans` is 0; `p` is `'ABCDEF'`**.
