To determine the Output State, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
ans += m - hmp[i]
```

Here's what happens:
- `ans` is incremented by the difference between `m` and the value of `hmp[i]`.

Given the Initial State:
- `t` is 1
- `n` is the first integer from the new input
- `m` is the second integer from the new input
- `s` is a non-empty string
- `p` is 'ABCDEF'
- `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in the non-empty string `s`
- `i` is the next key in `hmp`

The only variable that changes value here is `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `p`, `hmp`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in the non-empty string `s`, `i` is the next key in `hmp`, `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]`**.
