The code snippet `ans += m - hmp[i]` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of `m - hmp[i]` to it. Here, `m` is the second integer from the input, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in the string `s`, and `i` is `next_key`.

Given these details, the value of `ans` will be updated based on the difference between `m` and the count of the character `i` in the string `s` as stored in `hmp`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is `'ABCDEF'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`, `i` is `next_key`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (m - hmp[i])`.**
