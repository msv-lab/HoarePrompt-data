Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and prints them after potentially swapping corresponding digits based on specific rules. It ensures that after processing, the first digit of the first number is not less than the first digit of the second number, and for subsequent digits, it swaps them if the digit in the first number is greater than the corresponding digit in the second number. The function prints the modified numbers on two separate lines.**
