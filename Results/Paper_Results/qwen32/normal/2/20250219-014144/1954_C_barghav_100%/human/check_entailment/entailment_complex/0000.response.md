### Reasoning:

The provided code aims to maximize the product of two integers `x` and `y` by swapping their corresponding digits under certain conditions. Let's break down the logic of the function `func_1` and see if it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` and `b` are lists that store the digits of `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - `f` is a flag initialized to 0, which will be used to track if any swap has occurred or if the condition `a[i] > b[i]` has been met.

2. **First Loop (Swapping Logic)**:
   - The loop iterates over each digit position of `a` and `b`.
   - If `f` is 0 (no swap has occurred yet and no `a[i] > b[i]` has been encountered):
     - If `a[i] < b[i]`, swap the digits at position `i` in `a` and `b`, and set `f` to 1.
     - If `a[i] > b[i]`, set `f` to 1 (no swap needed but we've encountered a situation where `a[i] > b[i]`).
   - If `f` is 1 (either a swap has occurred or `a[i] > b[i]` has been encountered):
     - Swap the digits at position `i` in `a` and `b` if `a[i] > b[i]`.

3. **Printing the Results**:
   - After the loop, the function prints the modified `a` and `b` as strings.

### Analysis:

- The goal is to maximize the product of `x` and `y`. The strategy used in the code is to ensure that the first digit of `a` is not less than the first digit of `b`. For subsequent digits, it swaps them if the digit in `a` is greater than the corresponding digit in `b`.
- This approach ensures that the most significant digits of `a` and `b` are as large as possible, which generally helps in maximizing the product.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the provided example with the given code:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `x = 73`, `y = 31`
   - After processing: `a = [7, 1]`, `b = [3, 3]`
   - Output: 
     ```
     71
     33
     ```
   - This output matches the expected result.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `x = 2`, `y = 5`
   - After processing: `a = [5]`, `b = [2]`
   - Output: 
     ```
     5
     2
     ```
   - This output matches the expected result.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `x = 3516`, `y = 3982`
   - After processing: `a = [3, 9, 1, 2]`, `b = [3, 5, 8, 6]`
   - Output: 
     ```
     3912
     3586
     ```
   - This output matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping corresponding digits based on the specified rules. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.

**Correctness: True**
