Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100, both consist only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same length, `a` is a list of digits from the input string `s` that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of characters from the new input string, `f` is 0. The current value of `f` is 0. Additionally, the `i`-th element of `a` is less than the `i`-th element of `b`.**
