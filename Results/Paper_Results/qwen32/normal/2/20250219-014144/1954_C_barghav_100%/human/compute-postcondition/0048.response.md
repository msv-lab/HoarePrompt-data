To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `t`, `x`, `y`, `a` remain unchanged (their specific values are not provided).
- `b` is a list with at least 3 elements.
- `i` is set to 3.
- `f` is set to 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `b` is a list with at least 3 elements. This means `b` could be something like `[element0, element1, element2, element3, ...]`.
- The variable `i` is set to 3.
- Therefore, `b[i]` translates to `b[3]`, which refers to the fourth element in the list `b`.

Since the specific elements of the list `b` are not provided, we can only say that `b[3]` is the fourth element of the list `b`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the fourth element of the list `b` without any trailing newline character because `end=''` is specified.

Output: **b[3] (where b[3] is the fourth element of the list b)**
