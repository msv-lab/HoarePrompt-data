Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from the password string and must have at least one digit; `letters` is a sorted list containing all the letters from the password string. The current index `i` satisfies `i < len(digits) - 1` and `digits[i] > digits[i + 1]`.**
