Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from the `password` string and must have at least one digit; `letters` is a sorted list containing all the letters from the `password` string; `i` is less than `len(letters)` and `digits[-1]` is greater than `letters[i]`. Additionally, either `i` is not less than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is not greater than `digits[i + 1]`.**
