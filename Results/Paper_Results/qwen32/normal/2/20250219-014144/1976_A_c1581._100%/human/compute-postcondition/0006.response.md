Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is a list containing the current character (`char`); the current character (`char`) is not a digit.**

Explanation: The code appends the current character (`char`) to the `letters` list. The `password`, `digits`, and the condition that `char` is not a digit remain unchanged.
