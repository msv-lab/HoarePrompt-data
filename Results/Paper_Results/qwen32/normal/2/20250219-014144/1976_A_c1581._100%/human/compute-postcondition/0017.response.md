The code sorts the `digits` list. This means that the order of elements in the `digits` list will be rearranged in ascending order. The `password`, `letters`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; digits is a sorted list containing all the digits from the password string; letters is a list containing all the letters from the password string.**
