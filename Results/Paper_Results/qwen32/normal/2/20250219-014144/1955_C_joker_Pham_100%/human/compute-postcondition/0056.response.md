To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `l <= r`.

Given the loop condition:
```python
while l <= r:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `l` is still less than or equal to `r`.

Let's analyze the possible states at the end of the previous iteration:

- `l` and `r` are indices used to traverse the list `a`.
- The loop modifies `l` and `r` based on certain conditions within the loop body.

From the problem description, we know:
- If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1.
- If `a[l] == 0`, then `l` is incremented by 1.
- If `k == a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and the loop breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.
- If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, no changes are made to `sunks`, `l`, or `r`.

Since we are only concerned with the loop condition `l <= r`, we need to ensure that after any modifications within the loop, `l` remains less than or equal to `r`.

### Example Adjustment:
If at the end of the previous iteration, `l` was equal to `r`, the loop would terminate. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `l` or `r` such that `l <= r` holds true.

#### Case Analysis:
1. **If `l` was equal to `r`:**
   - We can decrement `r` by 1 to ensure `l < r`.
   
2. **If `l` was greater than `r`:**
   - This scenario should not occur because the loop would have already terminated. However, if it did, we would need to adjust `l` to be less than or equal to `r`.

3. **If `l` was less than `r`:**
   - No adjustment is needed as the loop can continue executing.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `l` is equal to `r`, we can decrement `r` by 1 to satisfy the condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. If `l` is equal to `r`, then `r` must be decremented by 1 to ensure `l <= r`. Otherwise, no adjustment is needed.**
