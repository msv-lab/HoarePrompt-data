The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or conditions unless those are explicitly modified before the `continue` statement.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `k`, `l`, `r`, `sunks`) are being modified by the `continue` statement itself. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]` and each integer `a_i` (for i ≠ l) satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `k` is now `k - a[r] * 2`; `l` and `r` remain unchanged unless previously adjusted; if `a[l] == 0`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1; `sunks` is incremented by 1; `r` is decremented by 1.**
