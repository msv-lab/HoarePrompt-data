To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `l <= r`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `k` is some integer used in the loop body.
- `l` and `r` are indices into the list `a`.
- `sunks` is a counter that gets incremented under certain conditions.

The loop condition is `l <= r`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

### Analysis:
- If `l > r` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute again.
- To ensure the loop executes again, we need to adjust `l` and/or `r` such that `l <= r`.

### Adjustment:
- If `l` is currently greater than `r`, we can decrement `l` by 1 or increment `r` by 1 to ensure `l <= r`.
- Since we are only allowed to adjust the variables in the loop head (`l` and `r`), these are the only changes we can make.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `l` is greater than `r`, we can adjust either `l` or `r` accordingly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` must be less than or equal to `r`**
