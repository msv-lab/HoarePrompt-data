Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `a[l] <= a[r]`, and `k >= a[l] * 2`, then `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`, and if `a[r]` becomes 0, `k` is now `k - 2 * a[l]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `r` is decremented by 1; otherwise, no changes are made to `k`, `sunks`, or `r`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1, `l` is incremented by 1. If `k < a[l] * 2`, then if `k` equals 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, if `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[l] > a[r]`, no changes are made to `a`, `k`, `sunks`, `l`, or `r`.**
