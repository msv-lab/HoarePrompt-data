Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `sunks` is 0**
