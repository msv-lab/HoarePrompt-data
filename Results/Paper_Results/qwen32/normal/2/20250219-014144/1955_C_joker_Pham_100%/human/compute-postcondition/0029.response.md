Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is either 0 or an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` is equal to `r` or `l` is less than `r`, `r` is `n - 1`. Additionally, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`. `a[l] * 2 - 1` is not equal to `k`. If `l` equals `r` and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The conditions and constraints on the variables are still valid as described in the initial state.
