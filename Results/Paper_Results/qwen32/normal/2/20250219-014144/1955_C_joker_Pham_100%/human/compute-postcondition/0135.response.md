Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`), `k` (an integer representing a threshold value), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). The function performs a series of operations based on these inputs and returns the total number of successful operations, denoted by `sunks`.**
