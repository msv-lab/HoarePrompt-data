Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `sunks` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. If `a[r] < a[l]`, then if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. If `a[l]` is equal to 0, `l` is also incremented by 1. If `k` is equal to `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and in either case, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, no changes are made to `sunks`, `l`, or `r`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`, `k` is now `k - a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and if `a[l] == 0`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 again and `l` is incremented by 1; `r` is decremented by 1. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k < a[r] * 2`, then if `a[r] * 2 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the loop breaks; otherwise, the loop breaks without changing any variables. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, no changes are made to `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, or `sunks`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k < a[r] * 2`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and if `a[r] * 2 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, no changes are made to `k`, `sunks`, `a`, `l`, or `r`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
