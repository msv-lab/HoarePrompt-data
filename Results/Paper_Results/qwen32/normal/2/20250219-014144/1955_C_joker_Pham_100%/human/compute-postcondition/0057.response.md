Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. If `l` is equal to `r`, then `r` must be decremented by 1 to ensure `l <= r`. Otherwise, no adjustment is needed. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
