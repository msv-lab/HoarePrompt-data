Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is either 0 or an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`; `sunks` is 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It only causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
