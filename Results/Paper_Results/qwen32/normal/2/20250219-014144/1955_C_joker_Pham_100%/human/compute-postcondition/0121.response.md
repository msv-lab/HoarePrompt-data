Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 (with the specific modification that `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`), and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` must be less than or equal to `r`; `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`; `sunks` is incremented by 1; `l` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
