The value of `k` is decremented by `a[r] * 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` must be less than or equal to `r`; `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`.**
