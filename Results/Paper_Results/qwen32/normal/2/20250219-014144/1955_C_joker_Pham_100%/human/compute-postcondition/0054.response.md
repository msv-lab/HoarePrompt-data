Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. If `a[l]` is equal to 0, `l` is also incremented by 1. If `k` is equal to `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. In either case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
