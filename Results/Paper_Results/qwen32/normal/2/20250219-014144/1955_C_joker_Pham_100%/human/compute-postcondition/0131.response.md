Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k < a[r] * 2`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and if `a[r] * 2 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, no changes are made to `k`, `sunks`, `a`, `l`, or `r`.**
