The code snippet increments the variable `tot` by 1. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged unless the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, which is contingent upon the condition `num[i] != '0'`. Since the code provided does not include any conditional statements or loops that could alter `num` or `i`, only `tot` is modified.

Given that `tot` was initially 2, after executing `tot += 1`, `tot` becomes 3. The conditions regarding `num` and `i` remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that `1 <= int(num) <= 10^9`, `tot` is 3, and `i` is `len(num) - 3`. If `num[i]` is not '0', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes occur to `num`, `tot`, or `i`.**
