Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that `1 <= int(num) <= 10^9`, `tot` is 2, `i` is `len(num) - 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `num`, `tot`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without altering the values of the variables.
