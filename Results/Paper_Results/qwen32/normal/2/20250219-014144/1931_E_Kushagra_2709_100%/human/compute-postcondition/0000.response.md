Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= int(num) <= 10^9.**

Explanation: The variable `num` was originally an integer within the range 1 to 10^9. After the code `num = str(num)` is executed, `num` is now a string that represents the same integer value. The precondition about the range of the original integer value is still valid but now applies to the integer value of the string `num`.
