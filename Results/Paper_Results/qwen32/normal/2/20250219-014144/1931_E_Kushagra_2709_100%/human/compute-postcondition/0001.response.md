The code initializes a new variable `tot` to 0. This does not affect the existing variable `num`. Therefore, the output state includes `num` remaining unchanged as a string representation of an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `tot` being set to 0.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 <= int(num) <= 10^9; `tot` is 0**.
