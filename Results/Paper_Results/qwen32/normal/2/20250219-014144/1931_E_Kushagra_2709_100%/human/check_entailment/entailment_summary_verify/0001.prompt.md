You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, nums):

    tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'

#Function 2:
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        tot += 1
    return tot



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function takes an integer `num` (where 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9) and returns the count of trailing zeros in its decimal representation.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number, removing leading zeros.
   - Sasha concatenates two numbers in any order and replaces them with the concatenated result.
   - The game ends when only one number remains.
   - Sasha wins if the final number is at least \(10^m\).

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the winner if both players play optimally.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
- `func_1(n, m, nums)`: This function determines the winner based on the input parameters.
- `zerocnts(num)`: This helper function counts the trailing zeros in a number.

#### Function `zerocnts(num)`:
- Converts the number to a string.
- Iterates from the end of the string to count trailing zeros.
- Returns the count of trailing zeros.

#### Function `func_1(n, m, nums)`:
- Computes the total length of all numbers in the list after converting them to strings.
- Sorts the numbers based on the count of trailing zeros in descending order.
- Iteratively subtracts the count of trailing zeros from every other number starting from the first (i.e., indices 0, 2, 4, ...).
- Checks if the remaining total length is at least \(m + 1\). If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Evaluation:
1. **Trailing Zeros**:
   - The logic considers the removal of trailing zeros during Anna's turn. However, reversing the digits of a number might not necessarily remove trailing zeros (e.g., reversing 100 results in 1, but reversing 1000 results in 1).

2. **Concatenation Strategy**:
   - Sasha's strategy involves concatenating numbers. The provided solution does not account for the optimal way Sasha can concatenate numbers to maximize the final number's length.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - The solution assumes that removing trailing zeros from every other number (starting from the first) is optimal for Sasha. This assumption may not hold true in all scenarios.

4. **Total Length Calculation**:
   - The total length calculation is based on the initial lengths of the numbers minus the trailing zeros of every other number. This approach does not consider the impact of concatenation on the final number's length.

### Conclusion:
Given the above points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for both players. It simplifies the problem by focusing solely on the removal of trailing zeros, which is not sufficient to determine the winner accurately.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
