Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- We have a grid of size 5x3, which means each screen has 15 cells.
- There are two types of icons: 
  - 1x1 icons that occupy 1 cell each.
  - 2x2 icons that occupy 4 cells each.
- The goal is to minimize the number of screens required to fit all the icons.

### Key Observations:
1. **Maximizing 2x2 Icons**: Since 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells, placing them first will help maximize space utilization.
2. **Remaining Space**: After placing as many 2x2 icons as possible, we need to place the remaining 1x1 icons.
3. **Screen Utilization**: Each screen has 15 cells. If we use up 4 cells with a 2x2 icon, we have 11 cells left. If we use up another 4 cells with another 2x2 icon, we have 7 cells left, and so on.

### Steps to Solve:
1. **Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons**: 
   - Each 2x2 icon needs 4 cells. So, `b` 2x2 icons will need `4*b` cells.
   - The number of screens needed just for 2x2 icons is `ceil(b / 3)` because each screen can hold at most 3 (since 3 * 4 = 12, and we need to leave some space for 1x1 icons).

2. **Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons**:
   - After placing `floor(b / 3) * 3` 2x2 icons, we might have leftover 2x2 icons (0, 1, or 2).
   - Calculate the remaining cells and see how many 1x1 icons can fit into these cells.

3. **Calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons**:
   - After placing 2x2 icons, calculate the remaining cells and determine how many screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Program Analysis:
Let's go through the provided program and see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates `t` as `ceil(b / 2)`, which is incorrect. It should be `ceil(b / 3)` because each screen can hold at most 3 2x2 icons.
   
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Cells**:
   - The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is incorrect. This does not correctly account for the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.
   
3. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the remaining 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
