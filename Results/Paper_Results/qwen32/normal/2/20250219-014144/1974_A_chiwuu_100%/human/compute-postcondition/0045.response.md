Output State: **`a` is an integer; `b` is an integer representing the second input value; `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `i_end + 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` has been updated to `b // 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
