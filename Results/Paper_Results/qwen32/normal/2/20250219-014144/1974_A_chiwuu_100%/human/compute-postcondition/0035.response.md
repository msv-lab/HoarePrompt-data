To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given Initial State:
- `a` is an integer
- `b` are the new values provided by the input
- `t` is either `b // 2` if `t % 2 == 0` or `(b // 2) + 1` if `t % 2 != 0`
- `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99
- `n` is greater than 0
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`
- `i` is `i_end + 1`
- `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`

Code Snippet:
```python
t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
```

Impact Analysis:
- The value of `t` is being updated based on its current value, `t2 // 15`, and a constant `1`.

New Value of `t`:
- `t_new = t + t2 // 15 + 1`

Other Variables:
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `t1`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` are the new values provided by the input, `t` is `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 0, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`**

In natural language: The value of `t` is updated to be its original value plus the integer division of `t2` by 15 plus 1. All other variables retain their original values.
