The provided code snippet only includes the line `a, b = input().split()`, which reads two values from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means that the values of `a` and `b` will be updated to the new values provided by the input. However, the types of `a` and `b` after this operation will be strings, as `input()` returns a string and `split()` splits the string into parts without converting them to integers.

The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `t1`, `i`, `i_end`, `t2`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing the first input value, `b` is a string representing the second input value; `t` is either `b // 2` if `t % 2 == 0` or `(b // 2) + 1` if `t % 2 != 0`, unless updated as specified; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `i_end + 2`.**
