Let's break down the initial state and the calculations step by step to determine the final value of `t` that will be printed.

1. **Initial Calculation of `t`:**
   - `t` is initially set to the value of `b` divided by 2 using integer division (`t = b // 2`).
   - If `t` was originally even, it remains even; otherwise, it is incremented by 1. This means if `b // 2` is odd, we add 1 to make it even.

2. **Calculation of `t1`:**
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

3. **Conditional Update of `t`:**
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, then:
     - `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`.
     - If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

Given these steps, let's describe the final value of `t`:

- `t` starts as `b // 2`, adjusted to be even if necessary.
- Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, `t` may be updated based on the calculations involving `t1` and `t2`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `t`. However, we can describe the process and the final value of `t` based on the given conditions.

Output: **t (where t is calculated based on the initial value of b, adjusted to be even, and potentially updated based on the values of a and b through the calculations involving t1 and t2)**
