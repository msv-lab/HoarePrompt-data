Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b`, the number of 2x2 icons.
   - It then calculates how many full screens are needed to accommodate these 2x2 icons:
     - If `b` is even, `t` is set to `b // 2` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and 15 cells (3x5 grid) can fit at most 3 such icons.
     - If `b` is odd, `t` is set to `(b // 2) + 1` to account for the remaining 2x2 icon that doesn't fill up a full set of 3.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons.
     - `t * 15` is the total number of cells used by the screens allocated for 2x2 icons.
     - `b * 4` is the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.
     - The difference `t * 15 - b * 4` gives the remaining free cells.

4. **Accommodating 1x1 Icons**:
   - If `t1` (remaining cells) is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `t2` is the number of additional 1x1 icons that need placement (`a - t1`).
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, exactly `t2 // 15` additional screens are needed.
     - If `t2` is not divisible by 15, an additional screen is needed for the remaining icons (`t2 // 15 + 1`).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens `t` required for each test case.

### Verification Against Test Cases

Let's verify the program against the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
   - 1x1: 1, 2x2: 1
   - 1 screen for 2x2, 1 remaining cell which fits the 1x1.
   - Output: `1`

2. **Test Case 2**: `7 2`
   - 1x1: 7, 2x2: 2
   - 1 screen for 2x2, 7 remaining cells which fit the 7x1.
   - Output: `1`

3. **Test Case 3**: `12 4`
   - 1x1: 12, 2x2: 4
   - 2 screens for 2x2, 2 remaining cells which don't fit the 12x1.
   - 12 - 2 = 10 remaining 1x1 icons, needing 1 additional screen.
   - Total: 3 screens.
   - However, the optimal solution would be 2 screens (3 2x2 and 3 1x1 per screen).
   - Output: `2` (Incorrect according to optimal solution)

### Conclusion

Upon closer inspection, the program does not always produce the optimal solution. Specifically, the logic for fitting 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons can sometimes result in suboptimal screen usage.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
