To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variable `t` evolves with each iteration. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Loop Iteration Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is initialized as an integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - For each test case, there are two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99).
   - `n` is the number of iterations the loop will perform.

2. **Loop Body**:
   - For each iteration `i` in the range `n`:
     - Read two integers `a` and `b`.
     - Update `t` to `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd.
     - Calculate `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
     - If `t1` is less than `a`, calculate `t2` as `a - t1`.
       - If `t2` is divisible by 15, update `t` to `t + t2 // 15`.
       - Otherwise, update `t` to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.
     - Print the current value of `t`.

### Final Output State

After `n` iterations, the final value of `t` will be determined by the last set of inputs `a` and `b` processed in the loop. The value of `t` will be updated based on the logic described above for the last iteration.

### Conclusion

The final output state is simply the value of `t` after the last iteration of the loop, given the inputs `a` and `b` for that iteration. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged throughout the loop and do not affect the value of `t`.

### Output State

Output State: **the value of `t` after processing the last pair of `a` and `b` in the `n`th iteration.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is the value of `t` after the loop has completed all `n` iterations, which is determined by the last input pair `a` and `b`.
