The code snippet assigns the value of `b` to `t`. This means that the previous value of `t` (which was `b` divided by 2 using integer division, and possibly adjusted based on its parity) is replaced by the new value of `b`.

Given this, the new value of `t` is simply `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` are the new values provided by the input; `t` is now the value of `b`; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `i_end + 1`.**
