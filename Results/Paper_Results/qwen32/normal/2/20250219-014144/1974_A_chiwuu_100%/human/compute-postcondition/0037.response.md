Postcondition: **`a` is an integer, `b` are the new values provided by the input; `t` is either `b // 2` if `t % 2 == 0` or `(b // 2) + 1` if `t % 2 != 0`, unless updated as specified; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `i_end + 1`. If `t1 >= a`, no further changes are made to `t`. If `t1 < a`, then if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, and `t2` remains `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.**
