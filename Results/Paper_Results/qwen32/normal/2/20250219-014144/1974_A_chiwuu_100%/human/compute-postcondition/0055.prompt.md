Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b
    if t % 2 == 0:
        t = t // 2
    else:
        t = t // 2 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is now the value of `b` divided by 2 using integer division, and if `t` was originally even, it remains even; otherwise, it is incremented by 1. `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `a`; `b` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `b`; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made to `t`. Otherwise, `t` is updated based on whether `t2` (calculated as `a - t1`) is divisible by 15. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an integer, `b` are the new values provided by the input; `t` is either `b // 2` if `t % 2 == 0` or `(b // 2) + 1` if `t % 2 != 0`, unless updated as specified; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `i_end + 1`. If `t1 >= a`, no further changes are made to `t`. If `t1 < a`, then if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, and `t2` remains `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer representing the second input value; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i_end + 2`. If `t1 >= a`, then `t` and `t1` remain as initially calculated. Otherwise, if `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is recalculated based on whether `b % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 != 0`, and `t1` remains unchanged. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1`, and `t1` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
