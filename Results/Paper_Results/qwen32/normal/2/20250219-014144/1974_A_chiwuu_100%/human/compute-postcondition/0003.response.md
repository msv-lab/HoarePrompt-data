The code snippet provided attempts to convert the string `a` into an integer. This means that the value of `a` must be a string representation of a number for the conversion to be successful. Given the initial state, `a` and `b` are strings obtained from the split input, and now `a` is being converted to an integer.

Since `a` was originally a string and is now being converted to an integer, its type changes. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this conversion.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `a`; `b` is a string.**
