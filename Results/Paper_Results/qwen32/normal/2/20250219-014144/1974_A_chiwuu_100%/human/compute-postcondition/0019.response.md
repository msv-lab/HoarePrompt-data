Given the initial conditions and the code snippet provided, let's determine the new state of the variables.

The code snippet modifies the variable `t` based on the current values of `t` and `t2`. Here's the updated state:

- `t` is initially defined as `b // 2` (integer division), and if it was originally even, it remains even; otherwise, it is incremented by 1.
- `t2` is defined as `a - t1`, and it is not divisible by 15.
- The code updates `t` to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.

Since `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t2 // 15` will be an integer representing the floor division of `t2` by 15, which means it will be an integer less than `t2 / 15`.

Therefore, the new value of `t` will be its original value plus the integer division of `t2` by 15, plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `a`; `b` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `b`; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`; `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, and `t2` is not divisible by 15.**
