The code snippet provided only includes the line `a, b = input().split()`, which means that the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the user input. The input is expected to be two space-separated strings, which will be converted to the variables `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state, the values of `a` and `b` were previously integers derived from converting some original strings. After executing the provided line of code, `a` and `b` will be reassigned to the new values provided by the input.

The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `t1`, `i`, `i_end`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the provided line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are the new values provided by the input; `t` is now the value of `b` divided by 2 using integer division, and if `t` was originally even, it remains even; otherwise, it is incremented by 1; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` is greater than 0; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `i_end + 1`.**
