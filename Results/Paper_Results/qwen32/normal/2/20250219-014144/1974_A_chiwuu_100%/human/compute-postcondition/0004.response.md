The code snippet provided attempts to convert the string `b` into an integer. This means that `b` must contain a valid integer representation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- For each of the t test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `a` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `a`
- `b` is a string

After executing the line `b = int(b)`, the variable `b` is no longer a string but an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each of the t test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `a`; `b` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `b`.**
