The code modifies the value of `t` by performing an integer division by 2 and then adding 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` are the new values provided by the input.
- `t` is now the value of `b`.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `i` is `i_end + 1`.

After executing `t = t // 2 + 1`, the value of `t` changes to `(b // 2) + 1`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` are the new values provided by the input, `t` is `(b // 2) + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, `n` is greater than 0, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is `i_end + 1`.**
