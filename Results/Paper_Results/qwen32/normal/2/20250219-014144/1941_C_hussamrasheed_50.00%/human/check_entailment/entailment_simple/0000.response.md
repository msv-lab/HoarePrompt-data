### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the given string `s`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. **Counting Substrings**:
   - It counts the number of occurrences of the substring "map" in the string `s` and stores this count in `m`.
   - It removes all occurrences of "map" from the string `s`.
   - It then counts the number of occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` and stores this count in `p`.
3. **Calculating Output**: The program outputs the sum of `m` and `p`, which represents the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

However, there is a critical flaw in this approach. Removing all occurrences of "map" before counting "pie" can lead to incorrect results because the removal of "map" might create new occurrences of "pie" that were not present originally. For example, consider the string "mappie". After removing "map", the string becomes "pie", which incorrectly contributes to the count of "pie".

### Example:
Let's take the string "mappie":
- Initial string: "mappie"
- Count of "map": 1
- After removing "map": "pie"
- Count of "pie": 1
- Total deletions: 2 (incorrect)

The correct approach should involve checking for both "map" and "pie" without modifying the original string. A more accurate method would be to use dynamic programming or another technique to find the minimum deletions required to avoid both substrings.

### Conclusion:
Given the flaw in the logic, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
