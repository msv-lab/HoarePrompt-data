### Reasoning:

The provided code aims to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the given string `s` and then printing the total count of these occurrences for each test case. However, the approach taken by the code is flawed because simply counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" does not necessarily give the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

To illustrate why this approach is incorrect, consider the following example:

Suppose the string `s` is `"mpaip"`. The code would count one occurrence of "map" and one occurrence of "pie" after removing "map", resulting in a total of 2 deletions. However, the optimal solution would be to remove only 1 character (either 'a' or 'i') to make the string beautiful, since removing either of these characters would eliminate both "map" and "pie".

The correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of deletions required to ensure neither "map" nor "pie" appears in the string. The current implementation fails to achieve this.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **False**
