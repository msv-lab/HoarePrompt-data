The code snippet updates the value of `p` to be the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is 0, `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`.**
