Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. The current implementation simply counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string, removes "map" occurrences, and then counts "pie" occurrences again. This approach does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to achieve the desired result.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
7
pmappie
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
- The string "pmappie" contains both "map" and "pie".
- To make the string beautiful, we can remove the 'm' from "map" and the 'p' from "pie", resulting in "paie" which does not contain either "map" or "pie".

However, the provided program would output `2` because it counts one "map" and one "pie", but it does not ensure that these removals are optimal or do not overlap in a way that could allow fewer deletions.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
