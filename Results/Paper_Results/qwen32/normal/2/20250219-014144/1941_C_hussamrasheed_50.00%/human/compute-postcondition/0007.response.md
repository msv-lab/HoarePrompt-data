To determine what will be printed by the `print(m + p)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed:

1. **Input Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 (This variable is not used in the given code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output).
   - `n`: An input integer (This variable is also not used in the given code snippet, so it doesn't affect the output).
   - `s`: An input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
   - `m`: The number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`.
   - `p`: The number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`.

2. **Operations Performed:**
   - `s` is the original input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
   - `m` counts how many times 'map' was found in the original string `s`.
   - `p` counts how many times 'pie' appears in the modified string `s` (after 'map' has been removed).

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(m + p)` statement sums the count of 'map' occurrences (`m`) in the original string and the count of 'pie' occurrences (`p`) in the modified string.

Given these details, the output will be the sum of two counts:
- `m`: The number of times 'map' appeared in the original string.
- `p`: The number of times 'pie' appeared in the modified string (after removing all 'map').

Therefore, the output will be the sum of these two counts.

Output: **m + p (where m is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original string, and p is the number of times 'pie' appeared in the modified string after removing all 'map')**
