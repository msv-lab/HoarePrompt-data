Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is now assigned the value of an integer input, which falls within the range of 1 to 10,000. The conditions for `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they are described in the context of each test case that will follow.
