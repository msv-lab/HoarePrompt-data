The code snippet `pl.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the end of the list `pl`. This means that the list `pl` will now include the integer `i` as its last element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned); `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer; `pl` is a list that now contains the integer `i` as its last element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` either has a value of `1` (if it did not exist before) or its existing value is incremented by `1`; `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the previously processed element.**
