Output State: **`shapes` is 0, `w` has been decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `pl` now includes `i` as its last element, `d` has `i` mapped to `1` if `i` was not previously in `d`; otherwise, `d[i]` is now `d[i] + 1`.**

In simple terms: The list `pl` now contains the element `i` at the end. The dictionary `d` has updated its count for `i`: if `i` was not already in `d`, it is now mapped to `1`; if `i` was already in `d`, its count has been increased by `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
