The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. This means that the dictionary `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the dictionary `d`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `shapes`) retain their original values or states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned); `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is a dictionary containing the key `i` with the value `1`; `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`.**
