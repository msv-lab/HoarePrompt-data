In the given for loop:

```python
for i in palka:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the iterable is `palka`. For the loop to execute, `palka` must contain at least one element. The other variables mentioned (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, `pl`, and `d`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `palka` must be a list with at least one integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary**
