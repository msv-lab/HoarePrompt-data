The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `palka`. This operation does not affect the variables `shapes`, `w`, or `ln`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more, `w` is decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input.**
