Output State: **`shapes` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether the count of integer `j_next` in the dictionary `d` was initially less than 3 or greater than or equal to 3, respectively; `w` has been decreased by 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer; `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must contain at least one integer; `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer in `palka`; `j` is the next element in `pl` after the current `j`.**

Explanation: The value of `shapes` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if it was initially 2, it becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
