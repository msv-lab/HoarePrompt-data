The given code snippet increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100
- `w` is `w - 1`
- `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned)
- `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer
- `pl` now contains the previously processed `i` as its last element
- `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` either has a value of `1` (if it did not exist before) or its existing value is incremented by `1`
- `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`
- `i` is the next element in `palka` after the previously processed element

The line `d[i] += 1` modifies the dictionary `d` by incrementing the value associated with the key `i`. If `i` was not already a key in `d`, it will be added with a value of 1. If `i` was already a key, its value will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the updated state of `d` will reflect this change. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned); `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer; `pl` now contains the previously processed `i` as its last element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has its value incremented by 1; `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the previously processed element.**
