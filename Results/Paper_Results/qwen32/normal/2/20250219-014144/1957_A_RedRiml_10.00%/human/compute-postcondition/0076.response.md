The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. For the loop to execute one more time, `pl` must have at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was set to `j_next`.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should be updated to the next element in `pl`.

State: **`d[j_next]` is an integer. If `d[j_next]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `shapes` is increased by 1. `j` is the next element in `pl`.**
