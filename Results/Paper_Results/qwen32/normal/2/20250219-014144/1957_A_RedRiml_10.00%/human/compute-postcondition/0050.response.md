The given code snippet modifies the dictionary `d` by incrementing the value associated with the key `i` by 1. Here's the updated state of the variables after executing the code:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- For each test case, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains unchanged.
- `w` remains `w - 1`.
- `ln` remains the newly assigned input integer.
- `palka` remains the list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer.
- `pl` remains an empty list.
- `d` is updated such that the value associated with the key `i` is incremented by 1.
- `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned); `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `i` is incremented by 1; `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`.**
