The given code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. This means that if `i` was not already a key in `d`, it will now be with a value of `1`. If `i` was already a key in `d`, its value will be overwritten to `1`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that is directly impacted by the line `d[i] = 1` is the dictionary `d`. All other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned); `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the integer `i` (it contains `i` if `i` was not already in `pl` before the if statement); `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value of `1`; `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the previously processed element**.
