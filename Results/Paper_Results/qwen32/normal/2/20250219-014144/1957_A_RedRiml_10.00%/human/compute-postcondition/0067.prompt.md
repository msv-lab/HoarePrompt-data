Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned); `palka` is a list of integers read from the input; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary; `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned); `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the integer `i` (it contains `i` if `i` was not already in `pl` before the if statement); `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` either has a value of `1` (if it did not exist before) or its existing value is incremented by `1`; `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer (newly assigned); `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer; if `i` was not in `pl`, `pl` now contains `i` as its last element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` either has a value of `1` (if it did not exist before) or its existing value is incremented by `1`; `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the previously processed element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer; `pl` now contains the previously processed `i` and, if `i` was not already in `pl`, it also contains the current `i` as its last element; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` either has a value of `1` (if it did not exist before) or its existing value is incremented by `1`; `shapes` need to be recalculated based on the new `palka`; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the previously processed element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
