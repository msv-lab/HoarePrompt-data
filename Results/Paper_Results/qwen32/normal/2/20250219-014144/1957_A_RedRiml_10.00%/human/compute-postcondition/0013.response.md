The code snippet `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `pl` did not contain `i` initially, after this operation, `pl` will contain `i` as its last element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `pl` is a list that now contains `i` as its last element; `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, then `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. The current value of `i` is not in `pl` (prior to appending).**
