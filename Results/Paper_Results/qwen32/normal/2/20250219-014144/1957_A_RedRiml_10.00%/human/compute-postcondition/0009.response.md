Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is a dictionary and `d.get(i)` is not None**
