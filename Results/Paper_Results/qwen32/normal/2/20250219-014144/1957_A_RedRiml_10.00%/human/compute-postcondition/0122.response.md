Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. The function processes each test case and returns the result for each one.**
