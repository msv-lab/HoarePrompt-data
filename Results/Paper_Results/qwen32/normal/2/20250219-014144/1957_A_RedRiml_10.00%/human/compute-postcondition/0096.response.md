The code assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. This means that the dictionary `d` now includes the key `i` with the value `1`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `shapes` is still `0`.
- `w` has been decreased by `1` (though its exact value is not specified).
- `ln` is still an input integer.
- `palka` is still a list of integers from the input with at least 2 integers.
- `i` is still the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.
- `pl` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`shapes` is 0, `w` has been decreased by 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`, `d` is a dictionary with `i` mapped to `1`, `pl` remains unchanged.**
