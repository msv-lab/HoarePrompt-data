The code snippet `r.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `r`. This means that the list `r` now contains one element, which is `0`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is 0; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a == 2`; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a == 1`; `cx` is a set of unique `x` values when `a` is neither 1 nor 2; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop and now includes `[0]`; `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`.**
