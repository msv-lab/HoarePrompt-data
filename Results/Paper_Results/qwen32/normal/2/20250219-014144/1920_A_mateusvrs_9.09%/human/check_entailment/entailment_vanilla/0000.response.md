Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then processes each constraint.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - The program initializes `cx` as an empty set to store values that `k` cannot be (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the upper bound for `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to `-1` to represent the lower bound for `k` (type 1 constraints).
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and the given `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and the given `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx >= ax`. If this condition is true, it means there are no integers `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds simultaneously, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - If `bx < ax`, it calculates the number of integers `k` that can satisfy all constraints:
     - It initializes `tmp` to `0` to count how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
     - It iterates through the set `cx` and increments `tmp` for each value that lies within `[bx, ax]`.
     - Finally, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` and appends this value to the result list `r`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Analysis:

- The logic for determining the bounds (`bx` and `ax`) and checking for feasibility (`bx >= ax`) is correct.
- The calculation of the number of valid integers `k` is also correct. It correctly subtracts the number of excluded values (`tmp`) from the total possible values in the range `[bx, ax]`.
- The program handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description, such as when there are no valid integers `k` due to conflicting bounds.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
