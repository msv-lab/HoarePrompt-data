The given code snippet initializes `cx` as an empty set. This means that any previous contents of `cx` are discarded, and it starts fresh as an empty set. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, and `r`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 498; `n` is the input integer; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered; `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop.**
