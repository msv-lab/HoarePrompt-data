Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the single element `x`.
- `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.
- `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1.
- `a` and `x` are the two integers read from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
bx = max(x, bx)
```

### Impact Analysis:
- The code updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current value of `bx`.

### Calculation:
- If `a` is 1, initially `bx` was `max(x, -1)`. After the code, `bx` remains `max(x, max(x, -1))`, which simplifies to `x` because `x` is always greater than or equal to `max(x, -1)`.
- If `a` is not 1, initially `bx` was `-1`. After the code, `bx` becomes `max(x, -1)`, which is `x` if `x` is greater than or equal to `-1`. Since `x` is an integer read from the input and there is no restriction that `x` must be less than `-1`, we assume `x` is non-negative (as it is common for such problems).

### Output State:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `cx` remains an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the single element `x`.
- `ax` remains 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.
- `bx` is updated to `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, which simplifies to `x`. If `a` is not 1, `bx` is updated to `max(x, -1)`, which is `x` if `x` is non-negative.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is greater than 0; `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the single element `x`; `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007; `bx` is `x`.**
