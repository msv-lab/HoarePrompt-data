Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is the total number of iterations; `cx` is a set containing at least one element; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` where `a` was 2; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` where `a` was 1; `bx` is less than `ax`; `i` is an element from `cx` that hasn't been iterated over yet. If `i` is such that `bx` ≤ `i` ≤ `ax`, then `tmp` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.**
