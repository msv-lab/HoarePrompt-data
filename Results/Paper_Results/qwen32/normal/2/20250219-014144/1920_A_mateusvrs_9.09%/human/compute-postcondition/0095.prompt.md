Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is 0; `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values added when `a` was 3; `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered; `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop; `bx` is less than `ax`; `tmp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing at least one element, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered, `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop, `bx` is less than `ax`, and `tmp` is 1 if `i` is an integer such that `i` ≥ `bx` and `i` ≤ `ax`; otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing at least one element, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered, `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the next element from `cx`. If `i` is an integer such that `i` ≥ `bx` and `i` ≤ `ax`, `tmp` is 2; otherwise, `tmp` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499, `n` is 0, `cx` is a set containing at least one element, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered, `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop, `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the next element from `cx` (denoted as `i_next`). If `i_next` is an integer such that `i_next` ≥ `bx` and `i_next` ≤ `ax`, `tmp` is 3; otherwise, `tmp` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
