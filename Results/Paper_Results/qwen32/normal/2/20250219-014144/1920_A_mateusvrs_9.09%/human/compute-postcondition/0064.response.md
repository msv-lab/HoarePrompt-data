Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0; `cx` is a set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is not equal to 1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` contains `x` and `a` is not equal to 2.**
