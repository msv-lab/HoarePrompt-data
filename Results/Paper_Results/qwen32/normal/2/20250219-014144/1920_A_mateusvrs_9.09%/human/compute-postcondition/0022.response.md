The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Given the initial conditions, if `a` is either 1 or 2, `cx` starts as an empty set. Otherwise, `cx` contains the single element `x`. After executing `cx.add(x)`, `cx` will definitely contain `x`.

Let's summarize the changes:
- If `a` is 1 or 2, `cx` was initially an empty set and now contains `x`.
- If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` already contained `x` and remains unchanged.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is greater than 1; `cx` is a set containing the single element `x`; `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` (from input) is 1 or if `a` (from input) is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` (from input) and 1000000007; `bx` is `max(x` (from input)`, -1)` if `a` (from input) is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the two integers read from the input.**
