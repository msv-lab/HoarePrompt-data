The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` must be greater than 0; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the two integers read from the input.**
