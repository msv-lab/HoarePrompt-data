The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This affects the values of `a` and `x` but does not change the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `r`, and `tmp`).

Given the initial state, the only changes are to `a` and `x`, which are now set to the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0; `cx` is a set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is either `x` if `a` equals 1, or -1 otherwise; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input.**
