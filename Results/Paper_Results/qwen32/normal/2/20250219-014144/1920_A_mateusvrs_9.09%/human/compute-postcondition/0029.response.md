The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Given the initial conditions, we need to consider the different cases for `a`:

1. If `a` is 1 or 2, `cx` is initially an empty set. After adding `x`, `cx` will contain the single element `x`.
2. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` initially contains the single element `x`. Adding `x` again does not change the set since sets do not allow duplicate elements.

The values of `t`, `n`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- If `a` is 1 or 2, `cx` becomes `{x}`.
- If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` remains `{x}`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is greater than 0; `cx` is a set containing the single element `x`; `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1 or not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007; `bx` is `max(x, -1)` if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the two integers read from the input.**
