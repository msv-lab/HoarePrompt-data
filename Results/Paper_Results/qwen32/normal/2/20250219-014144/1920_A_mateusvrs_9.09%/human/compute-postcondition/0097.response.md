Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `n` is 0; `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values added when `a` was 3; `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered; `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered; `r` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions inside the loop. If `bx` ≥ `ax`, `r` includes an additional `0`. If `bx` < `ax`, `r` includes the newly added element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `bx ≤ i ≤ ax`.**
