To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the variables `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` evolve with each iteration based on the operations performed inside the loop.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initialization:**
  - `t`: An integer between 1 and 500 (not modified in the loop).
  - `n`: The number of iterations the loop will perform.
  - `cx`: An initially empty set.
  - `ax`: Initialized to 1000000007.
  - `bx`: Initialized to -1.

- **Loop Body:**
  - For each iteration, two integers `a` and `x` are read from the input.
  - Depending on the value of `a`:
    - If `a == 1`, update `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current value of `bx`.
    - If `a == 2`, update `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`.
    - If `a == 3`, add `x` to the set `cx`.

### Final Output State:
After all `n` iterations, the variables will reflect the cumulative effects of all operations performed within the loop:
- `t`: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `n`: Remains unchanged as it defines the number of iterations.
- `cx`: Contains all unique values of `x` that were added when `a == 3`.
- `ax`: Holds the smallest value of `x` encountered when `a == 2`.
- `bx`: Holds the largest value of `x` encountered when `a == 1`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is the total number of iterations; `cx` is a set containing all unique values of `x` where `a` was 3; `ax` is the minimum value of `x` where `a` was 2; `bx` is the maximum value of `x` where `a` was 1.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, `cx` contains all unique elements added when `a` was 3, `ax` is the smallest `x` seen when `a` was 2, and `bx` is the largest `x` seen when `a` was 1.
