You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program:
import collections
from collections import Counter
from collections import defaultdict
import math
from math import log

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    res = func_1()
    print(res)

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'
    return s[:k] * n



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, then returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` repeated `n` times.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English letters are present in `s`. The goal is to make `s` as short as possible.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it calls `func_1()`. Inside `func_1()`, it reads `n` and `k`, and then constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` letters of the alphabet and repeating this sequence `n` times.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's go through the example cases provided in the problem statement:

1. **Test Case: `n=1`, `k=2`**
   - Expected output: `ab`
   - Program output: `ab` (since `s[:2] * 1` results in `ab`)
   
2. **Test Case: `n=2`, `k=1`**
   - Expected output: `aa`
   - Program output: `aa` (since `s[:1] * 2` results in `aa`)
   
3. **Test Case: `n=2`, `k=2`**
   - Expected output: `baab`
   - Program output: `aabb` (since `s[:2] * 2` results in `aabb`)
   
4. **Test Case: `n=2`, `k=3`**
   - Expected output: `abcbac`
   - Program output: `abcabc` (since `s[:3] * 2` results in `abcabc`)

### Correctness Check:
- For `n=1` and `k=2`, the program correctly outputs `ab`, which indeed contains all subsequences of length 1 using `a` and `b`.
- For `n=2` and `k=1`, the program correctly outputs `aa`, which contains the only subsequence of length 2 using `a`.
- However, for `n=2` and `k=2`, the program outputs `aabb`, which does not contain all subsequences (`ba`). Similarly, for `n=2` and `k=3`, the program outputs `abcabc`, which does not contain all subsequences like `acb`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters are present in the generated string `s`. It simply repeats the first `k` letters `n` times, which is not sufficient to guarantee the presence of all subsequences.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
