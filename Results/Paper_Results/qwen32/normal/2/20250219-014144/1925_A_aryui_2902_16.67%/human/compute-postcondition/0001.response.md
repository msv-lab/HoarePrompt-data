The code snippet assigns the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` to the variable `s`. This assignment does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `s` is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`.**
