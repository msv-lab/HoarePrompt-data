Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `tree` is a deque, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input, `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`, `u` is not equal to `tree[0]`. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[v]`. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.**
