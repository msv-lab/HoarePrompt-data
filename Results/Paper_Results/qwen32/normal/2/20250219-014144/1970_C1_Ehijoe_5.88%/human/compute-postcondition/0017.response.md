Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `tree` is a deque containing the single element `v` at the front, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input, `v` is not equal to the first element of `tree`, and `v` is not equal to the last element of `tree`. Additionally, `u` is equal to the first element of `tree`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `tree` deque now contains one element, which is `v`, added to the front. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
