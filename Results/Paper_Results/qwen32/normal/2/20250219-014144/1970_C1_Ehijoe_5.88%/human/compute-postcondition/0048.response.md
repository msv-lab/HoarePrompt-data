The code snippet provided appends the value of `v` to the list named `tree`. This means that the list `tree` will now include the newly added element `v`.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `t`, `empty`, `u_1`, `u`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `tree` gains a new element `v`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input, `i` is 2, `tree` includes the new element `v`.**
