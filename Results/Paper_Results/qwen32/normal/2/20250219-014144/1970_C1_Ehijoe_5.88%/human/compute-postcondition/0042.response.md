The code snippet `tree.append(u)` adds the value of `u` to the end of the list `tree`. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `tree`, as `u` is appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input, `i` is 2, `u` and `v` are the new integers read from the input, `tree` now includes `u` as its last element.**
