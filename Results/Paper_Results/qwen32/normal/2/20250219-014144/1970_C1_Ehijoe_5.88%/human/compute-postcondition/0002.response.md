The provided code snippet only initializes a boolean variable `empty` to `True`. No other variables are modified or used in the snippet. Therefore, the state of the variables `n`, `t`, `tree`, and `u_1` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, and the edges are provided as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. Additionally, there is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `tree` is an empty deque. `empty` is True.**
