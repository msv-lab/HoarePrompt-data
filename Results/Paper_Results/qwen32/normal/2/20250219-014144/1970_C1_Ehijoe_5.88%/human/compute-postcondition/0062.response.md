Postcondition: **`tree` is a deque containing all nodes in the order forming a path from one leaf to the other leaf of the tree, `empty` is `False`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is `[min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]`. At least one of the elements in `moves` is odd if the if condition is met; otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even numbers.**
