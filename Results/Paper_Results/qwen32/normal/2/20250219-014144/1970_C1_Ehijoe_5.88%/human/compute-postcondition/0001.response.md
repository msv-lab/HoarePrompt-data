The provided code snippet initializes an empty deque named `tree`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the edges of the tree, or the initial node `u_1` where the stone is placed. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `tree` deque.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the input, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, and the edges are provided as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n. Additionally, there is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed. `tree` is an empty deque.**
