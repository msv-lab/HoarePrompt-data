The code snippet assigns the index of the value `start` within the deque `tree` to the variable `idx`. The values of `tree`, `empty`, and `start` remain unchanged except that `idx` is now set to the position of `start` in `tree`.

Output State: **`tree` is a deque containing all nodes in the order forming a path from one leaf to the other leaf of the tree, `empty` is `False`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**
