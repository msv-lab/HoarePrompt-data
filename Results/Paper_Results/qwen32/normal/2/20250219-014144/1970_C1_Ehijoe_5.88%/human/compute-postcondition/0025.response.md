Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `t` is an integer read from the input, the tree described by the edges has exactly two leaves, `empty` is False, `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) represents the initial node where the stone is placed, and `u` and `v` are a pair of integers read from the input. If `empty` was initially True, `tree` is now a deque containing the elements `u` and `v`. If `empty` was initially False, `tree` remains unchanged unless `u` is equal to the first element of `tree` and `v` is not equal to the first or last element of `tree`, in which case `tree` becomes a deque containing the single element `v` at the front. If `u` is equal to the last element of `tree` and `v` is not equal to the first or last element of `tree`, then `tree` contains `[v]`. In all other cases, `tree` remains unchanged.**
