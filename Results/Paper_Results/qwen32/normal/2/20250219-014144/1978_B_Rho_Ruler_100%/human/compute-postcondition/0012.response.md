To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables involved in the loop condition, which are `low` and `high`.

The loop condition is `while low <= high:`. For the loop to execute again, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Given the information about how `low` and `high` are adjusted within the loop:
- If `profit_next > profit_mid`, then `low` is set to `mid + 1`.
- Otherwise, `high` is set to `mid - 1`.

Since `mid` is recalculated as `(min(n, b)) // 2` in both cases, the exact values of `low` and `high` after each iteration depend on the comparison between `profit_next` and `profit_mid`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that after the adjustments, `low` is still less than or equal to `high`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`.
2. **Adjustments Based on Loop Body**:
   - If `profit_next > profit_mid`, `low` becomes `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `high` becomes `mid - 1`.

To guarantee that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that after these adjustments, `low` is still less than or equal to `high`.

### Ensuring Loop Continuation:

Let's consider the possible scenarios:
- If `low` is increased (`low = mid + 1`), we need to ensure that `mid + 1 <= high`.
- If `high` is decreased (`high = mid - 1`), we need to ensure that `low <= mid - 1`.

To simplify, let's assume the worst-case scenario where `low` is just about to exceed `high` after the adjustment. We need to make sure that this doesn't happen.

### Adjusting the State:

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we can adjust the state such that `low` and `high` are set in a way that guarantees `low <= high` after the next iteration.

One straightforward approach is to ensure that initially, `low` and `high` are set such that there is always room for at least one more iteration. For example, if `low` and `high` are initially set to values that allow for at least one more iteration, the loop will continue.

### Final State Adjustment:

Given the above analysis, we can set the state such that `low` and `high` are adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time. Specifically, we can set `low` to be less than `high` by ensuring that the initial values of `low` and `high` allow for at least one more iteration.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is less than `high`; `mid` is recalculated as `(min(n, b)) // 2` in both cases; `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are the results of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)` respectively; `max_profit` is updated to `max(0, profit_next)` if `profit_next` > `profit_mid`; otherwise, `max_profit` is updated to `max(0, profit_mid)`**.

This ensures that the loop condition `low <= high` is satisfied for at least one more iteration.
