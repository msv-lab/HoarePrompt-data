The code snippet updates the value of `high` to `mid - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is less than `high` - 1; `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is updated to `max(max_profit, profit_mid)`; `high` is `mid - 1`.**
