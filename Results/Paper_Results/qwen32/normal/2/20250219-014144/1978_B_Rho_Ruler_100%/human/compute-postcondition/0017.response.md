Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is updated to `mid + 1`; `high` remains unchanged; `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is updated to `max(max_profit, profit_mid)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values. The value of `mid` will be recalculated in the next iteration using the new `low` value. `profit_mid` and `profit_next` remain the results of their respective function calls, and `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `profit_mid`.
