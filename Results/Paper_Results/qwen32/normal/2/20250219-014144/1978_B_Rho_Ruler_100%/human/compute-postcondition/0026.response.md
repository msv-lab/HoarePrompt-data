Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` and `high` are integers with `low` being less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is updated to `max(max_profit, profit_mid)`; `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `high` is now set to `mid - 1`. All other variables retain their previously described properties and values.
