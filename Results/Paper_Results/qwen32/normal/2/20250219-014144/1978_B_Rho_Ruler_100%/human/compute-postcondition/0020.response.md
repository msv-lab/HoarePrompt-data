To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `low <= high`.

Given the current state:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
- `low` and `high` are integers with `low` being less than `high`.
- `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
- `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.
- `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
- `max_profit` is updated to `max(max_profit, profit_mid)`.
- If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.

The loop will continue as long as `low <= high`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `low` is still less than or equal to `high`.

Since `low` and `high` are the only variables in the loop condition, we need to adjust these variables accordingly. Specifically, we need to ensure that `low` is not greater than `high`.

Given that `mid` is recalculated and `low` or `high` is updated based on the comparison between `profit_next` and `profit_mid`, we should ensure that after the update, `low` is still less than or equal to `high`.

Here's how we can adjust the state:
- Ensure `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

Since the exact values of `low` and `high` after the previous iteration are not specified, we can assume that they were such that `low <= high` held true. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to keep this condition true.

Thus, the state should be adjusted to ensure `low <= high`.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. `low` and `high` are integers with `low` being less than or equal to `high`. `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`. `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. `max_profit` is updated to `max(max_profit, profit_mid)`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.**
