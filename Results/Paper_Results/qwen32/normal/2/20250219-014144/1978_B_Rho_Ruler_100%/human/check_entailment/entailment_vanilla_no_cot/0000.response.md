To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to verify whether the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` accurately computes the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling his buns under the given conditions.

### Analysis of the Code:

#### Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`:
- This function calculates the profit when `k` buns are sold at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
- The formula used is:
  - Profit from the first `k` buns: \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \)
  - Profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns: \( (n - k) \times a \)

This formula seems correct because:
- \( k \times b \) gives the total price if all `k` buns were sold at `b` coins.
- \( \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \) subtracts the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (which represents the discount applied to each subsequent bun).

#### Function `func_2(n, a, b)`:
- This function performs a binary search over the possible values of `k` (from `0` to `min(n, b)`) to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.
- It compares the profit at the midpoint (`mid`) with the profit at the next point (`mid + 1`) to decide which direction to move in the binary search.

This approach is efficient and correct because:
- The profit function is unimodal (first increases then decreases), making binary search an appropriate method to find the maximum.
- The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, ensuring that the maximum profit is found.

### Conclusion:
Both functions appear to be correctly implemented and logically sound. The program efficiently computes the maximum profit using binary search, which is suitable given the constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
