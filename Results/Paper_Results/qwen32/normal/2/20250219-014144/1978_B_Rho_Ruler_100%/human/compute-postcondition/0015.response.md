Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9; `low` is less than `high`; `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`; `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`; `max_profit` is updated to `max(0, profit_next)` if `profit_next` > `profit_mid`; otherwise, `max_profit` is updated to `max(0, profit_mid)`**

Explanation: The value of `profit_next` is updated to the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged. The value of `max_profit` will be updated based on the comparison between `profit_next` and `profit_mid` after this line is executed.
