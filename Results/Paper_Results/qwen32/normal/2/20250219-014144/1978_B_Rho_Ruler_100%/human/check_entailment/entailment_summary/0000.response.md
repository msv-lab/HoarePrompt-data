### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that it correctly computes the maximum profit Bob can achieve by selling his buns under the given promotional rules. Let's break down the logic used in the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a specific value of `k`.
   - The formula used is: \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).
     - \( k \times b \): Total revenue from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
     - \( \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \): Discount applied to the first `k` buns (since the price decreases by 1 coin for each subsequent bun).
     - \( (n - k) \times a \): Revenue from the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price.
   
2. **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**:
   - This function finds the maximum profit by iterating over possible values of `k` using a binary search approach.
   - The search range for `k` is between 0 and `min(n, b)`.
   - For each midpoint `mid` in the binary search, it calculates the profit for `mid` and `mid + 1` using `func_1`.
   - It updates `max_profit` with the higher of the two profits.
   - The binary search narrows down the range based on whether the profit increases or decreases as `k` increases.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Profit Calculation**: The formula in `func_1` correctly models the profit calculation as per the problem statement. It accounts for the decreasing prices of the first `k` buns and the constant price for the remaining buns.
- **Binary Search for Maximum Profit**: The binary search in `func_2` ensures that we efficiently find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit. Since the profit function is unimodal (it first increases and then decreases), binary search is an appropriate method to find the maximum.

### Conclusion:

Given that both functions correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement and the binary search in `func_2` effectively finds the maximum profit, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
