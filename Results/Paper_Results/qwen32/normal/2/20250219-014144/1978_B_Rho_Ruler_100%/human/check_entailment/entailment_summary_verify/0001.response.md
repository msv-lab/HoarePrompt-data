### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, code, and function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Bob sells buns with a promotion where the first `k` buns are sold at decreasing prices starting from `b` down to `b-k+1`, and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

#### Program Code Recap:
- **Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`**: Computes the profit for a given `k` using the formula:
  \[
  \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
  \]
- **Function `func_2(n, a, b)`**: Uses binary search to find the maximum profit by evaluating different values of `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)`.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- **Function `func_2`**: Takes `n`, `a`, and `b` as inputs and returns the maximum profit achievable.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search is correctly implemented to find the optimal `k` within the range `[0, min(n, b)]`.
   - The comparison between `profit_mid` and `profit_next` ensures that the search space is adjusted appropriately to find the maximum profit.

2. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The formula used in `func_1` is mathematically sound for calculating the profit for a given `k`.
   - The term `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` correctly computes the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
   - The term `(n - k) * a` correctly computes the profit from selling the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Case `k = 0`**: All buns are sold at the usual price `a`, which is handled correctly.
   - **Case `k = min(n, b)`**: The first `k` buns are sold at decreasing prices, and the remaining buns are sold at the usual price, which is also handled correctly.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently.
   - The profit calculation is accurate and covers all necessary scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It efficiently finds the optimal `k` using binary search and accurately calculates the profit for each `k`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: True**
