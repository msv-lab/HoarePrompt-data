### Reasoning:

The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game involving coins arranged in a circle. The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') at the start of the game.

Let's break down the logic:
- **Odd Number of 'U' Coins:** If the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an even number of 'U' coins after his turn. This pattern continues until Bob is left with a single 'U' coin, which he must remove, leaving Alice to win.
- **Even Number of 'U' Coins:** Conversely, if the number of 'U' coins is even, Bob can always respond to Alice's moves in such a way that he leaves Alice with an even number of 'U' coins after her turn. This pattern continues until Alice is left with a single 'U' coin, which she must remove, leaving Bob to win.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U' coins in the string `s` and checking if this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it returns 'YES', indicating Alice's victory; if even, it returns 'NO', indicating Bob's victory.

### Correctness:
The program's logic aligns perfectly with the game's rules and the optimal strategies for both players. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
