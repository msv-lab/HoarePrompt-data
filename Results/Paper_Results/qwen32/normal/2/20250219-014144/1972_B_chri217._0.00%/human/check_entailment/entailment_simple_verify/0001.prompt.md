You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if num_up % 2 == 1:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of 'U' and 'D' characters, representing the initial state of the coins where 'U' means the coin is facing up and 'D' means the coin is facing down. The length of s is a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if (num_up % 2 == 1) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES'
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves a circular arrangement of coins, each of which can be either facing up ("U") or down ("D"). Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The player who cannot make a move loses.

The key observation here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins ("U") determines the winner. This is because:

- If the number of "U" coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force a win by ensuring that after her turn, the number of "U" coins remains odd for the opponent.
- If the number of "U" coins is even, the second player (Bob) can always force a win by ensuring that after his turn, the number of "U" coins remains even for the opponent.

This strategy works because flipping adjacent coins does not change the parity of the total number of "U" coins. Thus, the parity of "U" coins at the start of the game determines the winner.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the input, processes each test case, and determines the winner based on the parity of the number of "U" coins.

Here's the breakdown of the code:
1. The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list `data`.
2. The first element of `data` is the number of test cases `t`.
3. For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coins.
4. It calls `func_1(s)` to determine the winner.
5. `func_1(s)` counts the number of "U" coins in the string `s` and returns "YES" if the count is odd, otherwise "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the number of "U" coins. Therefore, it will produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
