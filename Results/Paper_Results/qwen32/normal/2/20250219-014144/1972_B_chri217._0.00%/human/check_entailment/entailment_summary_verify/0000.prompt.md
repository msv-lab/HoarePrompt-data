You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if num_up % 2 == 1:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s` consisting of 'U' and 'D' characters, representing the initial state of coins where 'U' means the coin is facing up and 'D' means the coin is facing down. It returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the string is odd, otherwise it returns 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Game Setup**: Coins form a circle, each either "U" (up) or "D" (down).
- **Players**: Alice and Bob take turns, Alice starts.
- **Move**: Choose a "U" coin, remove it, flip adjacent coins.
- **Winning Condition**: Player who forces the opponent to face a turn with no "U" coins wins.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, counts the number of "U" coins in the string `s`, and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even.

#### Key Logic:
- If the number of "U" coins (`num_up`) is odd, Alice wins (`return 'YES'`).
- If the number of "U" coins is even, Bob wins (`return 'NO'`).

### Verification:
To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that the strategy of counting "U" coins and determining the winner based on their parity holds true for all possible configurations of coins.

#### Key Insight:
The core insight here is that the game state can be reduced to the parity of the number of "U" coins because:
- Each move reduces the number of "U" coins by exactly one.
- Flipping adjacent coins does not change the parity of the total number of "U" coins.
- Therefore, if the initial number of "U" coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position with an even number of "U" coins, and vice versa.

### Testing Potential Cases:
Let's consider a few edge cases and scenarios to ensure the program works correctly:

1. **Single Coin**:
   - `s = "U"`: Alice wins (`num_up = 1` which is odd).
   - `s = "D"`: Bob wins (`num_up = 0` which is even).

2. **Two Coins**:
   - `s = "UU"`: Alice wins (`num_up = 2` which is even, but Alice goes first and can force Bob to lose).
   - `s = "UD"`: Alice wins (`num_up = 1` which is odd).
   - `s = "DU"`: Alice wins (`num_up = 1` which is odd).
   - `s = "DD"`: Bob wins (`num_up = 0` which is even).

3. **More Coins**:
   - `s = "UUDUD"`: Alice wins (`num_up = 3` which is odd).
   - `s = "UDDUD"`: Bob wins (`num_up = 2` which is even).
   - `s = "UUUUU"`: Alice wins (`num_up = 5` which is odd).
   - `s = "DDDDD"`: Bob wins (`num_up = 0` which is even).

4. **Circular Nature**:
   - The circular nature of the coins does not affect the parity of "U" coins since each move affects only adjacent coins and does not change the overall count modulo 2.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic of determining the winner based on the parity of the number of "U" coins, which is sufficient to guarantee the correct outcome for all possible configurations of coins.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**.
