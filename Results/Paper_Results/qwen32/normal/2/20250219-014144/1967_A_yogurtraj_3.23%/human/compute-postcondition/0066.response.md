The `break` statement will terminate the current loop or iteration, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, `ii`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `ii` is the current value of `ii` plus 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
