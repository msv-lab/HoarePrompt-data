The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The other variables (`r`, `rem`, `y`, and `ii`) are not affected by this code.

Given the initial state where `ii` is incremented by 1, this increment operation is not part of the provided code snippet, so we will assume `ii` was incremented before the code snippet was executed.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `ii` retain their previous values.**
