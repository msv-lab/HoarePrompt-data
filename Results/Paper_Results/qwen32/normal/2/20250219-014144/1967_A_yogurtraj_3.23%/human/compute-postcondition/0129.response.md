To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration of the outer loop. Each iteration of the outer loop processes a separate test case, which involves reading `n`, `k`, and the list `a`, sorting `a`, and then processing it according to the inner loop logic.

Here's a breakdown of the process for each test case:

1. **Reading Input and Sorting**:
   - Read `n` and `k`.
   - Read the list `a` and sort it.

2. **Processing the List**:
   - Initialize `r` to the smallest element in `a`.
   - Initialize `rem` to 0 and `y` to 0.
   - Iterate through the sorted list `a` from the first element to the second-to-last element.
     - For each pair of consecutive elements `a[i]` and `a[i+1]`, check if the cost to make all elements up to `a[i+1]` equal is greater than `k`.
     - If it is, update `r` to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, set `rem` to `k % (i + 1)`, set `y` to the remaining elements count (`n - 1 - i`), and break out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, subtract the cost from `k` and update `r` to `a[i+1]`.
   - After the loop, if `k` is not zero, update `r` to `a[n-1] + k // n`.

3. **Calculating the Final Output**:
   - Print the result based on the final values of `r`, `rem`, and `y`.

Since each test case is processed independently, the final output state after all iterations will be the results of each test case printed sequentially.

Given the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the same logic applies to all iterations. Therefore, the final output state will be the concatenation of the results of each test case.

Output State: **the results of each test case printed sequentially.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the outer loop, the output will be a series of numbers, each representing the result of processing one test case according to the described logic. Each result is printed on a new line.
