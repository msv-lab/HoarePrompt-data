Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the sorted list `a`. The result is derived by determining how `k` can be distributed among the elements of `a` to achieve a certain condition, and then computing a final value that reflects this distribution.**
