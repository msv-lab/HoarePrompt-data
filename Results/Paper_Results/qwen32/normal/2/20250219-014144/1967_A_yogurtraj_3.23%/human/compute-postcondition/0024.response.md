The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before the operation, so the expression uses the incremented value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**
