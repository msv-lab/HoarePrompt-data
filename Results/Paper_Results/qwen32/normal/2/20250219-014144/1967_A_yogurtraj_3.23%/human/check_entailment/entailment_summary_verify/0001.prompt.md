You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

        r = a[0]

        for i in range(0, n - 1):
            if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
                r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
                rem = k % (i + 1)
                y = n - 1 - i
                k = 0
                break
            else:
                k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
                r = a[i + 1]
        if k != 0:
            r = a[n - 1] + k // n
            print((r - 1) * n + 1)
        else:
            print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the sorted list `a`. The result is derived by determining how `k` can be distributed among the elements of `a` to achieve a certain condition, and then computing a final value that reflects this distribution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding

The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that form permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. We can achieve this by purchasing up to `k` additional cards, each of which can be any integer between `1` and `n`.

### Key Points

1. **Initial Setup**: For each test case, we read `n` (number of distinct card types) and `k` (number of coins). Then, we read a list `a` where `a[i]` represents the number of cards with the value `i+1`.

2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This helps in determining how many cards need to be added to make all counts equal.

3. **Balancing Counts**:
   - We iterate through the sorted list `a` to see how many cards need to be added to make all counts equal.
   - For each index `i`, we calculate the difference `a[i+1] - a[i]` and multiply it by `(i+1)` to find out how many coins are needed to make all counts up to `a[i+1]`.
   - If the required coins exceed `k`, we calculate the maximum possible count `r` that can be achieved with the available coins and determine the remainder `rem` and the number of remaining indices `y`.
   - If we have enough coins to balance all counts, we update `r` to `a[n-1]` plus the remaining coins divided by `n`.

4. **Calculating the Score**:
   - The score is calculated based on the final count `r` and the remainder `rem`.
   - The formula `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` is used to compute the maximum score.

### Analysis of the Code

The code seems to follow the logic outlined above, but there are a few points to consider:

1. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - When `k` is very large, the code correctly calculates the final count `r` and handles the remainder `rem`.
   - When `k` is insufficient to balance all counts, the code calculates the maximum possible count `r` and adjusts accordingly.

2. **Correctness of the Formula**:
   - The formula `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` appears to be correct for calculating the maximum score. It accounts for the number of complete permutations and the additional subarrays formed by the remainder.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The sorting step takes `O(n log n)` time, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The subsequent iteration through the list takes `O(n)` time, making the overall complexity `O(n log n)` per test case, which is acceptable given the constraints.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It efficiently balances the counts of card types using the available coins and calculates the maximum score.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
