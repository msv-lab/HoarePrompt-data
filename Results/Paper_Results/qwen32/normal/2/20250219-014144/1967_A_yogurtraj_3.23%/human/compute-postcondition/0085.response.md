Postcondition: **`k`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` are defined as follows: If `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, and `rem` and `y` retain their values from the loop's completion or non-completion. If `k` is equal to 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1]` if the loop completes all iterations, or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` if the loop does not complete, and `rem` and `y` retain their values from the loop's completion or non-completion.**
