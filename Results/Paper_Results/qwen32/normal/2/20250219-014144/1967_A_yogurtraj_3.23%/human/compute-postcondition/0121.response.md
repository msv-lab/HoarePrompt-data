Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ii` retains its previous value, `i` is `i + 2`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is `k - ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))` and `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
