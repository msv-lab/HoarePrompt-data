The given code initializes a variable `soma_b` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, or `lista_B`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for these variables, except for the newly introduced `soma_b`.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `soma_b` is 0.**
