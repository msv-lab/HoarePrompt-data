The given code snippet updates the variable `pref` by adding the current value of `soma_b` to it. Since `soma_b` is initially 0, `pref` remains unchanged unless `soma_b` has been modified elsewhere in the code, which is not indicated here.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `pref` is now equal to `soma_b`. Since `soma_b` is 0, `pref` also becomes 0.

Output State: **`n` is at least `k + 1`, `k` is the second input integer, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `soma_b` is 0, `pref` is 0, and `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`.**
