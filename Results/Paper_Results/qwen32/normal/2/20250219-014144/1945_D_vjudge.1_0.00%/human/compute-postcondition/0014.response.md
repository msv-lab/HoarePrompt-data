Postcondition: **`n` is at least `k + 1`, `k` is the second input integer, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers obtained from the input, `lista_B` is a reversed list of integers obtained from the input. If `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`, then `pref` is updated to `pref + lista_A[i]` and `soma_b` remains 0. Otherwise, `soma_b` is updated to `soma_b + lista_B[i]` and `pref` is reset to 0.**
