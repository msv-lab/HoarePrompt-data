The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3. Since the loop iterates over `range(k + 1)`, the next value of `i` should be incremented by 1.

Here's the updated state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `i` is 4. If `i == 0`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[sums, sums]` where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the original value of `sums` and the updated value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[x + 2]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[2]`.**
