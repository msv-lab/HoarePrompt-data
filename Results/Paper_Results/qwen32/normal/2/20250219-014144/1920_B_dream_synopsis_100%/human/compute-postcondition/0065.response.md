The code snippet `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` adds the element at index `i - 1` of the list `a` to the variable `sums`. Given that `i` is 3, the element added to `sums` is `a[2]` (since list indices start at 0).

Therefore, the new value of `sums` is the old value of `sums` plus `a[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is 3, `sums` is the old value of `sums` plus `a[2]`.**
