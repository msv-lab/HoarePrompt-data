The code calculates `sums` by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a` from `sum1`. The list `a` is sorted in descending order, and `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `ans` remain unchanged except for the introduction of the new variable `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
