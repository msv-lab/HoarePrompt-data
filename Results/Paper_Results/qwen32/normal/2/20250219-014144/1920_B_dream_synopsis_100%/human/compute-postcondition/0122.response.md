Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum possible sum after performing a series of operations involving the first `k` elements and the subarray of length `x`.**
