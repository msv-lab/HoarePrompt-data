Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and possibly other previous sums, `i` is `i + 1`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `ans` now includes the newly appended value `sums`.**

Natural Language: The variable `ans` now includes the newly calculated value of `sums`, which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
