Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and possibly other previous sums, `i` is `i + 1`, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `sums` is updated by adding the element at index `i-1` of the reversed sorted list `a` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `sums` and `i`, which have been updated as described.
