The code snippet sorts the list `a`. This means that the order of elements in `a` is changed such that they are in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` values of sums computed as per the loop logic.**
