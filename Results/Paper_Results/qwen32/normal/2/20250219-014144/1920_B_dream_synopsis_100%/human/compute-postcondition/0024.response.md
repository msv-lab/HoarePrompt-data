The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed (now descending) list of `n` integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements, the first being `sums` and the second also being `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
