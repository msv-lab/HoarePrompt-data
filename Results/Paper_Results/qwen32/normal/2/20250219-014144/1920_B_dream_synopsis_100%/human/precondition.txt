t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple where the first element is a tuple (n, k, x) with integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n. The second element of the tuple is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
