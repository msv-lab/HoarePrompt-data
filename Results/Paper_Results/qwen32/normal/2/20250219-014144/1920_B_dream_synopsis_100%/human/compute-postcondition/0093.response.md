The given code snippet modifies the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n`, `k` must be at least 0
- `x` are integers read from the input
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is not equal to 0
- `i + x - 1` is less than `n`

After executing the code snippet:
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n`, `k` must be at least 0, `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not equal to 0, `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
