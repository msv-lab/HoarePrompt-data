To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which is just `i` in this case. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = k`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`.
- If `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- If `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated as follows: if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1]`.

Let's assume the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `i_current`. To find the state at the start of the next iteration, we simply increment `i` by 1.

### Step-by-step Reasoning:
1. **Identify the loop variable**: The loop variable is `i`.
2. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i_current + 1`.
3. **Adjust the state**: Only `i` needs to be adjusted. Other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, `sums`) remain unchanged.

### Example:
If at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is `i_current + 1`**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_current`, we express the next state in terms of `i_current + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is `i_current + 1`**

For a concrete example, if `i_current` was 2:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers with `k` being at least 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is 3**
