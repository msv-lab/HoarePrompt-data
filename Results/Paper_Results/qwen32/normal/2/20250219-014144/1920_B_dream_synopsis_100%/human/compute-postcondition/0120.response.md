Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - `number_of_test_cases`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` values of `sums` computed during each iteration, and `sums` holds the value computed in the last iteration (`i = k`). This process has been repeated for all `number_of_test_cases` provided initially.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will reflect how many test cases are left to process (which should be 0 if all test cases have been processed). The variables `n`, `k`, and `x` will hold the values from the last test case processed. The list `a` will contain the integers from the last test case, sorted in descending order. The variable `sum1` will store the sum of these integers. The list `ans` will contain the computed sums for the last test case, and `sums` will hold the final computed sum from the last iteration of the inner loop for the last test case.
