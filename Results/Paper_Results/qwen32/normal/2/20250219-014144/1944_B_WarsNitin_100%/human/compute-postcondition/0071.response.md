The value of `k` is decremented by 2. The values of `n`, `i`, and `ans2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans2` has two more elements which are `c[i-1]` and `c[i]`, and `k` is decreased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans2` has two more elements which are `c[i-1]` and `c[i]`, `k` is decreased by 2.**
