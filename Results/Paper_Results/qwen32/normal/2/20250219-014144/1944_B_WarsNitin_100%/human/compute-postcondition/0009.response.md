The given Python code snippet initializes an empty list named `ans2`. This action does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `ans1`). The only change is the introduction of `ans2` as an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list.**
