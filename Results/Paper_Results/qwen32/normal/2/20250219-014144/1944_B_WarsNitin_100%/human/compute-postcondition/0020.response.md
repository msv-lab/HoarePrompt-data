The code appends the last element of list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given that `b[n - 1]` is already the last element of `ans1`, appending `b[n - 1]` again results in `ans1` having two identical elements, both equal to `b[n - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` (now twice its original value) are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is a list containing the elements `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1]]`; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to `k`. Additionally, `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `l` is a list containing the single element `b[0]`. Otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.**
