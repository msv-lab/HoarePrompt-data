The code snippet assigns the value of `k` to the variable `req`. No other variables are modified by this code.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `req` now holds the value of `k`.

Output State: **`ans1` is an empty list; `ans2` is an empty list; `k` is twice the second integer from the input; `i` is `len(l) - 1`; `q` is incremented by 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `req` is twice the second integer from the input.**
