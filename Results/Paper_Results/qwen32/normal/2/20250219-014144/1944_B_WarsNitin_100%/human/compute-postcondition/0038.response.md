Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `k` is either 0, -2, or remains unchanged; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, which may or may not have consecutive duplicates; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is either an empty list, a list containing the elements `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1]]`, or a list containing the elements `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1], b[i], b[i]]` or `[b[i], b[i]]` depending on its initial state and the value of `b[i]`; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to `k`. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `l` is a list containing the elements `b[0]` and possibly `b[n - 1]`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the single element `b[n - 1]` if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, or it remains an empty list if `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`. Additionally, if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, then `k` is set to -2 and `ans1` may include additional elements `[b[i], b[i]]`. If `b[i] != b[i - 1]`, then `b` has no consecutive duplicates up to `b[i]` and `l` includes the element `b[i]`. `i` is incremented by 1. If `k` was initially 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
