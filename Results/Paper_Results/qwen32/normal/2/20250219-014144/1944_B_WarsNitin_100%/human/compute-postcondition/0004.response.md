The code snippet creates a new list `b` which is a slice of the list `a` from the start up to (but not including) the index `n`. This means `b` will contain the first `n` elements of `a`.

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the operation. The variables `n` and `k` also remain unchanged since they are only used to determine the slice of `a` and not modified themselves. The list `a` remains unchanged as well, but a new list `b` is created.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `a`.**
