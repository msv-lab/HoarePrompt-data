Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `ans1` and `ans2` each contain all elements of `l`. This means `ans1` and `ans2` are copies of the list `l`.
- `k` is adjusted to be `k - len(l)`. However, the value of `k` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `i` is set to `len(l) - 1`. Similar to `k`, `i` is not used in the print statement and thus does not affect the output.

### Print Statement Analysis:
- The print statement is `print(*ans2)`. The asterisk (`*`) operator unpacks the elements of the list `ans2` and prints them separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
Since `ans2` is a copy of the list `l`, printing `*ans2` will result in printing all the elements of `l` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Given that `ans2` is identical to `l`, the output will be the elements of `l` printed in sequence.

Output: **the elements of list l separated by spaces**
