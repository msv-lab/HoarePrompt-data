The code snippet `k -= 2` decreases the value of `k` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `k` was already specified to be twice its original value. After executing `k -= 2`, `k` is now equal to its previous value minus 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` (now `k - 2`) are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`; `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` from index `n` to the end; `ans1` is a list containing the elements `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1]]`; `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to `k`; Additionally, `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `l` is a list containing the single element `b[0]`. Otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.**
