Output State: **`a` is 'TRIANGLE', `n` is greater than 0, `i` remains unchanged, `t` is greater than the value of `i`, `s` is the new user's input, `b` is 'SQUARE' if the new `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string, `j` is `j + 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `a` has been changed to 'TRIANGLE'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
