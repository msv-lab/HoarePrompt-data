Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
We need to identify whether a given binary grid of size \( n \times n \) contains either a square or a triangle made up of '1's. 

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = 0
        b = ''
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
```

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Initialization of `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` is initialized to `0`, but it is later assigned a string value ('TRIANGLE'). This can lead to confusion since `a != 0` will always be true when `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'.
   
2. **Logic for Determining Shape:**
   - The program checks if any row has exactly one '1'. If so, it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the entire shape is a triangle.
   - Similarly, if any row has more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'. This is also insufficient to determine if the entire shape is a square.
   - The program does not check the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square across multiple rows.

3. **Final Decision Making:**
   - The program prints 'TRIANGLE' if `a` is not `0` (which will always be the case once `a` is set), otherwise it prints 'SQUARE'.
   - This logic does not accurately reflect the conditions for identifying a triangle or a square as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square based on the specified patterns. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
