### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code to see if it correctly determines whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle based on the given problem description.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `a` is initialized to `0`.
   - The variable `b` is initialized to an empty string `''`.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the size of the grid `n` is read.
   - The grid itself is read line by line.

3. **Processing Each Line**:
   - For each line `s` in the grid:
     - If the count of '1's in the line `s` is exactly 1, `a` is set to `'TRIANGLE'`.
     - If the count of '1's in the line `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to `'SQUARE'`.

4. **Determining the Shape**:
   - After processing all lines in a test case:
     - If `a` is not `0` (meaning there was at least one row with exactly one '1'), it prints `'TRIANGLE'`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `'SQUARE'`.

### Issues in the Code:

- **Incorrect Logic**: 
  - The code does not correctly identify the shapes based on the problem's definition. 
  - The problem specifies that a triangle must have rows with an odd number of '1's increasing from 1 to `2*k-1` and centered, while a square must have rows with exactly `k` '1's aligned.
  - The current code only checks the number of '1's in each row without considering their positions or the overall pattern.

- **Insufficient Checks**:
  - The code does not verify the pattern of '1's across multiple rows to ensure they form a valid triangle or square.
  - It only sets `a` or `b` based on the count of '1's in individual rows, which is insufficient to determine the shape.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle based on the problem's specifications.

**Correctness: False**
