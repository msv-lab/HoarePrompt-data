Given the initial state:
- `a` is 0.
- `b` is either an empty string (`''`) or `'SQUARE'`.
- `j` is equal to `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(b)
```

From the initial state, we know that the variable `b` can take one of two values: an empty string (`''`) or the string `'SQUARE'`. Since no further information is provided to determine which specific value `b` holds, both possibilities must be considered.

Therefore, the output of the `print(b)` statement will be either an empty string or the string `'SQUARE'`.

Output: **b (where b is either '' or 'SQUARE')**
