You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the grid is an n × n list of lists where each element is either '0' or '1'; the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square made up of '1's, and the size of the shape (k) is greater than 1.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0
        
        b = ''
        
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
        
    #State: The variable `i` will be equal to `t`, `a` will be `'TRIANGLE'` if any row in any test case had exactly one '1', otherwise `a` will be 0, `b` will be `'SQUARE'` if any row in any test case had more than one '1', otherwise `b` will be an empty string, `n` will be the last input integer read before the loop ends, and `j` will be equal to `n`. Each test case will print either `'TRIANGLE'` or `'SQUARE'` based on the conditions specified.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and an n × n grid of lists containing only '0's and '1's. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square made up of '1's, with the size of the shape (k) being greater than 1. For each test case, the function returns the area of the shape (triangle or square) formed by the '1's in the grid.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
