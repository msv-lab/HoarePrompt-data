Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences of a given string `s`. If not, we must provide a counterexample string.

### Provided Code Analysis

#### Main Logic
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Function Call**: For each test case, it calls `func_1(s, k, n)` which is supposed to determine if all possible subsequences of length `n` exist in `s`.
3. **Output Handling**: Based on the result from `func_1`, it prints either "YES" or "NO" followed by a counterexample string if necessary.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Purpose**: To check if all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets exist in `s`.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Initializes an alphabet set containing the first `k` lowercase letters.
  - Iterates through `s` and removes characters from the alphabet set when encountered.
  - Resets the alphabet set and constructs `s1` and `s2` based on certain conditions.
  - Returns a tuple `(bool, str, str)` where the boolean indicates if the length of the processed string is at least `n * k`.

### Issues in `func_1`
1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Subsequences**:
   - The function does not actually check if all possible subsequences of length `n` exist in `s`. Instead, it focuses on removing characters from an alphabet set and constructing `s1` and `s2` in a way that doesn't align with the problem requirements.
   
2. **Counterexample Construction**:
   - The logic for constructing a counterexample string is flawed. It attempts to repeat a character that is not in `s1`, but this does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid counterexample.

### Example Analysis
Consider the test case:
```
1
3 2 6
aababb
```
- **Expected Output**: `NO` followed by a counterexample string like `aaa`.
- **Actual Behavior of `func_1`**:
  - The function will process `s` and possibly return a boolean indicating failure, but the constructed counterexample string will not necessarily be correct.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to check for all possible subsequences of length `n` and does not construct a valid counterexample string when necessary.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect as it does not meet the problem requirements for checking subsequences and constructing valid counterexamples.
