s is a string of length m consisting only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The function `func_1` is defined with parameters that do not directly match the problem description; it should take four parameters: t (number of test cases), n (length of the strings to check), k (number of different lowercase English alphabets used), and s (the string to check against). However, based on the given function definition `def func_1(s, k, n):`, we assume s is the string for a single test case, and n and k are as described.
