Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length `m` (where `m` is at least 1) consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in `s`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` includes the character `i` appended to its previous value, and `s2` is determined based on the new `i` and `alphabet`. If `len(alphabet) != 1`, `alphabet` is updated to exclude `i`; otherwise, `alphabet` is reset to the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, no changes are made to `s1`, `s2`, or `alphabet`.**
