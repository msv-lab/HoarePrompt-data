To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations. We will also verify the mathematical formulation used in the code.

### Problem Analysis:

The objective is to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. This expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers. The final output is \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Mathematical Formulation:

1. **Number of Possible Pairs**:
   - The number of ways to choose any pair from `n` children is \(C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

2. **Expected Contribution of a Friend Pair**:
   - For a friend pair with initial friendship value \(f\), the expected contribution to the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions can be derived using linearity of expectation.
   - The expected value for a single friend pair is:
     \[
     E = f \cdot \left(1 + \frac{k-1}{C(n,2)} + \frac{(k-1)(k-2)}{C(n,2)^2} + \ldots \right)
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     E = f \cdot \left(1 + \frac{k-1}{C(n,2)-1}\right)
     \]
   - Summing over all friend pairs and simplifying leads to the formula used in the code.

### Code Analysis:

The provided code calculates the expected value using the following steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - Define the modulo constant `M = 10^9 + 7`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - Read `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Initialize `sum_f` to accumulate the sum of initial friendship values.
   - For each friend pair, add their friendship value to `sum_f`.
   - Calculate `cn2` as the number of ways to choose any pair from `n` children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - Compute `p` and `q` using the formula derived above.
   - Simplify the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).
   - Compute the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M` using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - Print the result of \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M\).

### Verification:

The formula used in the code is:
\[
p = 2 \cdot k \cdot C(n,2) \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
\]
\[
q = 2 \cdot C(n,2)^2
\]

Let's verify if this formula aligns with the expected value calculation:

1. **Contribution of Each Friend Pair**:
   - For a friend pair with initial friendship value \(f\), the expected contribution is:
     \[
     E = f \cdot \left(1 + \frac{k-1}{C(n,2)-1}\right)
     \]
   - Summing over all friend pairs:
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \cdot \left(1 + \frac{k-1}{C(n,2)-1}\right)
     \]
     \[
     = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i\right) + \left(\sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i\right) \cdot \frac{k-1}{C(n,2)-1}
     \]
     \[
     = \text{sum\_f} + \text{sum\_f} \cdot \frac{k-1}{C(n,2)-1}
     \]
     \[
     = \text{sum\_f} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{k-1}{C(n,2)-1}\right)
     \]

2. **Simplifying the Formula**:
   - Let \(C(n,2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - The expected value can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = \text{sum\_f} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{k-1}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-1}\right)
     \]
     \[
     = \text{sum\_f} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{2(k-1)}{n(n-1)-2}\right)
     \]
     \[
     = \text{sum\_f} \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1)-2 + 2(k-1)}{n(n-1)-2}\right)
     \]
     \[
     = \text{sum\_f} \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1) + 2k - 4}{n(n-1)-2}\right)
     \]

3. **Matching with the Code Formula**:
   - The code formula:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot C(n,2) \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot C(n,2)^2
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     = k \cdot n(n-1) \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2
     \]
     \[
     = 2 \cdot \frac{n^2(n-1)^2}{4}
     \]
     \[
     = \frac{n^2(n-1)^2}{2}
     \]

The formula used in the code does not directly match the derived expected value formula. There seems to be a discrepancy in the formulation.

### Conclusion:

Given the discrepancy between the derived expected value formula and the formula used in the code, the original assessment might be inaccurate. The code does not correctly implement the expected value calculation based on the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **False**
