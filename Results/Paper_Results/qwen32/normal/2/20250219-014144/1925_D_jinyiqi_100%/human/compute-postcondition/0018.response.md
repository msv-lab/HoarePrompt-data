The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q` using the `math.gcd` function and assigns the result to the variable `gcd`. The values of `sum_f`, `j`, `cn2`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum_f` is the cumulative sum of all f values read over m iterations, `j` is equal to m, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
