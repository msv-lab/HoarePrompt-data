You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the m lines contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, where a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. All pairs (a_i, b_i) are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        sum_f = 0
        
        for j in range(m):
            a, b, f = map(int, input().split())
            sum_f += f
        
        cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
        
        q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
        
        gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
        
        p = p // gcd
        
        q = q // gcd
        
        print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
        
    #State: A sequence of `t` integers, each representing the result of one test case modulo `M`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n` (the number of elements), `m` (the number of connections), and `k` (an additional integer). It also receives `m` lines of three integers each (`a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`), representing connections between elements and associated values. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
