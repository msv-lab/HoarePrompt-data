To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and accumulates results. Given the structure of the loop, each iteration processes a separate test case with its own set of `n`, `m`, `k`, and edge weights `f_i`. The calculations within each iteration are independent of the others, except that they all share the same modulus `M`.

Let's break down the final state after all `t` iterations:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Input Reading**: For each iteration, the code reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
3. **Edge Weights Sum**: It then reads `m` edges, each with a weight `f_i`, and calculates the sum of these weights, `sum_f`.
4. **Combinatorial Calculation**: It computes `cn2` as the number of ways to choose 2 nodes out of `n`, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
5. **Numerator and Denominator Calculation**: It calculates `p` as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` and `q` as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.
6. **GCD Calculation**: It finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q`.
7. **Simplification**: It simplifies `p` and `q` by dividing both by their GCD.
8. **Modular Inverse and Final Calculation**: It calculates the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M` and multiplies it by `p`, taking the result modulo `M`.

Since each iteration processes a separate test case independently, the final output state after all iterations will be the sequence of results printed for each test case. Each result is a single integer representing the simplified fraction `p/q` modulo `M`.

### Final Output State Description:
After all `t` iterations, the program will have printed `t` integers, each corresponding to the result of one test case. The state of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd` will reflect the last test case processed, but the primary output is the sequence of integers printed for each test case.

### Output State:
Output State: **A sequence of `t` integers, each representing the result of one test case modulo `M`.**

In natural language, this means that after processing all the test cases, the program will output a series of numbers, each corresponding to the result of a single test case, formatted as specified in the code.
