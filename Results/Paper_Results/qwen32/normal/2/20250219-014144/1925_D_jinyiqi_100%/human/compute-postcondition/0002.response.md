The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The current state indicates that `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\). Since this condition already ensures that `t` is at least 1, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

Before the loop starts, the state of `i` is not explicitly mentioned, but since `i` is the loop variable, it will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts. Therefore, we don't need to specify an initial value for `i` in the state as it will be automatically set by the loop.

Thus, the state remains as given, with the understanding that `i` will be initialized correctly by the loop itself.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 · 10^4**
