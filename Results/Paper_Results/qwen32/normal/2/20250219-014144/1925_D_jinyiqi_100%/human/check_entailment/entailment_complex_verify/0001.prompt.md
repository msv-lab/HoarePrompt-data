You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Objective**: 
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - This expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers.
   - Finally, we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

2. **Understanding the Expected Value**:
   - For each excursion, a pair of children is chosen uniformly at random.
   - If the chosen pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected value calculation involves considering the probability of choosing a friend pair and the contribution of their friendship values.

3. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - Let \(C(n, 2)\) denote the number of ways to choose any pair from `n` children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - For each friend pair, the expected contribution to the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions can be derived using linearity of expectation.
   - The expected value for a single friend pair with initial friendship value \(f\) is:
     \[
     E = f \cdot \left(1 + \frac{k-1}{C(n,2)} + \frac{(k-1)(k-2)}{C(n,2)^2} + \ldots \right)
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     E = f \cdot \left(1 + \frac{k-1}{C(n,2)} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{C(n,2)}}\right) = f \cdot \left(1 + \frac{k-1}{C(n,2)-1}\right)
     \]
   - Summing over all friend pairs and simplifying leads to the formula used in the code.

### Code Analysis:

The provided code calculates the expected value using the following steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - Define the modulo constant `M = 10^9 + 7`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - Read `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - Initialize `sum_f` to accumulate the sum of initial friendship values.
   - For each friend pair, add their friendship value to `sum_f`.
   - Calculate `cn2` as the number of ways to choose any pair from `n` children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - Compute `p` and `q` using the formula derived above.
   - Simplify the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).
   - Compute the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M` using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - Print the result of \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M\).

### Verification:

The formula used in the code seems to be derived correctly based on the expected value calculation. However, there are a few points to verify:

1. **Formula Accuracy**:
   - The formula used in the code is:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot C(n,2) \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot C(n,2)^2
     \]
   - This formula appears to be a simplified version of the expected value calculation, but it needs to be verified against the detailed mathematical derivation.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles cases where there are no friend pairs (`m = 0`) correctly by setting `sum_f` to 0.
   - It also handles large values of `n` and `k` efficiently using modular arithmetic.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the problem and the provided code, the formula used in the code seems to be correct based on the expected value calculation. The code handles various edge cases and uses efficient modular arithmetic to compute the result.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
