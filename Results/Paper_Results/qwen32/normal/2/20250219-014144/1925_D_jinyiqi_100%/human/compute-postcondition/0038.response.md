Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `j` is equal to `m`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`, `cn2`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged from the initial state. The new variable `gcd` is introduced, which holds the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
