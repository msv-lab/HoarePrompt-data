The given code snippet recalculates the value of `cn2`. Since `cn2` is already defined in the initial state as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, executing the same calculation again does not change its value.

Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the fact that the calculation for `cn2` is performed again, which doesn't alter its value.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `j` is equal to `m`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is calculated as `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `i` is `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`.**
