The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. Since the exact values of these integers are not specified in the initial state, they will be determined by the input provided during execution.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `f` are integers read from the input.**
This means that after executing the code, `a`, `b`, and `f` will hold the values provided by the user input, split into three separate integers.
