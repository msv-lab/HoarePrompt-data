Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Here are some issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**: The program incorrectly calculates the probability of selecting a friend pair and the contribution of each pair to the expected value.
   
2. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used in the program `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` and `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2` is not correct for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

3. **Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**: The program does not correctly account for the fact that non-friend pairs have a friendship value of 0 and do not increase over time.

Here is a corrected approach to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate Total Possible Pairs**: Compute the total number of possible pairs of children, which is `C(n, 2) = n*(n-1)/2`.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - For each friend pair `(a, b)` with initial friendship value `f`, the expected value contribution of this pair over `k` excursions is `f * (k + 1) / 2` because the friendship value increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen.
   - Sum up these contributions for all friend pairs.
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair in one excursion is `1 / C(n, 2)`.
   - Therefore, the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs is the sum of contributions of all friend pairs divided by `C(n, 2)`.

3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result needs to be modulo `10^9 + 7`, ensure all calculations respect this constraint.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        sum_f = 0
        for j in range(m):
            (a, b, f) = map(int, input().split())
            sum_f += f
        cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
        # Expected value contribution of all friend pairs
        expected_value = sum_f * (k + 1) // 2
        # Probability of choosing any specific pair in one excursion
        p = expected_value
        q = cn2
        gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
        p = p // gcd
        q = q // gcd
        print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))

func()
```

This corrected program should produce the correct output for the given problem.
