### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand if the solution is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `friendships`: A list of `m` tuples, where each tuple `(a, b, f)` represents a pair of friends with an initial friendship value `f`.

2. **Objective**:
   - Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - This expected value should be expressed as a fraction `p/q` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.
   - Compute `p * q^-1 mod (10^9 + 7)`.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Each pair of friends `(a, b)` with an initial friendship value `f` will contribute to the sum in each excursion.
   - The contribution of a pair `(a, b)` in the `i-th` excursion is `f + i - 1` if the pair is chosen.
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair `(a, b)` in one excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
   - Since the choices are independent, the expected contribution of a pair `(a, b)` over `k` excursions is the sum of the probabilities of choosing the pair in each excursion multiplied by its contribution in that excursion.

4. **Formula Derivation**:
   - The expected contribution of a pair `(a, b)` with initial friendship value `f` is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left(\frac{f + i - 1}{\binom{n}{2}}\right)
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \sum_{i=1}^{k} (f + i - 1) = \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \left(kf + \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} - k\right) = \frac{kf + \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} - k}{\binom{n}{2}}
     \]
   - However, since the denominator `\binom{n}{2}` cancels out when considering the total expected sum across all pairs, we can simplify our calculation to:
     \[
     kf + \frac{k(k + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - The term `\frac{k(k + 1)}{2}` is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is used in the code.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - It iterates over each friendship and calculates the contribution using the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`.
  - It accumulates these contributions and returns the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.
  - **Issue**: The formula used in the code is incorrect. The correct formula should account for the probability of selecting each pair, which is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`. The current implementation does not include this probability factor, leading to an incorrect result.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - It reads the input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the result.
  - This part is correct assuming `func_1` is correct.

### Conclusion:
The implementation of `func_1` is incorrect due to the missing probability factor. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
