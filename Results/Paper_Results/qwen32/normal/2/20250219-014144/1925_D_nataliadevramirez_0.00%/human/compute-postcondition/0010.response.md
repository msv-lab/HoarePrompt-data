To determine the output of the `print(result)` statement, we need to understand the context and the function `func_1` that computes the `result`. However, the function `func_1` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot compute the exact value of `result`.

Given the information:

- `n` is an integer read from input.
- `m` is an integer read from input.
- `k` is an integer read from input.
- `t` is at least 1 and is decremented by 1 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

Since the function `func_1` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. Therefore, we can only describe it in terms of the function's inputs and its purpose.

Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships))**
