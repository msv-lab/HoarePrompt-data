### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
The task is to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, considering that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time that pair is chosen. The final result should be expressed as \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers, and we need to output \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \).

#### Key Points Recap:
1. **Friendship Value Increase**: Each time a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.
2. **Expected Value Calculation**: We need to calculate the expected sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The result should be given modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Code Analysis Recap:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function calculates the result for a single test case.
2. `func_2`: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Input Parameters**: `n` (number of children), `m` (number of pairs of friends), `k` (number of excursions), and `friendships` (list of friendship details).
- **Logic**:
  - The code iterates over each friendship.
  - For each friendship, it calculates the contribution to the result using the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
  - The term `k * (k + 1) // 2` represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the expected sum of friendship values for a pair if it is chosen `k` times.
  - The result is accumulated and returned modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Reading**: Reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- **Processing**: Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

#### Correctness Check:
- **Formula Used**: The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` is correct for calculating the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which represents the expected sum of friendship values for a pair if it is chosen `k` times.
- **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) as required.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The code correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input and processing each test case independently.

However, there is a critical issue with the formula used in the code. The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` assumes that each pair is chosen exactly once, but the problem specifies that each pair is chosen equiprobably and independently. This means that the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \), where \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the total number of possible pairs of children.

The correct expected value for the sum of friendship values for a pair is:
\[ E[f] = f \times \left(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \left(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + \text{(number of times chosen)}\right)\right) \]

Given that each pair is chosen independently and equiprobably, the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \). The expected sum of friendship values for a pair chosen \( x \) times is \( f \times \left(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \left(\frac{x(x + 1)}{2}\right)\right) \).

However, the current implementation incorrectly uses `k * (k + 1) // 2` without considering the probability of choosing each pair.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly account for the probability of choosing each pair, leading to an incorrect calculation of the expected value. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
