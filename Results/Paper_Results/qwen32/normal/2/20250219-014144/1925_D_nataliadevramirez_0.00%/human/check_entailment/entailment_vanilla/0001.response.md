Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, considering that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time that pair is chosen. The final result should be expressed as \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers, and we need to output \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \).

### Key Points:
1. **Friendship Value Increase**: For each pair of friends, their friendship value increases by 1 every time they are chosen.
2. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs needs to be calculated.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The result should be given modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function calculates the result for a single test case.
2. `func_2`: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Input Parameters**: `n` (number of children), `m` (number of pairs of friends), `k` (number of excursions), and `friendships` (list of friendship details).
- **Logic**:
  - The code iterates over each friendship.
  - For each friendship, it calculates the contribution to the result using the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
  - The term `k * (k + 1) // 2` represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the expected sum of friendship values for a pair if it is chosen `k` times.
  - The result is accumulated and returned modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Reading**: Reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- **Processing**: Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

### Correctness Check:
- **Formula Used**: The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` is correct for calculating the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which represents the expected sum of friendship values for a pair if it is chosen `k` times.
- **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) as required.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The code correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input and processing each test case independently.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as per the given requirements and constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
