Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions. The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen as a friend during an excursion. We need to compute this expected value modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Key Points:
1. **Friendship Value Increase**: For each friend pair, the friendship value increases linearly with the number of times they are chosen.
2. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value for a friend pair is the sum of the arithmetic series from 1 to k (i.e., \(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k\)), which is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\).
3. **Multiple Friend Pairs**: Each friend pair contributes independently to the total expected value.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution consists of two functions:
- `func_1`: Computes the expected value for a single test case.
- `func_2`: Handles multiple test cases by reading input and calling `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Parameters**: `n` (number of children), `m` (number of friend pairs), `k` (number of excursions), `friendships` (list of friend pairs with initial friendship values).
- **Logic**: 
  - It initializes `result` to 0.
  - For each friend pair, it adds the product of the initial friendship value and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (\(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\)) to `result`.
  - It returns `result` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Logic**:
  - Reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of friend pairs.
  - Calls `func_1` to compute the result for the current test case and prints it.

### Correctness Check:
- **Arithmetic Series Sum**: The formula used for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is correct: \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\).
- **Independence of Friend Pairs**: The solution correctly treats each friend pair independently, adding their contributions to the total expected value.
- **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as required.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input and processing each test case separately.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs across multiple test cases.

**Correctness: True**
