The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `friendships`, and `result`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `t` must be at least 2 and is decremented by 1, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**. 

In simpler terms, `n`, `m`, and `k` now hold the values read from the input, while the rest of the variables retain their initial states.
