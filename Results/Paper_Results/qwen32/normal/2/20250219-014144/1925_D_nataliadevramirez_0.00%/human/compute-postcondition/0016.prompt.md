Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the number of children such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `m` is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), `k` is an integer representing the number of excursions such that 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, and `friendships` is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `t` must be at least 1, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `t` must be at least 1 and is decremented by 1, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `t` must be at least 2 and is decremented by 1, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` and has been returned.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
