Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided code and the problem description to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions.
- Each time a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.
- The final result should be expressed as \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers, and we need to output \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \).

### Key Points:
1. **Friendship Value Increase**: For each pair of friends, their friendship value increases by 1 every time they are chosen.
2. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs needs to be calculated.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The result should be given modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function calculates the result for a single test case.
2. `func_2`: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Input Parameters**: `n` (number of children), `m` (number of pairs of friends), `k` (number of excursions), and `friendships` (list of friendship details).
- **Logic**:
  - The code iterates over each friendship.
  - For each friendship, it calculates the contribution to the result using the formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`.
  - The term `k * (k + 1) // 2` represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the expected sum of friendship values for a pair if it is chosen `k` times.
  - The result is accumulated and returned modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Reading**: Reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- **Processing**: Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

### Correctness Check:
- **Formula Used**: The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` is correct for calculating the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which represents the expected sum of friendship values for a pair if it is chosen `k` times.
- **Modulo Operation**: The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) as required.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The code correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input and processing each test case independently.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Fraction Representation**: The problem requires the result to be expressed as \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers, and we need to output \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \). The current implementation directly sums up the expected values without considering the denominator \( q \).
2. **Denominator Calculation**: The denominator \( q \) is the total number of ways to choose any pair of children, which is \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). Since each pair is chosen equiprobably, the expected value for each pair should be divided by this denominator.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly implement the solution, we need to account for the denominator \( q \):

1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose any pair of children: \( q = \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
2. For each pair of friends, calculate the expected increase in their friendship value: \( \text{expected\_increase} = f \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).
3. Sum up the expected increases for all pairs of friends.
4. Divide the total expected increase by the total number of ways to choose any pair of children to get the expected value.
5. Convert the expected value to the form \( \frac{p}{q} \) and compute \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) \).

Given the above points, the original implementation is incorrect because it does not account for the denominator \( q \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is inaccurate because the code does not correctly handle the denominator \( q \) required for the expected value calculation.
