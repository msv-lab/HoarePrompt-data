The given code snippet reads `m` lines of input, each containing three integers, and stores these integers in a list of lists called `friendships`. This means that the `friendships` list will now contain `m` sublists, each representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `friendships`, as it gets populated with the input data. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `t` must be at least 1, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.**
