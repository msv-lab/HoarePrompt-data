The value of `x` is updated to be the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, divided by 2 (integer division). The other variables (`t`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`, `l`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are the newly read integers from the input; `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`; `l`, `r` are as calculated in the previous iteration; `i` is `i + 1`.**
