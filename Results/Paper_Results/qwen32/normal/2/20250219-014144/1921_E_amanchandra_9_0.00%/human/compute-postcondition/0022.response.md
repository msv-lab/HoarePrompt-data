Let's break down the given Python code snippet and determine what will be printed based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input.
- `x` is calculated as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
- `l` is calculated as `max(1, yb - x)`.
- `r` is calculated as `min(w, yb + x)`.
- `i` is unchanged (though it's not used in the print statement).

### Code Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
```

This line uses tuple indexing to select between two lists based on a condition. Let's break it down:

1. **Condition**: `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`
   - `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`.
   - `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`.
   - `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`.

2. **Tuple Indexing**:
   - If the condition is `True`, the expression evaluates to `['Alice']`.
   - If the condition is `False`, the expression evaluates to `['Draw']`.

3. **Unpacking with `*` Operator**:
   - The `*` operator unpacks the selected list into separate arguments for the `print` function.

### Determining the Output:
To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`:

- `l = max(1, yb - x)`
- `r = min(w, yb + x)`
- `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`

The condition checks if `ya` is within a vertical range `[l, r]` plus/minus `x + 1`. Specifically:
- `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` checks if `ya` is within `x + 1` units above or below `l`.
- `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` checks if `ya` is within `x + 1` units above or below `r`.

If both conditions are satisfied, `ya` is within the specified vertical range, and the code prints `['Alice']` unpacked, resulting in `Alice`. Otherwise, it prints `['Draw']` unpacked, resulting in `Draw`.

### Final Output:
Given the condition and the unpacking, the output will be either `Alice` or `Draw` depending on whether `ya` is within the specified vertical range.

Output: **Alice (if abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1) otherwise Draw**
