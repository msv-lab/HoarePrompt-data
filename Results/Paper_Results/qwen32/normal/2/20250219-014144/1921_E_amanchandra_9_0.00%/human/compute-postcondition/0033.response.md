Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are the newly read integers from the input; `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`; `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`; `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simple terms, the variable `r` has been updated to be the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. All other variables retain their previously described values.
