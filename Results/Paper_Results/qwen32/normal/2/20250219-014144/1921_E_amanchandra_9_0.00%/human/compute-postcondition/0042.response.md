Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the dimensions of a grid (`h` and `w`) and the coordinates of two distinct points (`(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`). For each test case, it determines and prints the result of a game between Alice and Bob based on their positions relative to each other and the grid boundaries. The possible results are "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw".**
