The value of `l` is determined by taking the maximum of 1 and the result of `ya - x`. Given that `x` is `(xb - xa) // 2` and the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even, `x` will be an integer.

The value of `l` will be:
- `ya - x` if `ya - x` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `1` if `ya - x` is less than 1.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input; `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`; `x` is `(xb - xa) // 2`; the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even; `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`**.
