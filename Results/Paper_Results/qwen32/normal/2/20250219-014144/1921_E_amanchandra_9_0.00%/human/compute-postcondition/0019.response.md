The code snippet assigns the value of `abs(xa - xb) // 2` to the variable `x`. This means `x` is now equal to half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input; `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`; `l`, `r`, and `i` are unchanged.**
