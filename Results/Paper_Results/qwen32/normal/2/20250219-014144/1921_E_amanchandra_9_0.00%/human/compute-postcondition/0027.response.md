Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input; `x`, `l`, `r`, and `i` are unchanged if `xa` is not greater than `xb`. If `xa` is greater than `xb`, then `x` is set to `abs(xa - xb) // 2`; `l` is `max(1, yb - x)` if `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true, otherwise `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`; `r` is `min(w, yb + x)` in both cases; `i` remains unchanged.**
