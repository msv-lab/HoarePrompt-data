The code updates the value of `r` to be the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input
- `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`
- `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`
- `r` and `i` are unchanged

After executing `r = min(w, yb + x)`, the new value of `r` is determined.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input; `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`; `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`; `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`; `i` is unchanged.**
