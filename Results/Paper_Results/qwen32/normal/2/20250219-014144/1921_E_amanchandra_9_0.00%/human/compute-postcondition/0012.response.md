Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers read from the input; `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`; `x` is `(xb - xa) // 2`; the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even; `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`; `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`**.

In natural language, the output state remains the same as the initial state except that the variable `r` is now assigned the value of `min(w, yb + x)`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
