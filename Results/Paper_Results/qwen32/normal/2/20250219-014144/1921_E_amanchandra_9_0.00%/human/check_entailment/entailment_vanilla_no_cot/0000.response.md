To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic step-by-step against the problem requirements.

The program aims to determine the winner of the game between Alice and Bob based on their initial positions and the rules of movement. Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Initial Conditions Check**: It checks if Alice's initial row (`xa`) is greater than Bob's initial row (`xb`). If `xa > xb`, it prints "Draw". This is because Alice cannot win if she starts below Bob since she can only move downwards, diagonally down-left, or diagonally down-right.
3. **Distance Calculation**: If `xa` is not greater than `xb`, it calculates the half distance between Alice's and Bob's rows (`x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`). This value represents the maximum number of moves Alice can make towards Bob's row before Bob can reach her.
4. **Odd Distance Case**: If the distance between their rows is odd (`if abs(xa - xb) % 2`), it calculates the leftmost (`l`) and rightmost (`r`) columns within the board boundaries where Bob could be after `x` moves. It then checks if Alice can be within this range (`abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`). If so, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
5. **Even Distance Case**: If the distance between their rows is even, it calculates the leftmost (`l`) and rightmost (`r`) columns within the board boundaries where Bob could be after `x` moves. It then checks if Bob can be within this range (`abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x`). If so, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

However, there are several issues with this logic:
- The condition for printing "Draw" when `xa > xb` is incorrect. Alice can still win if she can force Bob into a position where he cannot move without colliding with Alice.
- The calculations for `l` and `r` are incorrect in both the odd and even distance cases. They should consider the actual movement possibilities of both players.
- The logic for determining the winner based on the calculated ranges is flawed. It does not correctly account for the optimal moves that both players can make.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the winner for all possible scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
