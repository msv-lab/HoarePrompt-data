To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic against the problem requirements.

### Game Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who start at different positions on a checkered board. They take turns moving their chips according to specific rules:

- Alice can move her chip down, down-left, or down-right.
- Bob can move his chip up, up-left, or up-right.

The game ends when:
- A player moves their chip to the same position as the opponent's chip, resulting in a win for that player.
- A player cannot make any more moves, resulting in a draw.

### Key Observations

1. **Initial Positions**: The chips start at different positions.
2. **Movement Constraints**: Each player can only move within the board boundaries.
3. **Winning Condition**: A player wins if they can force their chip onto the opponent's chip's position.
4. **Drawing Condition**: If a player reaches the edge of the board without being able to capture the opponent's chip, the game ends in a draw.

### Strategy

The strategy revolves around the relative positions of Alice and Bob and their ability to reach each other's positions within the constraints of their movement.

- If Alice is initially above Bob (`xa < xb`), Alice can potentially move down towards Bob.
- If Alice is initially below Bob (`xa > xb`), Bob can potentially move up towards Alice.
- If Alice and Bob are on the same row (`xa == xb`), the game can only end in a draw because neither can move vertically towards the other.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program logic:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
```

#### Case 1: `xa > xb`
- If Alice starts below Bob, the program immediately prints 'Draw'. This is incorrect because Alice could still potentially win if she can move up to Bob's position within the constraints.

#### Case 2: `xa <= xb`
- The program calculates `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`, which represents half the vertical distance between Alice and Bob.
- If the distance is odd (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`), it calculates the range `[l, r]` where Bob can be horizontally positioned such that Alice can potentially reach him.
- If the distance is even, it calculates the range `[l, r]` where Alice can be horizontally positioned such that Bob can potentially reach her.
- The program then checks if Alice or Bob can reach the opponent's position within the calculated range and prints the winner accordingly.

### Conclusion

The program incorrectly handles the case where `xa > xb`. In this scenario, Alice should have the opportunity to win if she can move up to Bob's position within the constraints. Therefore, the program's logic is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
