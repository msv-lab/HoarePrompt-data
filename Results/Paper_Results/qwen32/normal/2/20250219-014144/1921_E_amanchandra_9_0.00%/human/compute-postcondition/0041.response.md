Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives six integers: `h` (height), `w` (width), `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` (coordinates of two points). The function returns a result for each test case based on the given coordinates and dimensions, ensuring that the coordinates are valid and that the points are not the same.**
