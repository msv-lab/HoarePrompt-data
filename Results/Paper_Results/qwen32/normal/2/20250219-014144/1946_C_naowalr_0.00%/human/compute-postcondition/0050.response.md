The code appends the integer `b` to the list located at index `a` in the list `adj`. This means that the list at `adj[a]` now contains `b`.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the list at `adj[a]` has been updated to include `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` contains `b`; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is 1; `R` is 2; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input.**
