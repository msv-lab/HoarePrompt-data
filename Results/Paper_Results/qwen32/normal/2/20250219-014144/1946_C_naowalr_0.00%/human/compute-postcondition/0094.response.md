The code snippet appends the integer `b` to the list located at index `a` in the list `adj`. Given that `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, the list `adj` must already exist and be large enough to accommodate an index `a`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2; `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input; `adj[a]` includes `b` appended to its previous contents.**
