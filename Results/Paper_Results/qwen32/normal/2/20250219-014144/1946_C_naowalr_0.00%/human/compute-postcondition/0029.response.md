To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop statement. The loop continues as long as `R - L > 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n.
- `x` is 50001.
- `leftover` is 42.
- If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` remains 100001. Otherwise, `L` remains 1, `R` is set to 50001, and `numCuts` is 1.

We need to ensure that `R - L > 1` for the loop to execute one more time. Let's analyze the possible values of `L` and `R`:

1. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` remains 100001. In this case, `R - L = 100001 - 50001 = 50000`, which satisfies the condition `R - L > 1`.
2. Otherwise, `L` remains 1 and `R` is set to 50001, and `numCuts` is 1. In this case, `R - L = 50001 - 1 = 50000`, which also satisfies the condition `R - L > 1`.

In both scenarios, the condition `R - L > 1` is satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the states of `L` and `R` to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is 42; If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is 50001 and `R` remains 100001. Otherwise, `L` remains 1, `R` is set to 50001, and `numCuts` is 1.**
