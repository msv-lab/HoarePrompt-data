Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each `adj[a]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `a` as specified by the input pairs; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `i` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each `adj[a]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `a` as specified by the input pairs; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is either 50001 or 100001; `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x` if `numCuts` is equal to `k`; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `i` is `n - 1`; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. Specifically, if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is set to 50001 and `R` remains 100001. Otherwise, `L` remains 1 and `R` is set to 50001.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each `adj[a]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `a` as specified by the input pairs; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is either 50001, 100001, 25001, or 75001; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `i` is `n - 1`; `x` is either 25001 or 75001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `R` remains 50001 or 100001. Otherwise, `R` is set to `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each `adj[a]` contains all the nodes directly connected to node `a` as specified by the input pairs; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is either 1 or 50001; `R` is either 50001 or 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `i` is `n - 1`; `x` is either 50001 or 75001; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), the program takes the path specified in the if part. Otherwise, it takes the path specified in the else part, which in this case does not alter any of the variables.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
