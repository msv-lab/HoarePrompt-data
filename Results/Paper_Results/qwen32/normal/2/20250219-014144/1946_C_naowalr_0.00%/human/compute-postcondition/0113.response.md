The code snippet assigns the value of `x` to `L`. Given that `x` is 50001, `L` will now hold the value 50001. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all integers connected to `x` from the input pairs; `L` is 50001; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is greater than `k` or `numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`; `z` remains unchanged; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`**
