The code appends the integer `b` to the list `adj[a]`. This means that the list `adj[a]` now includes `b` as one of its elements, along with any other elements it originally contained.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` contains `b` and possibly other elements, `adj[b]` contains `a` and possibly other elements, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is the second integer read from input, `L` is 1, `R` is 2, `numCuts` is 0, `z` is 1, `t` is some integer greater than 1, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input, `i` is 2.**
