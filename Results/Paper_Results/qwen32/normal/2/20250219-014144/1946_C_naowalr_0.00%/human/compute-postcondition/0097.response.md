The provided code snippet reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `adj`, or `i` directly. The only change is that `a` and `b` are updated with new values read from the input.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2; `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input; `adj[a]` includes `b` appended to its previous contents; `adj[b]` includes `a` appended to its previous contents; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Natural Language: The values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the integers read from the input. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
