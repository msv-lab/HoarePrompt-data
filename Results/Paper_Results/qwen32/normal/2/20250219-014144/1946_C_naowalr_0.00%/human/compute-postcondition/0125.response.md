The code snippet reassigns the value of `x` to `(L + R) // 2`. Given the initial state, `L` is 1 and `R` is 3. Therefore, the new value of `x` will be `(1 + 3) // 2`, which equals 2.

No other variables are affected by this operation. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `z` remains unchanged, `x` is 2, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `R` is 3**.
