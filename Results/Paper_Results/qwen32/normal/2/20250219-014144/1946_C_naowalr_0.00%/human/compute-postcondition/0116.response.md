Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 1`; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `x` contains all integers connected to `x` from the input pairs; `z` remains unchanged; `x` is 50001; `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50001, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` with the additional condition that if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**
