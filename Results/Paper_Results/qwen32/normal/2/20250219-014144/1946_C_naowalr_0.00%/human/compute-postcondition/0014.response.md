The code appends `b` to the list at index `a` in the adjacency list `adj`. This means that the list at index `a` will now include `b` as an additional element.

Given the initial state, the list at index `a` originally contained `b`, and the list at index `b` contained both `b` and `a`. After executing the code, the list at index `a` will have `b` appended to it, resulting in two occurrences of `b` in the list at index `a`.

Other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` twice, and the list at index `b` contains `b` and `a`; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `i` is 4.**
