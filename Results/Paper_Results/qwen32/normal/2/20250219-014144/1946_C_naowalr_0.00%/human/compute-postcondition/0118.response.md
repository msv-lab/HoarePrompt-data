Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `z` remains unchanged, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is compared against `k` and `leftover` is compared against `x` to set `L` and `R` such that `R - L > 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` has been updated to be the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. All other variables retain their initial states or conditions.
