The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This affects the values of `a` and `b`, but does not change the values of any other variables.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is 1; `R` is 2; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input.**
