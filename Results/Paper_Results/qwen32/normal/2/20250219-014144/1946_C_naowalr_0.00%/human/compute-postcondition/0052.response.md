The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 0 (since it's the first iteration). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` contains `b` and `adj[b]` contains `a`; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is 1; `R` is 2; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input; `i` is 1**
