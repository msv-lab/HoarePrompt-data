To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `R - L > 1`. The variables `R` and `L` are the only ones that can be adjusted based on the loop head.

Given the current state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists
- `z` remains unchanged
- `x` is 50001
- `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`
- `numCuts` is compared against `k` and `leftover` is compared against `x` to set `L` and `R`.

We need to ensure that `R - L > 1` holds true for the loop to continue executing.

From the problem description, we know:
- If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L = 50001` and `R = 100001`.
- Otherwise, `L = 1` and `R = 50001`.

To make sure the loop executes one more time, we need to ensure that `R - L > 1`. This means we should set `L` and `R` such that their difference is greater than 1.

Let's consider both scenarios:

1. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`):
   - `L = 50001`
   - `R = 100001`
   - `R - L = 100001 - 50001 = 50000`, which is greater than 1.

2. Otherwise:
   - `L = 1`
   - `R = 50001`
   - `R - L = 50001 - 1 = 50000`, which is greater than 1.

In both cases, `R - L > 1` holds true. Therefore, no further adjustments are needed to the values of `L` and `R` to ensure the loop continues executing.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `z` remains unchanged, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is compared against `k` and `leftover` is compared against `x` to set `L` and `R` such that `R - L > 1`**
