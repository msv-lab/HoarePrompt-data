The code appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. This means that the list `adj[b]` now includes `a` as one of its elements. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` contains `b` and `adj[b]` contains `a`; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is the second integer read from input; `L` is 1; `R` is 2; `numCuts` is 0; `z` is 1; `t` is some integer greater than 1; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from input.**
