The code calculates the midpoint between `L` and `R` and assigns it to `x`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the value of `x` will be `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which equals 50001. The other variables (`adj`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `R`, and `numCuts`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the vertices `b` that are directly connected to `a` by an edge; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer such that 0 < k < n; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is 50001.**
