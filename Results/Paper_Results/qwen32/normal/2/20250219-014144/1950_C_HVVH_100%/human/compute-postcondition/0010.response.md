The code snippet simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `day`. None of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `h`, `m`) are modified by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time string converted to an integer and reduced by 12, `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer, `h` is now between 1 and 12 (inclusive).**
