The code snippet `h = h - 12` reduces the value of `h` by 12. Given the initial state, `h` is initially greater than 12 and not equal to 0. After subtracting 12 from `h`, the new value of `h` will be between 1 and 12 (inclusive), because `h` was originally between 13 and 24.

Other variables (`t`, `s`, `day`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the hour part of the input time string converted to an integer and reduced by 12, `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer, `h` is now between 1 and 12 (inclusive).**
