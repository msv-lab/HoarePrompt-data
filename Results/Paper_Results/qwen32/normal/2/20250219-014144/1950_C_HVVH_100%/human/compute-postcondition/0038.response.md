Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". `h` and `m` are the integer values extracted from the input string "hh:mm". `day` is 'PM'. `n` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `day` has been changed from 'AM' to 'PM'. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `h`, `m`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
