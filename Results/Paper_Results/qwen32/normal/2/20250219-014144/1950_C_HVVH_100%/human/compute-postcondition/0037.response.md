The code sets the variable `day` to the string `'AM'`. This change affects only the `day` variable, while all other variables (`t`, `s`, `h`, `m`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". `h` and `m` are the integer values extracted from the input string "hh:mm". `day` is 'AM'. `n` is unchanged.**
