The code snippet assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `day`. This change affects only the variable `day`, while the other variables (`t`, `s`, `h`, `m`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". `h` is 12, `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer. `day` is 'AM', `n` is unchanged.**
