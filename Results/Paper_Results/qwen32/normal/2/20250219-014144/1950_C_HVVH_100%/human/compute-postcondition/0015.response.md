Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm". If `h` (the hour part of the input time string converted to an integer) equals 12, then `day` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains unchanged. `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is not equal to 0, and `h` is less than or equal to 12. `m` is the minute part of the input time string converted to an integer.**
