To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions.

The loop increments `left` as long as `left` is less than the length of the string `s` and the character at index `left` in `s` is not `'1'`. This means the loop will stop when it either reaches the end of the string or encounters a `'1'`.

From the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:

- After the first iteration, `left` is 1, which means `s[0]` was not `'1'`.
- After the second iteration, `left` is 2, which means `s[1]` was not `'1'`.
- After the third iteration, `left` is 3, which means `s[2]` was not `'1'`.

This pattern indicates that `left` will continue to increment until it finds a `'1'` or reaches the end of the string.

Therefore, the final state of `left` will be the smallest index such that `left >= len(s)` or `s[left] == '1'`.

### Final Output State:
- `right` remains the smallest index such that `right >= len(s)` or `s[right] == '0'`.
- `left` will be the smallest index such that `left >= len(s)` or `s[left] == '1'`.
- `s` and `cost` remain unchanged unless the swap condition is met outside the loop.

In natural language, this means `left` will point to the first occurrence of `'1'` in the string `s`, or it will be equal to the length of `s` if there are no `'1'` characters in `s`.

Output State: **`right` is the smallest index such that `right >= len(s)` or `s[right] == '0'`; `left` is the smallest index such that `left >= len(s)` or `s[left] == '1'`; `s` and `cost` remain unchanged unless the swap condition is met outside the loop.**
