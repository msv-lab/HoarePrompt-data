Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list containing all the elements from `sChar` in the same order.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the list `s` will contain all the strings from the list `sChar` in the exact same order they appeared in `sChar`.
