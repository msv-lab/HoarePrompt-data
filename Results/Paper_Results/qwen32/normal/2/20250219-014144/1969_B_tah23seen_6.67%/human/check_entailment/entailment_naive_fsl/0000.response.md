Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shift operations. Here is a detailed analysis of why the program is incorrect:

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Cyclic Shifts**: The code attempts to swap '0's and '1's directly, which does not accurately simulate the cyclic shift operation described in the problem statement. The cost calculation `(right - left + 1)` is applied whenever a '0' and a '1' are swapped, but this does not reflect the actual cost of performing a cyclic shift on a substring.

2. **Handling of Multiple Swaps**: The code does not handle multiple swaps correctly. It only performs a single swap between the first '1' it encounters and the first '0' it encounters, and then continues searching for the next pair. This approach does not consider the possibility of performing multiple cyclic shifts on different substrings to achieve the desired sorted order.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The code does not handle cases where the string is already sorted or nearly sorted. For example, a string like "0011" would require no operations, but the code might incorrectly calculate a non-zero cost.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input string "11000":
- The correct minimum cost to sort this string is 9, as shown in the example.
- However, the provided code will likely not produce the correct result because it does not properly simulate the cyclic shift operations and their associated costs.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one needs to consider the following:
- Identify the blocks of '1's and '0's in the string.
- Calculate the cost of moving each block of '1's to the end of the string using the minimum number of cyclic shifts.
- Sum up the costs of these operations to get the total minimum cost.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
