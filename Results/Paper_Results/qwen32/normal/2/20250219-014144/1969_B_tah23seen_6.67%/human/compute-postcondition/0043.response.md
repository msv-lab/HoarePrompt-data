To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. `left < len(s)`
2. `s[left] != '1'`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `left` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not '1', incremented by 1.
- `right` is the index of the first '0' after the initial '1' or the length of `s` if no '0' is found.
- `s` remains unchanged.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `left < len(s)`**: This condition ensures that `left` is within the bounds of the string `s`. Since `left` is already calculated based on the string `s`, this condition should naturally hold unless `left` has been incremented beyond the length of `s`. However, since the problem specifies that `left` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not '1', incremented by 1, it implies that `left` should be within the valid range of indices for `s`.

2. **Condition `s[left] != '1'`**: This condition checks that the character at index `left` in `s` is not '1'. Since `left` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not '1', incremented by 1, it means that `s[left - 1]` was not '1', but `s[left]` could potentially be '1' or out of bounds (if `left` equals `len(s)`).

### Adjustment:
To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `s[left]` is not '1' and that `left` is still within the bounds of `s`. Given that `left` is already incremented by 1 from the index of the first character that is not '1', we need to ensure that `left` points to a character that is not '1'.

Since `left` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `s[left - 1]` was not '1' and `s[left]` is also not '1'. However, since `left` is already calculated based on the string `s`, the only way to ensure that the loop can execute one more time is to adjust `left` such that it points to a character that is not '1' and is within the bounds of `s`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `left` such that it points to a character that is not '1' and is within the bounds of `s`. Since `left` is already incremented by 1 from the index of the first character that is not '1', we need to ensure that `s[left]` is not '1'.

State: **`left` must point to an index in `s` where `s[left]` is not '1' and `left` is less than `len(s)`**. 

However, since `left` is already incremented by 1 from the index of the first character that is not '1', we can simply state that `left` should be decremented by 1 to point to the last known index that was not '1', ensuring that `s[left]` is not '1'.

State: **`left` is decremented by 1 to point to the last known index that was not '1'**. 

But since the problem asks us to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head and we cannot assume the exact previous value of `left`, the most accurate state adjustment would be:

State: **`left` is adjusted such that `s[left]` is not '1' and `left` is less than `len(s)`**. 

Given the constraints, the most straightforward adjustment would be:

State: **`left` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not '1'**. 

This ensures that `s[left]` is not '1' and `left` is within the bounds of `s`.

State: **`left` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not '1'**.
