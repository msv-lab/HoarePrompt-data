The value of `left` is incremented by 1. Given that the initial value of `left` is 2, after executing `left += 1`, the value of `left` becomes 3. The other variables (`right`, `s`, `cost`) remain unchanged as per the conditions provided.

Output State: **`right` is the smallest index such that `right >= len(s)` or `s[right] == '0'`; `left` is 3; `s[1]` is not `'1'`; `s[2]` is not `'1'`; `len(s)` is greater than 2; `s` and `cost` remain unchanged unless the swap condition is met outside the loop.**
