The code snippet `s.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `s`. Given that `s` was initially an empty list, after executing this line, `s` will contain one element, which is the value of `i`.

Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `s` will now have one element.

The other variable `sChar` remains unchanged as per the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of only '0's and '1's, and the length of each string `s` satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `sChar` must contain at least one string; `s` is a list containing one element `i`.**
