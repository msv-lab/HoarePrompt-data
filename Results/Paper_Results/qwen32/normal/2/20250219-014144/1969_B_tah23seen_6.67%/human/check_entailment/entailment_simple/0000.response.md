### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem of sorting a binary string using cyclic shifts with minimal cost. However, there are several issues with the logic that prevent it from correctly calculating the minimum cost:

1. **Incorrect Swapping Mechanism**: The code tries to swap '0's and '1's when they are encountered in the wrong order. However, this approach does not account for the actual cost of performing a cyclic shift on a substring. Instead, it simply swaps the characters and adds the distance between them to the cost, which does not reflect the true cost of a cyclic shift operation.

2. **Logic for Finding '0's and '1's**: The nested while loops increment `right` until a '0' is found and `left` until a '1' is found. This mechanism is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of multiple consecutive '0's or '1's and does not handle the situation where `right` might pass `left`.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is incorrect because it does not simulate the actual cyclic shift operation. The cost should be the length of the substring being shifted, but the current implementation incorrectly adds the distance between `left` and `right` to the cost.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases effectively, such as strings that are already sorted or strings with all '0's or all '1's.

### Correctness:

Given the above issues, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
