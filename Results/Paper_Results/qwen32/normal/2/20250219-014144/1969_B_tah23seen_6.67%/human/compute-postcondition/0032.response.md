The code snippet `cost += right - left + 1` modifies the value of `cost` by adding the expression `right - left + 1` to it. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged, and the string `s` also remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if there are no '1's.
- `right` is equal to `left`.

The new value of `cost` will be its previous value plus `right - left + 1`. Since `right` is equal to `left`, the expression simplifies to `cost += 1`.

Output State: **`left` is the index of the first '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if there are no '1's; `right` is equal to `left`; `cost` is increased by 1; `s` remains unchanged.**
