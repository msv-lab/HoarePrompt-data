The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` based on the user's input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `check` is 2147483647.**
