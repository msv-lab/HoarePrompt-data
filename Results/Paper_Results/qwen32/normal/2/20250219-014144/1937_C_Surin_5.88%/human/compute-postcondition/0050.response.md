To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list.
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v1` is the largest index `i` for which `r == '<'` was observed during the loop iterations.
- `prev` is the last index `i` for which `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such `i` was found.
- `i` is initialized to `n`.

### Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `prev` is initialized to the last index `i` where `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such `i` was found.
- `v1` is the largest index `i` where `r == '<'` was observed during the loop iterations.

However, the problem does not specify any loop or the value of `r` at different indices, so we must assume that these variables (`prev` and `v1`) have their default or initial values unless specified otherwise.

Given that:
- `prev` is initialized to 0 (since no observation of `r == '>'` is mentioned).
- `v1` is not explicitly set to any value other than its default, which is likely 0 (assuming no observation of `r == '<'` is mentioned).

Thus, the values of `prev` and `v1` are both 0.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output:
Output: **! 0 0**
