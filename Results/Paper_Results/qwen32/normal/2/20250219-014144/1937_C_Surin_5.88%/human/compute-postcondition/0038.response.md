To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. This represents the number of test cases but does not directly influence the current print statement.
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 1. This indicates the length of the permutation `p`.
3. **`p`**: A permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. This is a list of integers from 0 to n-1 in some order, but its specific values do not affect the current print statement.
4. **`I`**: A lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list.
5. **`R`**: A lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer.
6. **`g`**: Initialized to 0. This variable is not used in the print statement.
7. **`v1`**: The largest index `i` for which `r` == '<' was observed during the loop iterations. Initially, this value is not explicitly set, so it would be `None` or some default value unless set within the loop.
8. **`prev`**: Set to `i` if `r` equals '>', otherwise `prev` remains unchanged. Similar to `v1`, this value is not explicitly set initially.
9. **`r`**: The input string. This variable holds the current character read from the input, either '<' or '>'.
10. **`i`**: Incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Initially, `i` is not explicitly set, so it would be 0 unless set within the loop.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Given the initial state, we don't have explicit values for `v1`, `i`, and `prev` because they are determined within the loop. However, we can describe their roles and typical values based on the logic described:

- **`v1`**: This is the largest index `i` where `r` was '<'. If no '<' was encountered, `v1` might remain at its initial value (which could be `None` or some default value like -1 if initialized).
- **`i`**: This is the current index in the loop, incremented by 1 with each iteration. At the point of printing, `i` will be the last index processed.
- **`prev`**: This is the index `i` where `r` was '>'. If no '>' was encountered, `prev` might remain at its initial value (which could be `None` or some default value like -1 if initialized).

Since the exact values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev` depend on the input and the loop iterations, we can't provide exact numerical values. However, we can describe them based on their roles.

### Final Output Description:
Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the largest index i for which r == '<', i is the current index, and prev is the index i for which r == '>')**

This description captures the roles and typical values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev` based on the given initial state and logic.
