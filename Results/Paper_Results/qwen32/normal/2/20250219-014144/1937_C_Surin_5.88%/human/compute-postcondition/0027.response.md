Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is 5, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v2` is 3, `i` is 3, `r` is the new input string. If `r` equals `<`, then `v1` is set to 4. Otherwise, `v1` remains unchanged (which is 3).**
