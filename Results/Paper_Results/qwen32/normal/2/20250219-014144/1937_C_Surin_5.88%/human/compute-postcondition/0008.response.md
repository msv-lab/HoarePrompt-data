Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list.
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is `i`.

### Key Points:
- The value of `v1` is explicitly given as 0.
- The value of `v2` is stated to be `i`, but there is no mention of `i` being defined anywhere in the initial state. This suggests that `i` might be a typo or a placeholder, and since it's not defined, we can assume it should be a specific value or a variable that should have been defined earlier. However, based on the given information, we'll treat `v2` as `i` as per the precondition.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is `i`, but since `i` is not defined, we can't determine its exact value from the given information. However, if we assume `i` is a placeholder for a value that should have been defined, and considering the pattern in the print statement, it seems like `v2` should be the same as `v1` unless specified otherwise. Since `v1` is 0, and there's no additional context to suggest otherwise, we'll treat `v2` as 0 as well.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of a specific definition for `i` and assuming the simplest interpretation where `v2` should match `v1` based on the symmetry in the print statement, we can infer that `v2` is also 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 0 0 0**
