To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
2. **n**: An integer greater than 1.
3. **p**: A permutation of the set \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\).
4. **I**: A lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list.
5. **R**: A lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer.
6. **g**: Initialized to 0.
7. **v1**: Set to the new input integer `i` if `r` equals `<`, otherwise `v1` remains 0.
8. **prev**: The last index `i` for which `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such `i` was found.
9. **i**: The new input integer + 1.
10. **kp**: Initialized to 1.
11. **v2**: Set to the new input integer `i`.
12. **r**: The input string.

### Key Variables for the Print Statement:
- **v1**: This variable is set to the new input integer `i` if `r` equals `<`, otherwise it remains 0.
- **v2**: This variable is set to the new input integer `i`.

### Analysis:
- The print statement is `print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')`.
- Since `v1` is either 0 or the new input integer `i` (if `r` is `<`), and `v2` is the new input integer `i`, the output will depend on the value of `r` and the input integer `i`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. If `r` is not `<`, then `v1` remains 0.
2. If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is set to the new input integer `i`.
3. Regardless of the value of `r`, `v2` is always set to the new input integer `i`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the output will be:
- If `r` is not `<`, the output will be `? 0 0 i i`.
- If `r` is `<`, the output will be `? i i i i`.

Since the exact value of `r` and the new input integer `i` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] (where v1 is the new input integer i if r equals '<', otherwise v1 is 0, and v2 is the new input integer i)**
