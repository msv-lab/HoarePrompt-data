The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the new input integer + 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 again.

Given the provided state, the only adjustment needed is to increment `i` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the new input integer `i` if `r` equals '<', otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the last index `i` for which `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is the new input integer + 2, `kp` is 1, `v2` is the new input integer `i`, `r` is the input string. Specifically, if `r` equals '<', `v1` is set to the new input integer `i`; otherwise, `v1` remains unchanged.**

Note: The value of `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, so if it was `new input integer + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `new input integer + 2` at the start of the next iteration. To reflect the correct state before the next iteration starts, we consider `i` as `new input integer + 1` again, ready to be incremented.

Therefore, the correct state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the new input integer `i` if `r` equals '<', otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the last index `i` for which `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is the new input integer + 1, `kp` is 1, `v2` is the new input integer `i`, `r` is the input string. Specifically, if `r` equals '<', `v1` is set to the new input integer `i`; otherwise, `v1` remains unchanged.**
