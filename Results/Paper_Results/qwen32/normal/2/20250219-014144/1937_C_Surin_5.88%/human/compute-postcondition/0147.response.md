The code snippet `r = input()` reads a new input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `i` is 3, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is the highest index `i` for which the response `r` was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` was found, `r` is the new input received from the user, and `prev` is set based on the value of `r` as described.**
