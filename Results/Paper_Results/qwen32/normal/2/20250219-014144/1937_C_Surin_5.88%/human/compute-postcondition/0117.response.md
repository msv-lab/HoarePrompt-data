To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}.
- `I` and `R` are lambda functions (their definitions are not provided).
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `>` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found.
- `i` is initialized to `n-2`.
- `kp` is initialized to 2.
- `v2` is initialized to `n-2`.
- If `r` is `<`, then `v1` is `n-1`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `v2` is explicitly set to `n-2`.
- `v1` is only defined if `r` is `<`, but since there is no information about `r` being `<` in the initial state, we assume `v1` is not explicitly set by this condition. However, since `v1` must have a value to be printed, we infer that `v1` could be any value that was assigned previously or by default. Given the context and typical usage, we assume `v1` would be `n-1` if `r` was `<` at some point, but since it's not specified, we consider the most likely scenario based on the provided conditions.

Given the lack of explicit assignment of `v1` in the initial state and the typical usage pattern, we assume `v1` is `n-1` based on the condition `if r is <, then v1 is n-1`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the values of `v1` and `v2` are:
- `v1` is `n-1`.
- `v2` is `n-2`.

Thus, the print statement will output:
Output: **? n-1 n-1 n-2 n-2**
