The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same.

Given that the loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k+1`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we assume it to be `k` where `1 ≤ k < n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k+1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to `v2` and `v2` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged, `i` is `k+1` where `1 ≤ k < n`**.

To simplify, if we consider the last iteration had `i` as `n-2`, then the next iteration would have `i` as `n-1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to `v2` and `v2` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged, `i` is `n-1`**

However, since we are not given the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the most general form is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to `v2` and `v2` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged, `i` is `k+1` where `1 ≤ k < n`**. 

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `i` was `3` at the end of the previous iteration and `n` is `5`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is 5, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0. If `r` equals '<', then `v1` is set to `v2` and `v2` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged, `i` is 4**.
