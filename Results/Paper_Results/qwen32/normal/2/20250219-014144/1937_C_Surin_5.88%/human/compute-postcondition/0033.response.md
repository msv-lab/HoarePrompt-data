The code snippet `r = input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `I`, `R`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which r == '<' was observed during the loop iterations, `prev` is 0, `r` is the input string.**
