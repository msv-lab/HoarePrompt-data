The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Given that `i` is initially `n-2`, after the assignment, `v2` will also be `n-2`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `prev` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `>` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is `n-2`, `kp` is 2, `v2` is `n-2`, and if `r` is `<`, then `v1` is `n-1`.**
