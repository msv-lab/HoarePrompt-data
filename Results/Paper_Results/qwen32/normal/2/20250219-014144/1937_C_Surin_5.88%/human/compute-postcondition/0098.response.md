Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function, `R` is a lambda function, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index `i` for which the response `r` was `<` during the loop iterations, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `prev` is 3, `i` is 3, `kp` is 1, and `r` is the user input.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `prev` has been updated to 3, while all other variables retain their initial values.
