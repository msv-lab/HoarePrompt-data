The code snippet `r = input('')` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `r` is the input string.**
