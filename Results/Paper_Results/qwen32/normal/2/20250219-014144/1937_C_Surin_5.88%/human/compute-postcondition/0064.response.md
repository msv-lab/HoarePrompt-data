The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (not inclusive), meaning `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is greater than 1
- `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}
- `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list
- `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the new input integer `i` if `r` equals '<', otherwise `v1` remains 0
- `prev` is the last index `i` for which `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such `i` was found
- `i` is the new input integer
- `kp` is 1
- `v2` is the new input integer `i`
- `r` is the input string

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken some value between 1 and `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., `n`-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the new input integer `i` if `r` equals '<', otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the last index `i` for which `r == '>'` was observed, or 0 if no such `i` was found, `i` is the new input integer + 1, `kp` is 1, `v2` is the new input integer `i`, `r` is the input string**
