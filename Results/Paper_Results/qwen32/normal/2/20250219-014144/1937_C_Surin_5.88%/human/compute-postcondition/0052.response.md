The only variable in the loop head is `kp`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop iterating over `range(int(input()))`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `kp`.

Given that `kp` is currently `n` (from the state at the end of the previous iteration), this implies that the loop has completed all its iterations up to `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `kp` should be incremented by 1, assuming there are more iterations to perform.

However, the loop condition is `kp in range(int(input()))`, which means `kp` should be less than the integer read from the input. Since `kp` is currently `n`, for the loop to execute again, `int(input())` must be greater than `n`. Therefore, `kp` should be reset to 0 for the next set of iterations if there are any.

But since the task specifies only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, and given that `kp` is the only loop variable, we simply increment `kp` by 1 to start the next iteration, assuming `int(input())` allows it.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which r == '<' was observed during the loop iterations, `prev` is the last index i for which r == '>' was observed, or 0 if no such i was found, and `i` is n, `kp` is 0** (if starting a new set of iterations) or `kp` is incremented by 1 (if continuing the same set of iterations).

Since the problem does not specify whether `kp` should reset or continue incrementing within the same set of iterations, and considering the loop head only contains `kp`, we assume the simplest case where `kp` is incremented by 1:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which r == '<' was observed during the loop iterations, `prev` is the last index i for which r == '>' was observed, or 0 if no such i was found, and `i` is n, `kp` is 1**
