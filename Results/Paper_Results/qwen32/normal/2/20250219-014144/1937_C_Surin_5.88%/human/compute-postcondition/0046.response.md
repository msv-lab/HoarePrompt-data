The code snippet `r = input()` reads a line of input and assigns it to the variable `r`. This means that the value of `r` changes from its previous state (which could be any string) to the new input string.

All other variables remain unchanged. Specifically:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` remains an integer greater than 1.
- `p` remains a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
- `I` remains a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list.
- `R` remains a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer.
- `g` remains 0.
- `v1` remains the largest index i for which `r` == '<' was observed during the loop iterations.
- `i` remains `i + 1` where `i + 1` is less than `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest index i for which `r` == '<' was observed during the loop iterations, `r` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1` where `i + 1` is less than `n`.**
