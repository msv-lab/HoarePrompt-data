To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 1.
   - `p`: A permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
   - `I`: A lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list.
   - `R`: A lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer.
   - `g`: Initialized to 0.
   - `v1`: The largest index `i` for which `r == '<'` was observed during the loop iterations.
   - `r`: The input string.
   - `i`: Incremented by 1 during loop iterations, starting from an initial value (not explicitly stated but implied to start from 0).

2. **Loop Context:**
   - The loop iterates over indices from 0 to `n-1`.
   - During each iteration, the value of `r` is read (presumably from input).
   - If `r == '<'`, `v1` is updated to the current index `i`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```
   - `v1`: The largest index `i` where `r == '<'` was observed.
   - `i`: The current index in the loop.
   - `prev`: Not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it must be defined elsewhere in the code (likely in the loop).

### Explanation:
- **`v1`**: This variable holds the largest index `i` where the character `'<'` was encountered in the input string `r` during the loop iterations.
- **`i`**: This variable represents the current index in the loop. When the print statement is executed, `i` would be the index after the last iteration of the loop, which is `n` if the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`.
- **`prev`**: This variable is not defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is defined somewhere in the loop. Typically, `prev` could be the previous value of `r` or another variable that tracks something from the previous iteration.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will depend on the specific values of `v1`, `i`, and `prev` at the point where the print statement is executed. Since `i` is the loop index and the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`, `i` will be `n` when the print statement is executed. `v1` will be the largest index where `r == '<'` was observed, and `prev` will be whatever value it held at the end of the loop.

Since the exact values of `v1` and `prev` are not specified in the initial state, we can only describe them in terms of their definitions.

Output: **? [v1] [n] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the largest index i for which r == '<' was observed, n is the total number of iterations, and prev is the value of the variable prev at the end of the loop)**
