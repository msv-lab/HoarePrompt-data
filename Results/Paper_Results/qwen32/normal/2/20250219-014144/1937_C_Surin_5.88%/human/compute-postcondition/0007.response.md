The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `v2`. However, we know that `v2` will take on whatever value `i` holds.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split element into an integer, returning these integers as a list, `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input and converts it to an integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`.**
