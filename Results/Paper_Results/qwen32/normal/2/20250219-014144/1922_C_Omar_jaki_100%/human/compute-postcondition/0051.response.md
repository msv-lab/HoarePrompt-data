The value of `v` is updated to be `y - x`. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`b` is `[0, 0, y - x, y - x]`, `w` is the next element after the current `w` in `a`, `x` is the next element after the current `x` in `a`, `y` is the next element after the current `y` in `a`, `z` is the next element after the current `z` in `a`**.

This means that the list `b` now has `y - x` as its third and fourth elements, while the other variables remain unchanged.
