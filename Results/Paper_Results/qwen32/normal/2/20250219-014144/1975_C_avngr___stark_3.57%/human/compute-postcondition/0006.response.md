Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ \(10^9\). The minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is greater than `max`. The current value of `max` is less than the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.**
