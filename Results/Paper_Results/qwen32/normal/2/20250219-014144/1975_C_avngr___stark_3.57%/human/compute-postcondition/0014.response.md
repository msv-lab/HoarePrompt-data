Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an integer greater than 4; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ \(10^9\); `i` is 4. If `min(a[4], a[3])` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to `min(a[4], a[3])`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
