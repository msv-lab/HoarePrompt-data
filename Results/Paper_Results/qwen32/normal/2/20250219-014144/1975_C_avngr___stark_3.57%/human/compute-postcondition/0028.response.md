To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ \(10^9\)
- `i` is 2
- If `min(a[2], a[1]) > max`, then `max` is updated to the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`

Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` in the next iteration should be 3 (as `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration).

The variable `n` does not change throughout the loop iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ \(10^9\); `i` is 3**
