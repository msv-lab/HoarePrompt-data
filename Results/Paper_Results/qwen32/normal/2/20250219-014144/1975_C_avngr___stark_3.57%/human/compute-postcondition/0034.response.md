The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `_` is incremented by 1, but since `_` is not defined or used in the code snippet, it does not affect the execution of this code. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `n` which holds the integer value from the user input.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer**.
