The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop does not directly depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `max` for its continuation. The loop will continue as long as `_` is less than `t`.

Given that the loop iterates `t` times, at the start of each iteration, `_` takes on the next integer value starting from 0 up to `t-1`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we simply need to increment `_` by 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` was some value, let's call it `k`, where `0 ≤ k < t`.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be `k + 1`.
3. Since `t` remains unchanged and the other variables (`n`, `a`, `max`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need adjustment for the loop to continue, we only need to adjust `_`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ \(10^9\); `max` is the maximum value among all the minimum pairs `(a[i], a[i-1])` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-1`; `_` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Since we don't know the exact value of `k` (other than it being the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration), we can generalize this to just incrementing `_` by 1 from its previous value.

So the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ \(10^9\); `max` is the maximum value among all the minimum pairs `(a[i], a[i-1])` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-1`; `_` is incremented by 1.**
