The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` was previously an integer between 2 and \(10^5\). After executing this line, `n` will be reassigned to whatever integer value is provided by the input.

Since the input value is not specified in the problem statement, we cannot determine a specific new value for `n`. However, we know that `n` will now hold the integer value provided by the user input.

The other variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `n` is the integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ \(10^9\). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).**
