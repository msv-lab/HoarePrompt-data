### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) initial moves, considering the rules for placing rooks and the mirroring behavior of the computer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - It then reads the \( k \) moves, each consisting of two integers \( r_i \) and \( c_i \).

2. **Counting Moves on and Off the Diagonal:**
   - The variable `num` keeps track of the number of moves that are either on the diagonal (\( r_i = c_i \)) or off the diagonal.
     - If a move is on the diagonal, `num` is incremented by 1.
     - If a move is off the diagonal, `num` is incremented by 2 (since the computer mirrors the move, effectively occupying two cells).

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - The variable `m` represents the number of remaining cells on the board that are not occupied by rooks after the initial \( k \) moves.
   - This is calculated as \( m = n - num \).

4. **Determining the Number of Configurations:**
   - If \( m = 0 \), it means all cells are occupied, so there are no further configurations possible, and the result is `0`.
   - If \( m = 1 \), there is only one cell left, and it can be occupied by a single rook, resulting in `1` configuration.
   - For \( m > 1 \), the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks without them attacking each other.
     - The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized with base cases \( dp[1] = 1 \) and \( dp[2] = 3 \).
     - For each subsequent \( i \) from 3 to \( m \), the value of `dp[i]` is computed based on the previous values, ensuring that the result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

5. **Output:**
   - The result for each test case is printed.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the special cases where all cells are occupied or only one cell is left correctly. For the general case, it uses dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations efficiently, taking into account the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
