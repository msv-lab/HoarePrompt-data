You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of size `n` and a series of `k` moves specified by coordinates `(r_i, c_i)`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the number of moves and their positions relative to the grid's diagonal. If all moves are on the diagonal, the result is `0`. If exactly one cell is off the diagonal, the result is `1`. Otherwise, it computes a more complex value using dynamic programming, which represents the number of ways to arrange the remaining cells under certain conditions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Chessboard Setup**: An `n x n` chessboard.
2. **Turns**: Players alternate turns placing rooks.
   - Player places a white rook at `(r, c)`.
   - Computer mirrors the move by placing a black rook at `(c, r)` unless `r == c`, in which case the computer skips its turn.
3. **Constraints**: No two rooks can attack each other (same row or column).
4. **Objective**: Calculate the number of distinct final configurations after `k` initial moves, considering all possible subsequent moves.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each with an `n x n` chessboard and `k` initial moves. For each test case, it calculates the number of distinct final configurations using dynamic programming.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the chessboard) and `k` (number of initial moves).
2. **Processing Moves**: For each of the `k` moves, it checks if `r == c`. If so, it increments `num` by 1 (indicating a skipped move). Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2 (indicating two positions are occupied).
3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**: `m = n - num` represents the number of unoccupied positions.
4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - If `m == 0`, there are no valid configurations, so it prints `0`.
   - If `m == 1`, there is only one configuration, so it prints `1`.
   - For `m > 1`, it uses a dynamic programming array `dp` to calculate the number of configurations:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: One configuration with one rook.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: Three configurations with two rooks.
     - For `i >= 3`, it calculates `dp[i]` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Initial Moves Handling**: The program correctly handles the initial moves and calculates `num` based on whether `r == c`.
2. **Remaining Positions Calculation**: The calculation of `m = n - num` seems correct.
3. **Dynamic Programming Formula**: The formula used for `dp[i]` appears to be derived from combinatorial logic, but it needs to be verified for correctness.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Small Boards**: When `n` is small (e.g., `n = 1`), the program should handle this correctly.
   - **No Initial Moves (`k = 0`)**: The program should handle this scenario correctly.
   - **All Moves Skipped (`r == c` for all moves)**: The program should handle this scenario correctly.
   - **Maximum Constraints**: The program should handle the maximum constraints (`n = 3 * 10^5`).

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 4`, `k = 1`, Move: `(1, 2)`
  - `num = 2` (one move, not skipped).
  - `m = 2`.
  - `dp[2] = 3`, which matches the expected output.
  
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 8`, `k = 1`, Move: `(7, 6)`
  - `num = 2` (one move, not skipped).
  - `m = 6`.
  - `dp[6] = 331`, which matches the expected output.
  
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 1000`, `k = 4`, Moves: `(4, 4)`, `(952, 343)`, `(222, 333)`, `(90, 91)`
  - `num = 6` (two moves skipped, two moves not skipped).
  - `m = 994`.
  - `dp[994] = 671968183`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and verification of the test cases, the program appears to correctly handle the problem description and constraints. There are no evident issues with the logic or edge cases.

Explanation: The program correctly processes the initial moves, calculates the number of remaining positions, and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of distinct final configurations.
