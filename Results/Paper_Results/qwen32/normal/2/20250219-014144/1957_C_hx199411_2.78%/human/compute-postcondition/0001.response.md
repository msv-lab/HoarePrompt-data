To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head. The loop is defined as:

```python
while t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is non-zero (i.e., `t` is truthy). Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4;
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5;
- `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n;
- Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n;
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Since `t` is already specified to be within the range 1 to 10^4, it inherently satisfies the condition `t > 0`. Thus, no adjustment is needed for `t`.

No other variables (`n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`) are part of the loop condition, so they do not need to be modified.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n; each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
