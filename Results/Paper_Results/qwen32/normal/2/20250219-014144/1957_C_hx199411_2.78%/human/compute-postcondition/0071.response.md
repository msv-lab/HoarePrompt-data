The `print(1)` statement in the given Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The `print` function will simply output the integer `1`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, `m`, `dp`), but none of these affect the `print(1)` statement.
- The `print(1)` statement directly outputs the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1**
