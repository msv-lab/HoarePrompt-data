Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is set to 1.
  - `n` is the first integer read from the input.
  - `k` is the second integer read from the input.
  - `num` is calculated as `2k - count_equal`.
  - `m` is calculated as `n - (2k - count_equal)`.
  - It is explicitly stated that `m` is equal to 1.
  - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1`, which means `dp` has a length of 2 (`dp = [None, None]` initially).
  - `dp[1]` is set to 1.
  - `dp[2]` is not yet calculated because `m` is 1, so the loop that updates `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` does not execute.

- **Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print(1)
  ```

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Based on the provided information and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **1**
