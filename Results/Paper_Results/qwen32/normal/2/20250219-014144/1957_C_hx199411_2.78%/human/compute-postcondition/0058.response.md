Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4, `i` is 0, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula, `c` and `r` are the integers read from the second input pair, and `c` is equal to `r` if `num` is 3, otherwise `c` is not equal to `r`.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is incremented by 2. Initially, `num` was 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` was 2. After the increment, `num` becomes 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
