The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` is initially set to 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 2. After executing the code, `num` will be 2 if it was initially 1, and `num` will be 3 if it was initially 2.

Therefore, the updated value of `num` will be either 2 or 3 depending on its initial value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer read from the input (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5); `k` is the second integer read from the input (1 ≤ k ≤ n); each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `k` must be at least 1; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input; if `c` equals `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 3; `i` is 3**
