The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5. Additionally, `m` must be at least 5 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - count_equal`, `m` must be at least 5, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with the first element being 1, the third element being 3, the fourth element being 3, all other elements initialized to 0, `i` is 5**
