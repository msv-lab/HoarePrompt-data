The code snippet `m = n - num` updates the value of `m` based on the current values of `n` and `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the first integer read from the input
- `k` is the second integer read from the input
- `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the pairs `(c, r)` read during the `k` iterations
- `i` is `k`
- `m` is `n - num`
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula.

After executing `m = n - num`, the value of `m` is recalculated as `n - num`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the pairs `(c, r)` read during the `k` iterations, `i` is `k`, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, and `dp[2]` which is 3, and subsequent values computed using the loop formula.**
