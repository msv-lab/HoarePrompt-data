Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of different final configurations for each test case. The dynamic programming approach used in the code is incorrect for this problem.

Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `num`:**
   - The variable `num` is incremented by 1 if `c == r` and by 2 otherwise. This counts the number of positions that are either occupied or cannot be mirrored. However, this count is not directly useful for determining the number of valid configurations.

2. **Incorrect DP Transition:**
   - The DP transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is not appropriate for this problem. The problem involves placing rooks in a way that no two rooks attack each other, and the transitions need to account for the constraints of the chessboard and the mirroring rule.

3. **Handling of Mirroring:**
   - The problem specifies a specific mirroring rule that needs to be carefully handled. The current code does not properly account for the fact that certain positions cannot be mirrored and how this affects the placement of subsequent rooks.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks under the given constraints. Specifically, the problem can be reduced to counting the number of derangements (permutations where no element appears in its original position) for the positions that can be mirrored and handling the positions that cannot be mirrored separately.

Given the complexity of the problem, a correct solution would involve more sophisticated combinatorial techniques or possibly a different approach altogether. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
