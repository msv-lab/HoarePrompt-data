Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the size of a grid, and an integer `k` representing the number of moves made. It also receives `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the coordinates of each move within the grid. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given inputs.**
