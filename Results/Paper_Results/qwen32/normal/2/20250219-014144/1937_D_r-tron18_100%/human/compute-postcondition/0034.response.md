Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same. `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre` with the last element removed if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same. `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`. If `el` is '>', `ans[i]` is calculated as `- (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))` if `ol <= zr`, otherwise it is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is not '>', `ans[i]` is `2 * suffZero[-2] + i + 1 - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise it is `2 * suffZero[ol + 1] - suffZero[1] - 2 * preOne[-1]`. `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`. `ol` is equal to `totalOne` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `totalOne`. `zr` is 0 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`. `zeroInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr` when `el` is '>', otherwise it is `func_1(preOne, 0)` when `el` is '>'. `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr` when `el` is '>', otherwise it is `func_1(preOne, 0)` when `el` is '>'. `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'.**
