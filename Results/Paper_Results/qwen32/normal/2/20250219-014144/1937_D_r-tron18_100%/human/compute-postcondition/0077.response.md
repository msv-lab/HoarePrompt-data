Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet provided is:
```python
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
```

Given the initial state, we know:
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`.
- `zeroInd` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zeroInd` is `3`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.

The code modifies `ans[i]` based on the expression `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.

### Calculation of `ans[i]`:
- `zeroInd` is already defined based on the value of `el`.
- `oneInd` is calculated using `func_1(preOne, zr)`, but since the function `func_1` is not provided, we'll represent `oneInd` as `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- The constant `1` is added to the expression.

Thus, the new value of `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`.

### Output State:
The only variable that changes is `ans[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, 1]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`; `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'; `i` is `0`; `el` is `s1[0]`; `zeroInd` is `1` if `el` is '>', otherwise `zeroInd` is `3`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**.
