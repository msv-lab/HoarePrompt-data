The given code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `oneInd`. The value assigned is `2 * preOne[-1]`. This means `oneInd` is now twice the last element of the list `preOne`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list that now includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * suffZero[ol + 1] - suffZero[1]`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.**
