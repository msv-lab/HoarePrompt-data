### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify whether the implementation of `func_2` correctly simulates the behavior of the pinball game as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `pre`: A list of indices where the character is `'>'`.
   - `totalOne`: The count of `'>'` characters.
   - `preOne`: An accumulated list of indices where the character is `'>'`, starting with 0.
   - `suffZero`: A list initialized with 0, used to store cumulative sums of indices where the character is `'<'`.
   - `ans`: A list of zeros of length `n` to store the final answers.

2. **Processing Each Cell:**
   - The loop iterates over each cell from the end to the beginning (`for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`).
   - Depending on whether the character at the current index `i` is `'>'` or `'<'`, different calculations are performed to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

3. **Calculations for `'>'`:**
   - `ol`: Number of `'>'` characters remaining.
   - `zr`: Number of `'<'` characters encountered so far.
   - Depending on whether `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, different formulas are used to compute the time (`zeroInd` and `oneInd`) and update `ans[i]`.
   - Adjustments are made to `preOne` and `totalOne` after processing a `'>'`.

4. **Calculations for `'<'`:**
   - Update `suffZero` with the cumulative sum of indices where the character is `'<'`.
   - Similar to the `'>'` case, `ol` and `zr` are calculated, and different formulas are used to compute the time (`zeroInd` and `oneInd`) and update `ans[i]`.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the computed times for each cell are printed.

### Verification Against Problem Statement:

- **Movement Rules:** The program correctly simulates the movement of the pinball based on the direction specified by the character in the grid cell. The character is inverted after the pinball moves, but since the program calculates the time for each cell independently, it doesn't need to explicitly invert the characters.
- **Boundary Conditions:** The program handles boundary conditions correctly by checking whether the pinball leaves the grid from the left or right side.
- **Efficiency:** The use of accumulation and prefix/suffix sums allows the program to efficiently compute the required times without simulating each pinball movement step-by-step, which would be computationally expensive given the constraints.

Given the above analysis, the implementation appears to correctly simulate the pinball game and compute the required times for each cell. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
