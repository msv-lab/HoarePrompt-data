The code snippet initializes a list `ans` with `n` zeros. This operation does not affect the values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, or `suffZero`. The only change is the introduction of the new list `ans`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.**
