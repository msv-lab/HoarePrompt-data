To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
```

Here, `oneInd` is being calculated based on the last element of `preOne` and the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`. 

- `preOne[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `preOne`.
- `func_1(preOne, 1)` is a function call, but since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot compute its exact value. However, we can express `oneInd` in terms of `preOne[-1]` and the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `oneInd`. All other variables retain their original values unless they are directly affected by the code snippet, which they are not in this case.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is 0, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1` which is '>', `ol` is 0, `zr` is 0, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.
