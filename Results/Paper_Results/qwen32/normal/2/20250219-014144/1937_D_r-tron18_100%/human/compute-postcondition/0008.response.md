Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`. The current value of `el` is '>'. `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0.**

Explanation: The variables `ol` and `zr` have been updated. `ol` is set to the value of `totalOne`, and `zr` is set to `len(suffZero) - 1`, which is `0` since `suffZero` is `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
