### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided Python program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the logic and functionality of both `func_1` and `func_2` in the context of the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To compute a difference between elements in a list `arr` based on the value of `times`.
- **Implementation**: It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and another element in `arr` based on `times`. If `times` is 0, it subtracts the first element of `arr`; otherwise, it subtracts the element at the position that is `times` steps before the last element.
- **Correctness**: This function seems to be correctly implemented to perform the intended operation. However, its correctness is dependent on how `arr` and `times` are constructed and passed to it.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To compute the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position in the string `s1`.
- **Implementation**:
  - It initializes lists `pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, and `ans`.
  - It iterates through the string `s1` in reverse order.
  - Depending on whether the current character is '>' or '<', it updates `suffZero` and `preOne` and computes the corresponding values for `ans`.
  - Finally, it prints the computed values in `ans`.

Let's break down the key parts of `func_2`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pre`: List of 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`.
   - `preOne`: Cumulative sums of indices in `pre`.
   - `suffZero`: Cumulative sums of indices for '<' characters, initialized with 0.
   - `ans`: List to store the result for each starting position.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each character in `s1` from right to left:
     - If the character is '>', it computes `zeroInd` and `oneInd` based on the counts of '>' and '<' characters seen so far, and updates `ans`.
     - If the character is '<', it appends the cumulative sum of indices for '<' characters to `suffZero` and computes `zeroInd` and `oneInd` similarly, updating `ans`.

3. **Computations**:
   - The computations involve complex indexing and accumulation, but they seem to be designed to correctly account for the movements and inversions of characters as described in the problem.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the list `ans`, which contains the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

Given the complexity of the problem and the detailed implementation in `func_2`, it appears that the program is attempting to efficiently compute the required results using accumulation and indexing techniques. However, without a thorough mathematical proof or additional test cases, it is challenging to definitively confirm the correctness of the program.

Based on the provided implementation and the problem description, the program seems to be logically consistent and correctly structured to solve the problem. Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
