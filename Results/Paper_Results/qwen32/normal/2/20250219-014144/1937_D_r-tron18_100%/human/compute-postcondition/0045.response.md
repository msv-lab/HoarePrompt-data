Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a positive integer; `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre` with the last element removed if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `2 * suffZero[-1] - (func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)) + n + 1 - (func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)); `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation: The value of `ans[i]` has been updated to `2 * suffZero[-1] - (func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)) + n + 1 - (func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr))`. All other variables retain their previous values.
