The code snippet assigns the value `2 * suffZero[-1]` to the variable `zeroInd`. Given that `suffZero` is initially `[0]`, `suffZero[-1]` refers to the last element of `suffZero`, which is `0`. Therefore, `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * 0`, which is `0`.

No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`. The current value of `el` is '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, and `ol` is greater than `zr`; `zeroInd` is 0.**
