To determine the output state, we need to focus on the given code snippet and its impact on the existing variables.

Given Code Snippet:
```python
oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
```

This line calculates the value of `oneInd` by calling the function `func_1` with arguments `preOne` and `zr`, and then multiplying the result by 2.

Let's break down the variables involved:
- `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`.
- `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we cannot compute its exact return value. However, we can express `oneInd` in terms of the function call.

### Impact on Variables:
- `oneInd` is newly calculated and assigned a value based on the function call `func_1(preOne, zr)` multiplied by 2.

### Unchanged Variables:
- `s1` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `pre` remains a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` remains the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` remains a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`.
- `suffZero` remains a list that now includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.
- `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros.
- `el` remains the character at index `i` of `s1`, and `el` is not equal to '>'.
- `ol` remains equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` remains equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` remains `2 * suffZero[-2] + i + 1`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list that now includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`, and `el` is not equal to '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-2] + i + 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**.
