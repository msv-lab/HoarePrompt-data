You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and computes a list of integers based on the positions of these characters. It then prints this list.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a grid of length `n` with each cell containing either `<` or `>`.
- A pinball placed on the `i-th` cell moves according to the direction indicated by `s_i`.
- After moving, the character `s_i` is inverted.
- The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
- For each cell `i`, we need to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a breakdown of what each function does:

1. **func_1(arr, times)**:
   - This function seems to compute a value based on accumulated sums and indices. It returns a computed value based on the last element of `arr` and a calculated index derived from `times`.

2. **func_2(s1, n)**:
   - This function processes the string `s1` of length `n` to determine the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid from each position.
   - It initializes several lists (`pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`) to keep track of positions and accumulated sums.
   - It iterates through the string `s1` in reverse order, updating these lists and computing the time for each position using `func_1`.

### Potential Issues:
- The logic inside `func_2` seems complex and involves intricate calculations with accumulated sums and indices.
- The problem description suggests a more straightforward simulation approach where we simulate the movement of the pinball for each starting position.
- The provided code does not explicitly simulate the pinball movement; instead, it relies on precomputed values and accumulated sums, which might not accurately reflect the pinball's behavior for all possible grid configurations.

### Testing with Examples:
Let's test the provided code with the example given in the problem statement:

**Input:**
```
3
3
>><
4
<<<<
6
<><<<>
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 6 5 
1 2 3 4 
1 4 7 10 8 1 
```

Running the provided code with this input yields the expected output. However, this alone does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs.

### Edge Cases:
Let's consider some edge cases:

1. **All '<' Characters:**
   - Input: `n=3, s1="<<<"`
   - Expected Output: `1 2 3`
   - The pinball will move left and leave the grid immediately.

2. **All '>' Characters:**
   - Input: `n=3, s1=">>>"`
   - Expected Output: `1 2 3`
   - The pinball will move right and leave the grid immediately.

3. **Alternating '<' and '>':**
   - Input: `n=4, s1="<><>"`
   - Expected Output: `1 4 3 6`
   - The pinball will alternate directions, and the time taken will depend on the specific sequence of movements.

### Conclusion:
While the provided code works for the given example, it does not seem to simulate the pinball movement directly. Instead, it uses a more mathematical approach involving accumulated sums and indices, which might not handle all edge cases correctly.

Given the complexity and the lack of explicit simulation, it is challenging to confirm the correctness of the code without further analysis or testing against a wide range of inputs.

**Correctness: False**

Explanation: The provided code does not explicitly simulate the pinball movement for each starting position, which might lead to incorrect results for certain grid configurations. While it works for the given example, it does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs.
