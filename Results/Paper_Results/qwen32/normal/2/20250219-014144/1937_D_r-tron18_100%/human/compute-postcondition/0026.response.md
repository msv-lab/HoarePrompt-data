The given code snippet calculates the value of `zeroInd` by summing the last two elements of the `suffZero` list. This operation does not affect any other variables except `zeroInd`.

Given the initial state, `suffZero` is a list that includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. Let's denote the last element of `suffZero` before the new element was added as `suffZero[-2]`, and the newly added element as `suffZero[-1]`. Therefore, `suffZero[-1]` is equal to `suffZero[-2] + i + 1`.

The calculation for `zeroInd` is:
\[ \text{zeroInd} = \text{suffZero}[-1] + \text{suffZero}[-2] \]
Substituting the value of `suffZero[-1]`:
\[ \text{zeroInd} = (\text{suffZero}[-2] + i + 1) + \text{suffZero}[-2] \]
\[ \text{zeroInd} = 2 \times \text{suffZero}[-2] + i + 1 \]

Thus, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * suffZero[-2] + i + 1`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list that now includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`. Additionally, `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`; `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-2] + i + 1`.**
