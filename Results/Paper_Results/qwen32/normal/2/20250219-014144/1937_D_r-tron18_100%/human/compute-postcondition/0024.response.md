The code snippet assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. No other variables are modified.

Given the initial state, `totalOne` represents the number of '>' characters in `s1`, and `suffZero` is a list that has just had an additional element appended to it. Therefore, `len(suffZero) - 1` gives the index of the newly added element in `suffZero`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list that now includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**
