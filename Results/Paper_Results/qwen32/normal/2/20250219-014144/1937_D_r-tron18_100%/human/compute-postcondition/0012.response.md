Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's determine the new output state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is 0.
- `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`.
- `suffZero` is `[0]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1` which is '>'.
- `ol` is 0.
- `zr` is 0.
- `zeroInd` is 0.
- `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

### Code Execution:
The line of code provided is:
```python
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
```

This line updates the `i`-th element of the `ans` list with the value of `zeroInd - oneInd`.

### Output State Calculation:
- `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`. Since `zeroInd` is 0 and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, the new value of `ans[i]` is `- (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is 0, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `- (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1` which is '>', `ol` is 0, `zr` is 0, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.
