To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **String `s1`**: It is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
2. **List `pre`**: This list contains the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`.
3. **Variable `totalOne`**: Initialized to 0. It seems to keep track of the total number of '>' characters.
4. **List `preOne`**: Initialized to `[0]`. It likely keeps track of cumulative counts of '>' characters up to each position in `s1`.
5. **List `suffZero`**: A list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including cumulative sums of indices for '<' characters.
6. **List `ans`**: A list of `n` integers where each element is determined based on specific conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`.

Given the complexity of the conditions for determining the values in `ans`, and without the exact code that populates `ans`, we can only describe the nature of the output based on the information provided.

### Explanation of Variables:
- **`s1`**: A string of '<' and '>', e.g., "<<<>>>".
- **`pre`**: Indices of '>' characters in `s1`, e.g., if `s1 = "<<<>>>"`, then `pre = [4, 5, 6]`.
- **`totalOne`**: Total count of '>' characters in `s1`.
- **`preOne`**: Cumulative count of '>' characters up to each position in `s1`.
- **`suffZero`**: Cumulative sum of indices for '<' characters.
- **`ans`**: List of `n` integers derived from certain conditions.

### Determining `ans`:
The list `ans` is populated based on conditions involving indices of '<' and '>' characters, cumulative counts, and other derived values (`ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `fi`). Without the exact logic to populate `ans`, we can only say that `ans` is a list of `n` integers.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans`, which are `n` integers derived from the conditions specified in the problem.

Output: **[a1, a2, ..., an] (where ai are the integers in the ans list determined by the given conditions)**
