Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `n` is a positive integer. `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`. `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`: if `el` is '>', it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2; otherwise, it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1. `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'. `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and the conditions involving `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi`. If `el` is '>', `ans[i]` is calculated differently depending on whether `ol <= zr` or not. If `el` is not '>', `ans[i]` is calculated based on whether `zr <= ol` or not. `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`. `ol` is equal to `totalOne`. `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>'. `i` is `i_end - 1`.**
