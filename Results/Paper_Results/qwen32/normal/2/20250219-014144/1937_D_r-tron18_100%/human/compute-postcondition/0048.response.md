The given code snippet only modifies the value of `totalOne` by decrementing it by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Since `totalOne` was initially defined as "the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same," after executing `totalOne -= 1`, `totalOne` will be "the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2 if `el` is '>', otherwise it will be the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1."

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer, `pre` is a list of integers representing the 1-based indices of '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 2 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting with 0 and including the cumulative sums of `pre` with the last element removed if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same, but now with the last element popped out, `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes an additional element equal to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined as follows: if `ol <= zr`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `2 * suffZero[-1] - (func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)) + n + 1 - (func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr))`, `el` is the character at index `i` of `s1`, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `fi` is `pre[0]` if `ol > zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is `i_end - 1`.**
