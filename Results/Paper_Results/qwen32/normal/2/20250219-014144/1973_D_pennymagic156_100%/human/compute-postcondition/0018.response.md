The code assigns the value of `i` to `v`. Given that `i` is initially set to `n - 2`, the new value of `v` will be `n - 2`. The values of `n`, `k`, and the precondition that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `i` is \(n - 2\); `v` is \(n - 2\).**
