To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `cnt` is non-zero and specifically described as `initial cnt - 1`. However, `cnt` is not directly used in the print statement.
- `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`. Since `func_2()` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its exact value but know it contributes to the value of `l`.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` must be greater than `func_2()`. Again, since `func_2()` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Let's analyze the components:
- The first part of the string is a literal question mark (`?`).
- The second part is the value of `l`, which is `func_2() + 1`.
- The third part is the product of `i` and `v`. Given that `i` is 1, this simplifies to just the value of `v`.

Since `func_2()` and `v` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact numerical values. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? [func_2() + 1] [v] (where func_2() is a function whose value contributes to l, and v is a variable)**
