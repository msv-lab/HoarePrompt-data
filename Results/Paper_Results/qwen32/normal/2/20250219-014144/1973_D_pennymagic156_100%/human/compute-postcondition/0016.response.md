Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- **Variables and their definitions:**
  - `n` and `k` are returned by `func_3()` and are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
  - `i` is defined as \(n - 2\).
  - `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`. However, `v` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this particular task.

- **Print Statement Analysis:**
  - The print statement is `print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)`.
  - Here, `i * n` is being calculated where `i = n - 2`.

Given these definitions, let's determine the output:

1. **Calculate `i`:**
   - Since `i = n - 2`, if `n` is any integer between 1 and \(10^4\), then `i` will be `n - 2`.

2. **Calculate `i * n`:**
   - This will be `(n - 2) * n`.

3. **Formulate the Output:**
   - The print statement will output `? 1` followed by the value of `(n - 2) * n`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, we can only express the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **? 1 (n - 2) * n (where n is the value returned by func_3())**
