To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with the conditions `n >= k` and `n` being at least 0.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration.
- `cnt` is initialized to `k`.
- `l` is initialized to 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `l`:**
   - From the initial state, `l` is explicitly set to 1.
   
2. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly set to 1.

3. **Value of `v`:**
   - `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration. Since the exact value of `v` is not specified, we will represent it as `v`.

4. **Expression `i * v`:**
   - Given `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `1 * v`, which is just `v`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the string formatted with the values of `l` and `i * v`. Substituting the known values, we get:
- `l` is 1.
- `i * v` is `v`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 v (where v is the value returned by func_2() in the last iteration)**
