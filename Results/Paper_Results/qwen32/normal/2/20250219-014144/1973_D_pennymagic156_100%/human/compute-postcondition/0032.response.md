To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while cnt and l < n + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will continue as long as both `cnt` is non-zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that `n >= k` and `n` is at least 0.
- `k` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration.
- `cnt` is `k - 2`.
- `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` + 1.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is defined as `k - 2`. For `cnt` to be non-zero, `k` must be greater than 2 (since `k > 1` is already given).

2. **Condition `l < n + 1`:**
   - `l` is defined as the value returned by `func_2()` + 1. To satisfy `l < n + 1`, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

### Adjustments:
- Since `k` must be greater than 2 for `cnt` to be non-zero, we need to ensure `k` is at least 3.
- To ensure `l < n + 1`, we need to consider the current value of `l` and `n`. Since `l` is derived from `func_2() + 1`, we need to ensure that this value is less than `n + 1`.

### Conclusion:
- We need to ensure `k` is at least 3 to make `cnt` non-zero.
- We need to ensure `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given these conditions, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that `n >= k` and `n` is at least 0, `k` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` + 1 and `l` must be less than `n + 1`**
