To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the code:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is defined as \(n - 1\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is defined as \(n - 1\). Therefore, `i` is one less than the value of `n`.
2. **Expression `i * n`**: This expression multiplies `i` (which is \(n - 1\)) by `n`. So, `i * n` evaluates to \((n - 1) * n\).

### Substituting the Values:
- Since `i = n - 1`, the expression `i * n` becomes \((n - 1) * n\).
- The print statement formats this into a string with the prefix `? 1`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the string `? 1` followed by the value of \((n - 1) * n\).

### Conclusion:
Based on the given initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 (n - 1) * n (where n is the value returned by func_3())**
