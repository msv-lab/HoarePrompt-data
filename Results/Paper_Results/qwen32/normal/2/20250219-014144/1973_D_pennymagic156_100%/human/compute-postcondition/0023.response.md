The code assigns the value of `k` to `cnt` and the value `1` to `l`. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that `n >= k`, `i` is 1, and `v` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration; `cnt` is `k`; `l` is 1.**
