Output State: **`cnt` is at least 1 (originally greater than 1) minus 1, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `n` is greater than `l`.**

Natural Language: The value of `cnt` is decreased by 1, while the values of `l` and `n` remain unchanged. The condition that `cnt` is originally greater than 1 still holds true, as it is now at least 1. The relationship between `l` and `n` also remains valid.
