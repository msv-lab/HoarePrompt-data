To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Initial State:
- `cnt` is 0
- `l` is the value returned by `func_2()` in the last iteration + 1
- `l` equals `n + 1`

Code Snippet:
```python
func_2()
```

Impact:
- The function `func_2()` is called, but there is no information about what `func_2()` does or returns.
- Since `func_2()` is called, it may modify the global state or return a value, but without additional information, we assume it doesn't affect `cnt` or `l` directly unless it modifies them within its body.

Given the lack of details about `func_2()`, we can only conclude that `func_2()` is executed, but it doesn't change the values of `cnt` or `l` based on the provided information.

Therefore, the Output State remains:
Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`**.
