The given code snippet reassigns the variable `l` to the value of `func_2() + 1`. Since `l` was initially set to `func_2() + 1`, this reassignment does not change its value. Therefore, the value of `l` remains the same. The other variables (`cnt`, `i`, and `n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`cnt` is non-zero (specifically, `initial cnt - 1`), `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than `func_2()`**.
