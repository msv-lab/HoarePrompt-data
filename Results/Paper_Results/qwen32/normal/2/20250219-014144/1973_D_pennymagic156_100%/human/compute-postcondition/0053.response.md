To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `cnt` is at least 1 (originally greater than 1).
- `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`.
- `n` is greater than `l`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `l`:**
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`.
   - Since `func_2()` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `l`. However, we know that `l` is the result of `func_2()` plus one.

2. **Variable `i` and `v`:**
   - The variables `i` and `v` are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, their exact values are unknown.
   - The expression `i * v` represents the product of `i` and `v`.

### Output Description:
Given the lack of specific values for `func_2()`, `i`, and `v`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

- The `print` statement will output a string starting with `'?'`, followed by the value of `l`, and then the product of `i` and `v`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [l] [i * v] (where l is func_2() + 1, i is an undefined variable, and v is an undefined variable)**
