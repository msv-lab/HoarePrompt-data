To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variable `cnt`**: It is mentioned that `cnt` must be at least 1. However, it is not directly used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output of this specific print statement.

2. **Variable `l`**: It is defined as `func_2() + 1`. Since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact return value. Therefore, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

3. **Variable `n`**: It is stated that `n` must be greater than `l`. Again, since `l` depends on the undefined function `func_2()`, we cannot determine the exact value of `n` either.

4. **Variables `i` and `v`**: These variables are used in the expression `i * v` within the print statement. However, their values are not specified in the initial state. Thus, we do not know their exact values.

Given these uncertainties, the output of the print statement can only be described in terms of the variables themselves:

- `l` is `func_2() + 1`
- `i * v` is the product of `i` and `v`, but their values are unknown.

Therefore, the output will be formatted as follows:

Output: **? func_2() + 1 i * v (where l is func_2() + 1, i is the value of i, and v is the value of v)**
