To determine the output state, we need to consider the function call `func_2()` and its potential impact on the variables `i`, `cnt`, and `l`. Since the definition of `func_2()` is not provided, we cannot definitively state how these variables will be altered. However, we can assume that `func_2()` may modify one or more of these variables.

Let's assume that `func_2()` could potentially change the values of `i`, `cnt`, and `l`. Without knowing the exact implementation, we can only say that their values might change based on what `func_2()` does internally.

Given this assumption, the output state would reflect the changes made by `func_2()`. Since the exact changes are unknown, we will denote the new values of `i`, `cnt`, and `l` as `new_i`, `new_cnt`, and `new_l` respectively.

Output State: **`i` is `new_i`, `cnt` is `new_cnt`, `l` is `new_l`**

In natural language, this means that after calling `func_2()`, the values of `i`, `cnt`, and `l` have been updated to `new_i`, `new_cnt`, and `new_l` respectively, where these new values depend on the implementation of `func_2()`.
