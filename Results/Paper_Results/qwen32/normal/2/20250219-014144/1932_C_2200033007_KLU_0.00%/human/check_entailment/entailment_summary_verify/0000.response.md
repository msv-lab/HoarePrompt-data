### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Initial State:** We start with an array `a` of length `n`, an integer `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing commands 'L' and 'R'.
2. **Processing Commands:**
   - For each command, compute the remainder of the product of all elements in the current array `a` modulo `m`.
   - Output this remainder.
   - If the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from `a`.
   - If the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from `a`.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program does not correctly follow the steps outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation:**
   - The program constructs a list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the commands ('L' or 'R').
   - It then calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list.
   - This approach does not match the requirement to compute the product of the remaining elements of `a` at each step before removing an element.

2. **Order of Operations:**
   - The problem requires computing the product of the current state of the array `a` before removing an element based on the command.
   - The provided program first collects elements into `b` and then computes the product in reverse order, which is incorrect.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program may not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `m` is 1 (where the remainder should always be 0) or when the array has only one element.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Initialize the product of the entire array `a` modulo `m`.
2. For each command, output the current product modulo `m`.
3. Update the product by removing the appropriate element (leftmost or rightmost) and adjusting the product accordingly.

#### Function Summary Evaluation:
The function summary provided does not accurately describe the intended behavior of the function `func_1`. It mentions that the function constructs a list `b` by selecting elements based on commands and then calculates the cumulative product in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires.

#### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
