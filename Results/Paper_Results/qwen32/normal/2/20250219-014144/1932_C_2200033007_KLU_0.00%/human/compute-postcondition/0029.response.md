To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop iterates over the elements of the list `b` in reverse order.

Given the loop:
```python
for v in reversed(b):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variable `v` is the current element from the reversed list `b`.

### Analysis:
- **Variables in the loop head**: `v` and the list `b` (which is being iterated over in reverse).
- **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
  - `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4.
  - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
  - `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s` (and thus `b` is non-empty).
  - `l` is `n`.
  - `r` is `-1`.
  - `ans` is a list containing `p`.
  - `p` is `p * v`.

### Adjustments for the next iteration:
- Since the loop iterates over `b` in reverse, the next value of `v` should be the previous element in the reversed list `b`.
- The list `b` itself does not change; it remains the same throughout the loop iterations.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `v` will be the next element in the reversed list `b`. Since we don't know the exact elements of `b`, we can denote the new value of `v` as the next element in the sequence.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s` (and thus `b` is non-empty), `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing `p`, `p` is `p * v`, `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b`**.
