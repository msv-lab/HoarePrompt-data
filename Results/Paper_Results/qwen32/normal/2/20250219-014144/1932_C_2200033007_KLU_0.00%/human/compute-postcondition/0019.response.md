The given code snippet only modifies the variable `l` by incrementing it by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'
- `i` is `n`
- `b` contains the element `a[n-1]` appended to it

The variable `l` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it was defined somewhere before this code snippet and its value is unknown except that it is being incremented by 1.

After executing `l += 1`, the value of `l` is increased by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `i` is `n`, `b` contains the element `a[n-1]` appended to it, `l` is increased by 1.**
