The code snippet provided decrements the variable `r` by 1. This means the value of `r` is reduced by one unit from its initial value.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'
- `i` is `n`
- `b` has an additional element `a[r]` appended to it

After executing the line `r -= 1`, only the value of `r` changes. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `i` is `n`, `b` has an additional element `a[r]` appended to it, `r` is decreased by 1.**
