Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`. The current character at index `i` in `s` is 'L'.**

In simple terms, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, making `l` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
