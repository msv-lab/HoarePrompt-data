The code appends the element at index `r` of list `a` to list `b`. Given the initial state, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether `s[i]` is 'L' or 'R'. After the operation, `b` will have one additional element.

Let's break down the changes:
- If `s[i]` is 'L', initially `b` contains the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`). After appending `a[r]` (which is `a[n - 1]`), `b` will contain `[a[0], a[n - 1]]`.
- If `s[i]` is 'R', initially `b` contains the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n - 1]`). After appending `a[r]` (which is `a[n - 2]`), `b` will contain `[a[n - 1], a[n - 2]]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `l`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list containing `[a[0], a[n - 1]]`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `b` is a list containing `[a[n - 1], a[n - 2]]`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2`, `i` is `n-1`.**
