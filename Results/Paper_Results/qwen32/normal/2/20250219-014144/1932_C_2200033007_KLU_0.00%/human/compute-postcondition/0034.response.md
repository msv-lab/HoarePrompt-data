The given code snippet appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `l`, `r`, `p`, or `v`. The only change is that `ans` now contains one additional element, which is the current value of `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing `p`, `p * v * v`, and the current value of `p`, `p` is `p * v`, `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b` after the current `v`.**
