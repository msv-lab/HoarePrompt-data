The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer, though not used in the function), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the direction specified by `s`. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list.
