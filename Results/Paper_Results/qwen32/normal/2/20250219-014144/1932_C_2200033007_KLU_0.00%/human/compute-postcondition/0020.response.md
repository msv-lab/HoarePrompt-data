The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` appends the element at index `r` of list `a` to list `b`. Given the initial state, we know that `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `r` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, which means we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can infer that `r` should be a valid index within the bounds of `a` (i.e., `0 ≤ r < n`). Since `r` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact value being appended to `b`.

Given the initial state and the operation performed, the only change is that list `b` will have one additional element, which is `a[r]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `i` is `n`, `b` has an additional element `a[r]` appended to it.**
