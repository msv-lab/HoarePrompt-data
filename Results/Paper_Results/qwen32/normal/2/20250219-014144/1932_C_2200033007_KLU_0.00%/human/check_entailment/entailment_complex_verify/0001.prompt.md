You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` in its original order, which contains the cumulative products of elements in `b` from the last element to the first.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (the length of list `a` and string `s`), `m` (an integer, though not used in the function), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the direction specified by `s`. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array), `m` (modulus), the array `a` of `n` integers, and the string `s` of `n` commands.

2. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process the commands and compute the required remainders.
   - Inside `func_1`, two pointers `l` and `r` are initialized to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a` respectively.
   - A list `b` is used to store the elements that are removed according to the commands in `s`.

3. **Storing Removed Elements:**
   - For each command in `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', the leftmost element `a[l]` is appended to `b`, and `l` is incremented.
     - If the command is 'R', the rightmost element `a[r]` is appended to `b`, and `r` is decremented.
   - This part seems correct as it correctly identifies which element to remove based on the command.

4. **Calculating Remainders:**
   - After storing the removed elements in `b`, the program calculates the product of these elements in reverse order and computes the remainder when divided by `m`.
   - It initializes a variable `p` to 1 and iterates over the reversed list `b`.
   - For each element `v` in `reversed(b)`, it multiplies `p` by `v` and appends the result modulo `m` to the list `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed list `ans`.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Calculation of Product:**
  - The program calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, but it should calculate the product of the remaining elements in `a` before each removal.
  - The current implementation does not reflect the product of the remaining elements in `a` before each command is processed.

- **Modulo Operation Timing:**
  - The modulo operation should be applied during the product calculation to prevent overflow and ensure efficiency.
  - The current implementation applies the modulo operation only after the product is fully calculated, which can lead to incorrect results due to overflow.

### Correct Approach

To fix the program, we need to:
- Calculate the product of the current elements in `a` before each removal.
- Apply the modulo operation during the product calculation.
- Remove the appropriate element based on the command.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the current program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
