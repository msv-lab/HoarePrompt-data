You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Example

Input

    4
    
    4 6
    
    3 1 4 2
    
    LRRL
    
    5 1
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    LLLLL
    
    6 8
    
    1 2 3 4 5 6
    
    RLLLRR
    
    1 10000
    
    10000
    
    R

Output

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4 
    0 
    
Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.
Program:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
