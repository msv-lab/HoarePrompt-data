The only object in the loop head is the variable `v`, which iterates over the reversed list `b`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `v` for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was the next element in the reversed list `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `v` should be the next element in the sequence when iterating over the reversed list `b`.

Given that `v` is the current element from the reversed list `b`, in the next iteration, `v` will take the value of the previous element in the reversed list `b`.

Let's denote the current state of `v` as `v_current`. In the next iteration, `v` will be the element before `v_current` in the reversed list `b`.

Since we don't have the exact values of `b` or the position of `v_current` within `b`, we can only describe the state in terms of the next expected value of `v` from the reversed list `b`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing `p` and `p * v * v`, `p` is `p * v * v`, `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b`**.

However, to be more precise about the change in `v`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`, `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing `p` and `p * v * v`, `p` is `p * v * v`, `v` is the next element in the reversed list `b` after the current `v`**.

This means `v` is updated to the previous element in the reversed list `b`.
