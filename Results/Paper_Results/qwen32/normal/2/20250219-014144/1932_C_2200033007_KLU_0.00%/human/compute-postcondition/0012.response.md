The code appends the element at index `l` from the list `a` to the list `b`. Given the initial conditions, `l` is either 0 or `n-1` depending on whether `s[i]` is 'L' or 'R'. Since `i` is `n-1`, `s[i]` refers to the last character of the string `s`.

If `s[n-1]` is 'L':
- `b` initially contains the first element of `a`.
- `l` is 1.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- After appending `a[l]` to `b`, `b` now contains the first element of `a` followed by the second element of `a`.

If `s[n-1]` is 'R':
- `b` initially contains the last element of `a`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 2`.
- After appending `a[l]` to `b`, `b` now contains the last element of `a` followed by the first element of `a`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `l`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `i` is `n-1`, `l` is 1 if `s[n-1]` is 'L' otherwise `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` if `s[n-1]` is 'L' otherwise `r` is `n - 2`, `b` is a list containing the first element of `a` followed by the second element of `a` if `s[n-1]` is 'L' otherwise `b` is a list containing the last element of `a` followed by the first element of `a`.**
