### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the list `a` of `n` integers, and the string `s` of `n` commands.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process the commands and compute the required remainders.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`.
   - It uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of `a` respectively.
   - For each command in `s`, it appends the appropriate element (`a[l]` for 'L' or `a[r]` for 'R') to `b` and updates the pointer.
   - After constructing `b`, it computes the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order and stores these products in `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the list `ans` in its original order.

3. **Issue in the Code:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly constructs the list `b` based on the commands in `s`.
   - However, it computes the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order and returns this list without taking the modulo `m` at each step.
   - According to the problem statement, the output should be the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` at each step, not just the cumulative product.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Instead of computing the cumulative product of elements in `b` in reverse order, the function should compute the product of all elements in `a` initially and then update this product based on the commands in `s`, taking the modulo `m` at each step.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality as per the problem statement. Specifically, it does not take the modulo `m` at each step when computing the product of the elements of the array.

**Correctness: False**
