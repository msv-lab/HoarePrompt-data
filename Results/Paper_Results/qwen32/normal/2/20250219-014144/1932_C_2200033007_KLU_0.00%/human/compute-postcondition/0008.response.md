The code appends the element at index `r` of list `a` to list `b`. Given that `r` is initialized to `n - 1`, the last element of list `a` is appended to list `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list containing the last element of `a`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`. Additionally, `s[i]` is not 'L'.**
