### Reasoning:

The provided program is supposed to process a series of commands ('L' or 'R') on an array `a` and output the remainder of the product of the array elements modulo `m` before each command is executed. The commands specify whether to remove the leftmost ('L') or rightmost ('R') element of the array.

However, there are several issues with the current implementation of `func_1`:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**: The code is appending individual elements of `a` into `b` based on the commands but is not calculating the product of the entire array `a` before each command. Instead, it calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires.

2. **Modulo Operation**: The problem explicitly asks for the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` modulo `m` before each command is executed. The current implementation does not perform this operation.

3. **Reversing the Result**: The function returns the result in reverse order, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    product = 1
    for num in a:
        product = (product * num) % m
    
    ans = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        ans.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * pow(a[l], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the leftmost element
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * pow(a[r], m-2, m)) % m  # Remove the rightmost element
            r -= 1
    
    return ans
```

In this corrected version:
- We calculate the initial product of all elements in `a` modulo `m`.
- For each command, we append the current product to the answer list.
- We then adjust the product by removing the appropriate element using modular multiplicative inverse (`pow(a[l], m-2, m)`), which effectively divides the product by `a[l]` or `a[r]` under modulo `m`.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the provided code, the current implementation is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
