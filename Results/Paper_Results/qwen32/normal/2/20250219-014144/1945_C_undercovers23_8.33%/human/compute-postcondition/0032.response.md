Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\); `n` is at least 2; `s` is the string provided by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `lst` is a list containing its previous elements plus `i + 1`; `mini` is \(10^8\); `i` is 1; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `z` is the count of '0's in `sl` incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `o` is the count of '1's in `sl` incremented by 1; `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.**

Explanation: The only change is that `lst` now includes the element `i + 1`, which is `2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
