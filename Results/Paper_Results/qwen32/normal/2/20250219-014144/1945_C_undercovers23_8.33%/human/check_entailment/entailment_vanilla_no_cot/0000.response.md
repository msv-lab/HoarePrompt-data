Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Percentages**: The code calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` as percentages multiplied by 100, which is unnecessary and incorrect for the given problem. The problem requires checking if the number of zeros is at least `ceil(i / 2)` and the number of ones is at least `ceil((n - i) / 2)`, not percentages.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not correctly handle the edge cases where the road might be placed before the first house (position 0) or after the last house (position n). Specifically, the check for these cases is flawed.

3. **Optimization for Minimum Distance**: The code calculates the minimum distance from the middle (`pk`) but does not correctly handle the case when no valid position is found in the loop. It incorrectly assumes that if no valid position is found, the road must be placed at either end, which is not necessarily true.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        mini = float('inf')
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                lst.append(i)
        if not lst:
            # Check if placing the road before the first house or after the last house works
            if z >= math.ceil(n / 2):
                lst.append(-1)  # Represents position 0
            if o >= math.ceil(n / 2):
                lst.append(n)   # Represents position n
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(n // 2 - ele))
        final = [ele for ele in lst if abs(n // 2 - ele) == mini]
        final.sort()
        print(final[0] + 1 if final[0] != -1 else 0)

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks the conditions for placing the road and handles the edge cases correctly.
