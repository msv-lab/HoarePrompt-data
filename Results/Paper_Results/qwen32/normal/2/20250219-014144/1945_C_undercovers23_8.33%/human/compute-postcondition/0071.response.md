Let's break down the given initial state and determine what will be printed by the `print(final[0])` statement.

### Initial State Analysis:

1. **`mini`**: This variable holds the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. However, this value is not directly relevant to the `print(final[0])` statement.

2. **`final`**: This list is determined based on the length of `final` and the value of `c1`.

   - If `len(final) == 0`, then:
     - If `c1 >= 50`, `final` becomes `[0]`.
     - Otherwise, `final` becomes `[n]`, where `n` is a variable that is not explicitly defined in the given initial state but is implied to be used in the context.

3. **`c1`**: This variable is calculated as `o * 100 // n`, where `o` and `n` are not explicitly defined in the given initial state but are implied to be used in the context.

### Determining `final[0]`:

Given that `len(final) == 0` before the conditional logic, we need to determine the value of `c1` to decide the contents of `final`.

- If `c1 >= 50`, `final` will be `[0]`.
- If `c1 < 50`, `final` will be `[n]`.

However, since the exact values of `o` and `n` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `c1`. Therefore, we must consider both possibilities.

### Conclusion:

The `print(final[0])` statement will print either `0` or `n` depending on the value of `c1`.

- If `c1 >= 50`, `final[0]` will be `0`.
- If `c1 < 50`, `final[0]` will be `n`.

Since we do not have the specific values of `o` and `n`, we can only describe the output in terms of these conditions.

Output: **0 if c1 >= 50, otherwise n (where c1 is o * 100 // n and n is a variable used in the context)**
