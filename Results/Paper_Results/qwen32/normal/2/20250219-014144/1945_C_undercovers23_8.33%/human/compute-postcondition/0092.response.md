Postcondition: **`mini` is 100000000; `len(final) == 0`. After the if condition `(zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50)` is met, `final` remains a list containing the single element `0` if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` becomes a sorted list containing the single element `n`. `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer greater than 1; `s` is the user's input; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of `'1'` in `sl`; `z` is the count of `'0'` in `sl`; `zero` is 1 if `s[i]` is `'0'`, otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 1 if `s[i]` is not `'0'`, otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))` and is greater than or equal to 50; `one_perc` is also greater than or equal to 50.**
