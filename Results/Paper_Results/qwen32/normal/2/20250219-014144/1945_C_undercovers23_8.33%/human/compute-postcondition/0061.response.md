Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`. `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. All elements of `lst` have been processed.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `mini` remains the smallest difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. The `final` list contains all elements from `lst` that have this smallest difference with `pk`. The loop has gone through every element in `lst`.
