In the given task, the for loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`. The variables in the loop head are `elem` and `lst`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `lst` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **`lst`**: This list must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. If `lst` is empty, the loop will not run.
2. **`elem`**: This variable represents the current element being processed in the loop. Before the loop starts, `elem` does not need to be initialized because it will be assigned the first element of `lst` during the first iteration.

The state of `mini` and `final` is not directly related to the execution of the loop itself, but they are part of the initial state provided. Since the task specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, we should focus on `lst`.

Given this, the adjusted state should ensure that `lst` has at least one element.

State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is an empty list; `lst` must contain at least one element**.
