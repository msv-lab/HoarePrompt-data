The code appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. The values of `mini`, `lst`, and the condition that `abs(pk - elem) == mini` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `final` is a list containing `elem`; `lst` must contain at least one element; the current value of `elem` satisfies `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.**
