Output State: **`final` remains unchanged unless initially empty and `c1` met the condition; `t` is decremented by `n - 1`; `zero` and `one` reflect counts of '0's and '1's; `lst` contains indices where `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were both >= 50 and must have at least two elements; `mini` is the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`; `ele` is the second element in `lst`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `mini` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial descriptions.
