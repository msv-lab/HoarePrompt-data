The only variable in the loop head is `ele`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If there are more elements in `lst` to iterate over, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ele` took the value of the last element processed from `lst`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ele` needs to take the value of the next element in `lst`.

Since the problem does not specify the current position of `ele` in `lst` or the length of `lst`, we can assume that `ele` currently holds the value of the `k`-th element, and for the loop to continue, it should now hold the value of the `(k+1)`-th element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))`, `pk` is unchanged, `ele` is the next element in `lst`**
