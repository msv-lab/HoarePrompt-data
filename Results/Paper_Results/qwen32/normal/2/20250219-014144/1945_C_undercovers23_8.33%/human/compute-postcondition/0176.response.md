The given code snippet calculates `zero_perc` using the formula `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. The other variables (`final`, `t`, `i`, `zero`, `one`, `one_perc`, and the conditions for `lst`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified in subsequent code.

Given the initial state, the only variable affected by this line is `zero_perc`.

Output State: **`final` is a sorted list; `t` is decremented by 1; `i` is 4; if `s[i]` was '0', `zero` is incremented by either 1 or 2 depending on whether the if condition is true or false; `one` is incremented by 1 in the if part and by 2 in the else part; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))` in both parts. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` includes `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `zero_perc` is updated to `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. All other variables retain their initial states.
