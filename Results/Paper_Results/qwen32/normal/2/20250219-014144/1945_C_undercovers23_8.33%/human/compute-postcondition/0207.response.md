Postcondition: **`final` is a list containing either one element `[0]` if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, or the single element `n` if `c1` is less than 50. `t` has been decremented by `n - 1`; `zero` and `one` reflect counts of '0's and '1's; `lst` is unchanged; `mini` is unchanged; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.**
