Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the input integer between 1 and 100; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D"; `cases` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    cases.append((n, s))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer read from the input, `s` is the string read from the input consisting of only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the newly read integer from the input, `s` is the newly read string from the input consisting of only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first being `(n, s)` and the second also being `(n, s)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 99, `n` is the newly read integer from the input, `s` is the newly read string from the input consisting of only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing three tuples, the first two being `(n, previous_s)` and the third being `(n, s)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
