Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer read from the input, `s` is the string read from the input consisting of only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`**.

Explanation: The value of `t` remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `s` remain as they were read from the input. The `cases` list, which was initially empty, now contains one tuple `(n, s)`.
