The given code snippet reads a line from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `s`. This means that the value of `s` will be updated to whatever string is provided as input, which should still be a string of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D". The variables `t` and `cases` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer read from the input, `s` is the string read from the input consisting of only "U" and "D", `cases` is an empty list.**
