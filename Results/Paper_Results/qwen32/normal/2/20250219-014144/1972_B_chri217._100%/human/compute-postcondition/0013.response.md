Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 99, `n` is the newly read integer from the input, `s` is the newly read string from the input consisting of only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing three tuples, the first two being `(n, previous_s)` and the third being `(n, s)`**

Explanation: The `cases` list now contains three tuples instead of two. The first two tuples remain unchanged, and a new tuple `(n, s)` has been appended to the list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain as they were initially described.
