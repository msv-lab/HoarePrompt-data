To determine if the given program is correct, we need to carefully analyze its logic against the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
- Bob has `n` buns to sell.
- The usual price per bun is `a` coins.
- He can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` coins down to `(b - k + 1)` coins.
- The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins.
- We need to find the maximum profit Bob can achieve.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Choosing `k`:**
   ```python
   k = min(n, b - a)
   ```
   Here, the program calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `(b - a)`. This makes sense because:
   - If `b - a` is less than `n`, then Bob can only sell up to `b - a` buns at the decreasing price.
   - If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then Bob can sell all `n` buns at the decreasing price.

3. **Calculating Profit:**
   ```python
   if b <= a:
       print(a * n)
   else:
       print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
   ```
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - Otherwise, the profit calculation is split into two parts:
     - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at the decreasing price: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`
     - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price: `(n - k) * a`

### Verification:
Let's verify the logic with the example provided:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = min(4, 1) = 1`
   - Profit: `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 0 + 12 = 17`
   - Output: `17` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = min(5, 4) = 4`
   - Profit: `9 * 4 - 4 * (4 - 1) // 2 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`
   - Output: `35` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = min(10, -5) = 0`
   - Profit: `10 * 0 - 0 * (0 - 1) // 2 + (10 - 0) * 10 = 0 + 0 + 100 = 100`
   - Output: `100` (Correct)

All test cases match the expected output, confirming that the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
