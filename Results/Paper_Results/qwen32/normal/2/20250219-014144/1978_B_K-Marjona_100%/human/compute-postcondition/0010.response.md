Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `a` is the second integer read from the input, `b` is the third integer read from the input, `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to be the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`) retain their initial values.
