Let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `a` is the second integer read from the input.
- `b` is the third integer read from the input, and `b` is greater than `a`.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine `k`:**
   - `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
   - This means `k = min(n, b - a)`.

2. **Calculate `b * k`:**
   - This is simply `b` multiplied by `k`.

3. **Calculate `k * (k - 1) // 2`:**
   - This is the sum of the first `k-1` integers, which is a common formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - It represents the sum of the sequence: 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1).

4. **Calculate `(n - k) * a`:**
   - This is `a` multiplied by the difference between `n` and `k`.

5. **Combine the results:**
   - The expression `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` combines these calculations to produce the final result.

### Explanation of the Expression:
- `b * k` gives the total if all `k` items were `b`.
- `k * (k - 1) // 2` subtracts the sum of the first `k-1` integers, effectively reducing the total by the sum of the differences between `b` and the integers from `b-1` down to `b-(k-1)`.
- `(n - k) * a` adds the contribution of the remaining `n-k` items, each being `a`.

### Final Output:
Given the above steps, the output of the print statement can be described as follows:

Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum of n and b - a)**

This output precisely describes the value that will be printed based on the given initial state and the formula used in the code snippet.
