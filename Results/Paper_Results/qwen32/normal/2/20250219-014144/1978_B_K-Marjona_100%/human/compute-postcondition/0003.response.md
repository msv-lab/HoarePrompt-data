Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `a` is the second integer read from the input, `b` is the third integer read from the input, and `b` is less than or equal to `a`. Consequently, `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, which implies `k` is 0 since `b - a` is less than or equal to 0.**
