To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the expression step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

The expression inside the `print` statement is:
```python
b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
```

Here's what we know about the variables:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (though `t` is not used in the expression).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

Let's analyze the expression:
1. **`b * k`**: This term multiplies `b` by `k`.
2. **`k * (k - 1) // 2`**: This term calculates the sum of the first `k-1` integers. It is essentially the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is 1 and the last term is `k-1`.
3. **`(n - k) * a`**: This term multiplies the difference between `n` and `k` by `a`.

Putting it all together:
- `b * k` gives the product of `b` and `k`.
- Subtracting `k * (k - 1) // 2` adjusts this product by subtracting the sum of the first `k-1` integers.
- Adding `(n - k) * a` scales the difference between `n` and `k` by `a` and adds it to the previous result.

Given these components, the final output of the print statement can be described as follows:

Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum of n and b - a)**

This output represents the computed value of the expression based on the given variables and their relationships.
