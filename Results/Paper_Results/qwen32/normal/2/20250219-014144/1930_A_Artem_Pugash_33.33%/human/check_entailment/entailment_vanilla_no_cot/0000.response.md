Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers in non-decreasing order.
4. It then repeatedly picks the smallest two numbers from the sorted list, adds the smaller of the two to the score, and removes both numbers from the list.
5. This process is repeated `n` times, and the final score is printed for each test case.

The strategy of sorting the numbers and always picking the smallest two ensures that we are maximizing the sum of the minimums, which aligns with the goal of achieving the maximum final score. Therefore, the program is correct.
