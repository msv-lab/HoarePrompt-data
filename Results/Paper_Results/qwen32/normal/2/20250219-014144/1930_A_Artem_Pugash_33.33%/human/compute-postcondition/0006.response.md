To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition specified in the loop head: `numbers != []`. This means that the loop will execute as long as the list `numbers` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `numCases` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is initialized by the loop
- `numInteger` is the integer value provided by the user input
- `numbers` is a sorted list of substrings from the user input in ascending order
- `suma` is 0

The only variable in the loop head is `numbers`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `numbers` must not be an empty list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `numbers` contains at least one element.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is initialized by the loop, `numInteger` is the integer value provided by the user input, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of substrings from the user input in ascending order, `suma` is 0**

This ensures that the condition `numbers != []` is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute at least once.
