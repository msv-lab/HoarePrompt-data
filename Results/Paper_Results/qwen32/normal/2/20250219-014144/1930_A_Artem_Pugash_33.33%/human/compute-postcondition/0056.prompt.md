Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `numInteger` is the integer value provided by the user input, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the numbers provided by the user input in ascending order, `suma` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while numbers != []:
    a = int(numbers.pop(0))
    b = int(numbers.pop(0))
    suma += min(a, b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `numInteger` is the integer value provided by the user input, `numbers` is a sorted list of strings representing the numbers provided by the user input in ascending order with the first two elements removed, `suma` is `min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was initially removed from `numbers`, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `numCases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `numInteger` is the integer value provided by the user input, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of strings with the first four elements removed, `suma` is `min(a, int(numbers[0])) + min(a, b)`, `a` is the integer value of the third smallest number in the original list, `b` is the integer value of the fourth smallest number in the original list.`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `numCases` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is incremented by 1; `numInteger` is the integer value provided by the user input; `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of strings without its two smallest elements; `suma` is `min(a, int(numbers[0])) + min(a, b) + a`; `a` is the smallest number in the original list; `b` is the second smallest number in the original list.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
