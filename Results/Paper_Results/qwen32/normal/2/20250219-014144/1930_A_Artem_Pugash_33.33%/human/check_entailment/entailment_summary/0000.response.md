### Reasoning:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which indicates that there are `2n` integers in the subsequent line.
   - It then reads the `2n` integers and stores them in a list called `numbers`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list of numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order (`reverse=False`). Sorting helps in pairing the smallest numbers together to maximize the sum of the minimums.

3. **Calculating the Sum:**
   - The program initializes a variable `suma` to zero. This variable will store the final score.
   - It then enters a loop where it repeatedly removes the first two elements from the sorted list (which are the smallest due to sorting), calculates their minimum, and adds this minimum to `suma`.
   - This process continues until all numbers have been paired and removed from the list.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all pairs for a test case, the program prints the value of `suma`, which represents the maximum score achievable for that test case.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program's correctness using the provided examples:

- **First Test Case:**
  - Input: `1`, `2 3`
  - Sorted List: `[2, 3]`
  - Pairs: `(2, 3)`
  - Minimums: `2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Input: `2`, `1 1 2 1`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
  - Pairs: `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`
  - Minimums: `1` and `1`
  - Output: `2`

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Input: `3`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Sorted List: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Pairs: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(1, 1)`
  - Minimums: `1`, `1`, and `1`
  - Output: `3`

The program's output matches the expected results for these test cases, confirming that the implementation is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum final score by always pairing the smallest available numbers together, ensuring that the sum of the minimums is maximized.

**Correctness: True**
