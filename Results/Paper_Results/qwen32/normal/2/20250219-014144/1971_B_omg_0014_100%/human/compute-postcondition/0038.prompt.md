Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters; n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, then `a` contains only one unique character. If the length of `a` is not equal to 1, then `b` is the string `s` with its characters sorted, `c` is the string `s` with its characters sorted in descending order, and if `b` is equal to `s`, then `s` is already sorted in ascending order; otherwise, `s` is not sorted in ascending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new `s`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the length of `a` is 1, then `a` contains only one unique character. If the length of `a` is not equal to 1, `b` is the string `s` sorted in ascending order, and `c` is the string `s` sorted in descending order. If `b` is equal to the original `s`, then the original `s` is already sorted in ascending order; otherwise, the original `s` is not sorted in ascending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new `s`, and `i` is 4. If `a` contains exactly one unique character, the program does nothing additional. Otherwise, `b` is the sorted version of `s`, and `c` is the sorted version of `s` in reverse order. If `b` equals `s`, the condition is true; otherwise, the condition is false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
