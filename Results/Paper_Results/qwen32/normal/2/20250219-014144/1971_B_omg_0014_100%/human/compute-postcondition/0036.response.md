Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new `s`, `i` is 4, `b` is the sorted version of `s`, and `c` is the sorted version of `s` in reverse order. If `b` equals `s`, the condition is true; otherwise, the condition is false.**
