Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string provided by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, then `a` contains only one unique character. If the length of `a` is not equal to 1, then `b` is the string `s` with its characters sorted, `c` is the string `s` with its characters sorted in descending order, and if `b` is equal to `s`, then `s` is already sorted in ascending order; otherwise, `s` is not sorted in ascending order.**
