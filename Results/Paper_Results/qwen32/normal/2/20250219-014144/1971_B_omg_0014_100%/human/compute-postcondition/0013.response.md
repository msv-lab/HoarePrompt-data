To determine what will be printed by the `print(b)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variable `t`:** An integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. This variable does not directly affect the value of `b`.

2. **Variable `s`:** The input string provided by the user. The exact content of this string is not specified, but it is crucial for determining the value of `b`.

3. **Variable `n`:** Mentioned to be greater than 0, but it is not used in the context of defining `b`.

4. **Variable `a`:** A set containing unique characters from the string `s`. The length of `a` is not equal to 1, meaning the string `s` contains more than one unique character.

5. **Variable `b`:** The string `s` with its characters sorted in ascending order. Since `b` is not equal to `s`, it implies that the original string `s` was not already sorted.

Given these conditions, the value of `b` is the sorted version of the input string `s`. Therefore, the `print(b)` statement will output the sorted version of the input string `s`.

### Example Walkthrough:
If the input string `s` were "dcba", then:
- `a` would be the set `{'d', 'c', 'b', 'a'}` (which has a length of 4, not equal to 1).
- `b` would be the sorted version of "dcba", which is "abcd".

### Final Output:
Output: **b (where b is the string s with its characters sorted in ascending order)**

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot give a specific sorted string. However, we know that `b` will be the sorted version of whatever `s` is.

Output: **b (where b is the string s with its characters sorted in ascending order)**
