The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`data`, `t`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing the split input values, starting with the number of test cases `t` (where `t` must be greater than 0) followed by pairs of `n` and `s` for each test case; `index` is 2; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` (and `t` must be greater than 0); `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
