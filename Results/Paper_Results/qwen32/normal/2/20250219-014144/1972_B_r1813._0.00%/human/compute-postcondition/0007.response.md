The code snippet assigns the value of the second element in the `data` list (at index 1) to the variable `n` after converting it to an integer. This means `n` now holds the integer value of the second element in `data`. The values of `data`, `index`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing the split input values, starting with the number of test cases `t` (where `t` must be greater than 0) followed by pairs of `n` and `s` for each test case; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` (and `t` must be greater than 0); `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
