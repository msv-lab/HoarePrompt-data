You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of coins and a string indicating their orientations. It determines if the number of coins facing up is odd for each test case and prints 'YES' if it is, otherwise 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the winner of a game where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The key observation here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Game Dynamics**:
   - When a player removes a facing-up coin, the number of facing-up coins changes.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where the number of facing-up coins is even after his turn, and vice versa.
   - The player who faces a situation with an even number of facing-up coins will eventually be unable to make a move (since every move reduces the count of facing-up coins by an odd number, and starting from an even number will always lead to another even number until zero).

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - If the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always win because she can force Bob into a losing position.
   - If the initial number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always win because he can force Alice into a losing position.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The provided code reads the input, counts the number of 'U' characters (facing-up coins) in the string `s`, and checks if this count is odd or even.
   - If the count is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list (indicating Alice wins).
   - If the count is even, it appends 'NO' to the results list (indicating Bob wins).

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in the code correctly implements the above reasoning.
   - The code handles multiple test cases and outputs the correct result for each based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
