Output State: **`data` is a list containing the split input values, starting with the number of test cases `t` (where `t` must be greater than 0) followed by pairs of `n` and `s` for each test case; `index` is 3; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` (and `t` must be greater than 0); `results` is a list containing the string 'YES'; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `s` is the value of `data[2]`; `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s` and `num_up_coins` is odd.**

Explanation: The only change is that the string 'YES' has been appended to the `results` list. All other variables retain their initial values.
