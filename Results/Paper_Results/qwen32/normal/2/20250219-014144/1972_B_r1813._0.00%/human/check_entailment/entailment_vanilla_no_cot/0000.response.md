To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The game revolves around the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins ("U"). Here's why:

- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob.
- Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, any move Alice makes will leave an odd number of facing-up coins for Bob.
- Since the game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, the player who starts with an odd number of facing-up coins will always have the last move and thus win.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`. It then checks if this count is odd or even:
- If the count is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating Alice wins.
- If the count is even, it appends 'NO' to the results list, indicating Bob wins.

This logic aligns perfectly with the analysis above. Therefore, the program should correctly determine the winner for each test case based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, the program is correct.
