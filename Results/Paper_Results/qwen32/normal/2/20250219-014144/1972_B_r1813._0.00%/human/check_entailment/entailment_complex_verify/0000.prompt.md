You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `data` is a list containing the split input values, starting with the number of test cases `t` (which is now 0) followed by pairs of `n` and `s` for each test case; `index` is `2 * t + 1`; `t` is 0; `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` or `'NO'` depending on whether `num_up_coins` is odd or even for each test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: All elements in `results` have been printed. `data` is a list containing the split input values, starting with the number of test cases `t` (which is 1) followed by pairs of `n` and `s` for each test case; `index` is `2 * t + 1` (which is 3); `t` is 1; `results` is a list containing all the results for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of coins and a string indicating their orientations. It determines if the number of coins facing up is odd for each test case and prints 'YES' if it is, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Game Setup**: Coins form a circle, each either facing up ("U") or down ("D").
- **Players**: Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice going first.
- **Move**: A player picks a facing-up coin, removes it, and flips the adjacent coins.
- **Winning Condition**: The player who forces the opponent into a position with no facing-up coins wins.
- **Objective**: Determine if Alice will win given the initial configuration of coins, assuming optimal play from both players.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases, counts the number of "U" (facing-up) coins in each test case, and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even.

#### Key Logic:
- If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice wins (`'YES'`).
- If the number of "U" coins is even, Bob wins (`'NO'`).

### Correctness Verification:
The strategy hinges on the observation that:
- If the number of "U" coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position with an even number of "U" coins after her turn.
- Conversely, if the number of "U" coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a position with an odd number of "U" coins after his turn.

This is because:
- Each move reduces the number of "U" coins by exactly one.
- Flipping adjacent coins does not change the parity (odd/even nature) of the count of "U" coins.

Thus, the parity of the number of "U" coins determines who will eventually be forced into a losing position.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic based on the described strategy. It handles all possible configurations of coins and correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of "U" coins.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, which is the optimal strategy for this game.
