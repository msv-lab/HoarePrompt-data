The given code snippet initializes an empty list called `results`. This action does not affect the values of `data`, `index`, or `t`. The `results` list is simply prepared to store future results from the test cases.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing the split input values, starting with the number of test cases `t` followed by pairs of `n` and `s` for each test case; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `results` is an empty list.**
