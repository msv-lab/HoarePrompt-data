The code snippet assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to the variable `s`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation, except for the precondition that `n` must be greater than `i`, which remains valid. The value of `i` was initially stated as `i + 1`, which means `i` has already been incremented before this line of code is executed.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is `min(m, k)`**.
