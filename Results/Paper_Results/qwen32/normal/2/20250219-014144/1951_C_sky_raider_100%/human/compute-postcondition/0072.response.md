To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration and across multiple test cases.

### Key Variables:
- **t**: Accumulated sum of `s` values across all iterations within a single test case.
- **c**: Cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration within a single test case.
- **k**: Remaining `k` after all iterations within a single test case.
- **i**: Index variable used to iterate through the list `l`.
- **n, m, k**: Input parameters for each test case.
- **l**: Sorted list of integers for each test case.
- **s**: Minimum of `m` and `k` in each iteration.

### Loop Execution:
For each test case, the loop iterates `n` times, updating `t`, `c`, and `k` based on the current value of `s`. After all iterations for a test case, the result `c` is printed.

### Final Output State:
After all test cases have been processed, the variables will reflect the final state of the last test case processed. Specifically:
- **t**: Will be the accumulated sum of `s` values for the last test case.
- **c**: Will be the cumulative sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for the last test case.
- **k**: Will be the remaining `k` after all iterations for the last test case.
- **i**: Will be `n` for the last test case.
- **n, m, k**: Will be the values from the last test case.
- **l**: Will be the sorted list from the last test case.
- **s**: Will be the minimum of `m` and `k` in the last iteration of the last test case.

### Output State Format:
Since the problem asks for the output state after all executions of the loop, we focus on the final state of the last test case.

Output State: **t is the accumulated sum of s values for the last test case; c is the cumulative sum of s * (l[i] + t) for the last test case; k is the remaining k after all iterations for the last test case; i is n for the last test case; n, m, and k are the integers read from the input for the last test case; l is a sorted list of integers read from the input for the last test case; s is the minimum of m and k in the last iteration of the last test case.**

In simpler terms, the final output state reflects the state of the variables after processing the last test case, specifically focusing on the cumulative cost `c` which is printed at the end of each test case.
