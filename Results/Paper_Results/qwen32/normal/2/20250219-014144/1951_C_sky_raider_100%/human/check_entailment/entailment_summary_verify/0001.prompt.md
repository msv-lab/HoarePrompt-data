You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

            c += s * (l[i] + t)
            t += s

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a cumulative sum based on specific rules involving the sorted list and the constraints provided.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days.
- Each day has a price `a_i` for a ticket.
- We can buy up to `m` tickets per day.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on all subsequent days by `x`.

### Objective:
Find the minimum spending to purchase exactly `k` tickets.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It also reads the list of prices `l`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list of prices `l` is sorted in ascending order. This is a key step because it ensures we are always buying tickets on the cheapest available days first, which is a greedy approach to minimize cost.

3. **Buying Tickets**:
   - The program initializes `t` (total increase in price due to previous purchases), `s` (tickets bought on the current day), and `c` (total cost).
   - It iterates through each day `i`:
     - `s` is set to the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets allowed per day) and `k` (remaining tickets to be bought).
     - The cost for the tickets bought on day `i` is added to `c`. This cost is calculated as `s * (l[i] + t)`, where `l[i]` is the original price on day `i` and `t` is the accumulated price increase.
     - `t` is incremented by `s` to reflect the new price increase for subsequent days.
     - `k` is decremented by `s` to reflect the tickets bought.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all days for a test case, the total cost `c` is printed.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The sorting of prices ensures that the cheapest tickets are bought first, which aligns with the greedy strategy to minimize cost.
- The logic for calculating the cost and updating the price increase is correctly implemented.
- The loop continues until all `k` tickets are bought, and the total cost is correctly computed and printed.

Given this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
