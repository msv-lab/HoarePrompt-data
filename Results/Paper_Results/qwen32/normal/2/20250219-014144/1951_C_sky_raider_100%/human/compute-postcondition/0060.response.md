The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5. The value of `n` must still be greater than 5 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is `s`, `c` is `c + s * l[4]`, `k` is `k - s`, `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5, `m` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`**
