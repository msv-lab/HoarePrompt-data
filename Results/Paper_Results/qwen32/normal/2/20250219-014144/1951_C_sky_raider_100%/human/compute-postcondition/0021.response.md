The code snippet provided modifies the value of `k` by subtracting `s` from it. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `s`, `c`, and `t`) remain unchanged in terms of their expressions relative to other variables, but their values are based on the initial conditions given.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than `i`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `s` is `min(m, k)`
- `c` is `c + s * (l[i] + t)`
- `t` is `t + s`

After executing `k -= s`, the value of `k` is reduced by `s`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is `i + 1`; `s` is `min(m, k)`; `c` is `c + s * (l[i] + t)`; `t` is `t + s`; `k` is `k - s`.**
