To determine the new state after executing the given code, we need to focus on the line `beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Here's the breakdown:

- `required_mod_x` is 1.
- `required_mod_y` is 5.
- `freq` is `{(4, 6): 2}`.

The key point here is that the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` which is `(1, 5)` does not exist in the dictionary `freq`. Therefore, accessing `freq[(1, 5)]` will raise a `KeyError`. However, since the problem specifies to strictly follow the given format and assume no errors occur, we'll proceed under the assumption that the key exists or handle it gracefully as per the context.

Given the context and assuming the key exists or is handled, let's consider the hypothetical scenario where `freq[(1, 5)]` would return a value, say `0` (since it's not explicitly defined in the given `freq` dictionary).

Thus, `beautiful_count` would remain unchanged if the key does not exist or increment by the value associated with the key if it did exist.

Since the key `(1, 5)` does not exist in the `freq` dictionary, we can infer that `freq[(1, 5)]` would logically be `0` in this context, and thus `beautiful_count` would not change.

Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the `beautiful_count` which would hypothetically be updated if the key existed. Since it doesn't, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `mod_x` is 5, `mod_y` is 5, `required_mod_x` is 1, `required_mod_y` is 5, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `freq` is `{(4, 6): 2}`, `num` is 5`.**
