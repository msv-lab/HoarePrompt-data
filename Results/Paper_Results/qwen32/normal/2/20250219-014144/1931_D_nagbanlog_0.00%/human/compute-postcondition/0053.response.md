The given code snippet calculates `mod_y` as the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. However, `num` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `num` was intended to be one of the variables provided (like `x` or another), I'll proceed with the assumption that `num` was meant to be `x` (since `x` is 6 and `y` is 8).

Given `x` is 6 and `y` is 8, `mod_y` would be calculated as `6 % 8`, which equals 6.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])], `results` is [0], `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is [4, 5, 6], `freq` is {}, `beautiful_count` is 0, `case` is (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6]), `mod_x` is 4, `mod_y` is 6**.
