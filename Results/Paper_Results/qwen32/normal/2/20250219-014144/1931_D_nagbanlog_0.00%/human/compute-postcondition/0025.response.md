To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to evaluate the values of the variables mentioned in the string formatting part of the code. Let's break down the variables and their values based on the initial state provided:

- `num` is explicitly given as 3.
- `mod_x` is explicitly given as 3.
- `mod_y` is explicitly given as 3.
- `required_mod_x` is explicitly given as 2.
- `required_mod_y` is explicitly given as 3.

Using these explicit values, we can substitute them into the formatted string to determine the output.

Here is the formatted string with the substituted values:
```
f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
```

Substituting the values:
```
f'Number: 3, mod_x: 3, mod_y: 3, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 3'
```

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **Number: 3, mod_x: 3, mod_y: 3, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 3**
