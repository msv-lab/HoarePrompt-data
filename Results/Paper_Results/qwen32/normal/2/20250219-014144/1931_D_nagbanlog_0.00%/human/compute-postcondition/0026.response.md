To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 1
- `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]`
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is 3
- `x` is 5
- `y` is 7
- `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`
- `mod_x` is 3
- `mod_y` is 3
- `required_mod_x` is 2
- `required_mod_y` is 3
- `freq[(3, 5)]` is 1
- `num` is 3

The line of code increments `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Given `required_mod_x` is 2 and `required_mod_y` is 3, the key `(2, 3)` is used to access the dictionary `freq`. However, there is no entry for `(2, 3)` in the provided initial state, so we assume the default value for missing keys in a dictionary is 0.

Therefore, `freq[2, 3]` would be 0, and `beautiful_count` remains unchanged if it was not previously defined. Since `beautiful_count` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it starts at 0. Thus, `beautiful_count` becomes 0 + 0 = 0.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 3, `x` is 5, `y` is 7, `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `mod_x` is 3, `mod_y` is 3, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 3, `freq[(3, 5)]` is 1, `num` is 3, `beautiful_count` is 0**.
