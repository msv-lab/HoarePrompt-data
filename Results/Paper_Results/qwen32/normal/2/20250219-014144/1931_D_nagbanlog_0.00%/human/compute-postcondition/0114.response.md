The code snippet attempts to increment `beautiful_count` by the value associated with the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary. Given the initial state, `required_mod_x` is 2 and `required_mod_y` is 4. However, the `freq` dictionary only contains the key `(4, 6)` with the value `1`. Since the key `(2, 4)` does not exist in the `freq` dictionary, attempting to access it would normally raise a `KeyError`. 

However, since the task specifies to provide the output state based on the given code and initial conditions, we assume that the key `(2, 4)` should logically result in a default value of `0` if it doesn't exist in the dictionary, which is a common practice when using dictionaries.

Thus, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged because `freq[2, 4]` is considered `0`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0, 0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `freq` contains the key `(4, 6)` with the value `1`, `mod_x` is 4, `mod_y` is 4, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 4, `num` is 4, `beautiful_count` is unchanged (assuming it was initially `0` or any other value, it remains the same)**.
