The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified, and no computations are performed. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and `test_cases` contains specific tuples and lists as described. Since the code only initializes `results` without altering any other variables or performing any operations, the output state remains consistent with the initial state except for the new variable `results`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case in `test_cases` is a tuple containing three integers (n, x, y) such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and a list of n integers `a` where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list.**
