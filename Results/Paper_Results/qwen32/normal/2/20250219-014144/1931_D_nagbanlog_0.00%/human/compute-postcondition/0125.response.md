The given code snippet increments the variable `beautiful_count` by the value associated with the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `required_mod_x` is 0
- `required_mod_y` is 6
- `freq` contains the key `(4, 6)` with the value `1` and the key `(4, 4)` with the value `1`.

Since the key `(0, 6)` does not exist in the dictionary `freq`, accessing `freq[0, 6]` would normally raise a `KeyError`. However, since the problem specifies the behavior without handling exceptions, we assume that the key `(0, 6)` should logically have a default value of `0` if it does not exist.

Therefore, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged because `freq[0, 6]` is effectively `0`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0, 0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `freq` contains the key `(4, 6)` with the value `1` and the key `(4, 4)` with the value `1`, `mod_x` is 0, `mod_y` is 6, `required_mod_x` is 0, `required_mod_y` is 6, `num` is 6, `beautiful_count` is unchanged**.
