Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])], `results` is [0], `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is [4, 5, 6], `case` is (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6]), `mod_x` is 4, `mod_y` is 6, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 6. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`, then `freq[(4, 6)]` is set to 0 and `(mod_x, mod_y)` is added to `freq`. `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.**
