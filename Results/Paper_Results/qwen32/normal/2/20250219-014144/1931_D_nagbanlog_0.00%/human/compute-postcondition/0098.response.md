Let's calculate the new value of `required_mod_x` using the given formula:

`required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x`

Given:
- `x` is 6
- `mod_x` is 4

Substituting these values into the formula:

`required_mod_x = (6 - 4) % 6`
`required_mod_x = 2 % 6`
`required_mod_x = 2`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0, 0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `freq` is `{}`, `mod_x` is 4, `mod_y` is 6, `required_mod_x` is 2`**
