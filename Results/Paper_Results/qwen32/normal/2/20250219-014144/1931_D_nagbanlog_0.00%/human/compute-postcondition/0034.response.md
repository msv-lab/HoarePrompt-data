To determine the new value of `required_mod_x`, we use the given formula: `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x`. Given that `x` is 5 and `mod_x` is 3, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ required\_mod\_x = (5 - 3) \% 5 \]
\[ required\_mod\_x = 2 \% 5 \]
\[ required\_mod\_x = 2 \]

Thus, `required_mod_x` is updated to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3])]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 3, `x` is 5, `y` is 7, `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `mod_x` is 3, `mod_y` is 3, `required_mod_x` is 2, `required_mod_y` is 3, `freq[(3, 5)]` is 1, `freq[(3, 3)]` is 1, `num` is 3**.
