The only variable in the loop head is `num`, and the iterable is `a`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, `a` must be a non-empty list. The current state already shows that `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, which is a non-empty list. Thus, no adjustment is needed for `a` or `num` to ensure the loop executes.

However, since the question asks us to specify the state ensuring the loop can execute, we should confirm that `a` is indeed non-empty:

State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is `[(3, 5, 7, [1, 2, 3]), (4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])]`, `results` is `[0, 0]`, `n` is 4, `x` is 6, `y` is 8, `a` is `[4, 5, 6]`, `case` is `(4, 6, 8, [4, 5, 6])`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `freq` is `{}`**
