To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to carefully analyze the given loop and its conditions. The loop continues as long as both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true. Additionally, inside the loop, `cnt` is incremented based on the condition that `gcd(x, y) == 1`.

Let's break down the given information and simulate the loop step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `x = 3`
- `y = 1`
- `cnt = 9`
- `n >= 9`
- `m` is not specified but it must be such that the loop can run at least 3 times based on the given outputs.

### Iteration Details:
1. **First Iteration:**
   - `x = 3`, `y = 2`
   - Conditions: `(3 + 2) * 3 <= n` → `15 <= n` and `(3 + 2) * 2 <= m` → `10 <= m`
   - `gcd(3, 2) == 1` → True
   - `cnt += min(n // 15, m // 10)` → Assuming `n >= 15` and `m >= 10`, let's say `n = 15` and `m = 10` for simplicity, then `cnt += min(15 // 15, 10 // 10) = min(1, 1) = 1`
   - New `cnt = 9 + 1 = 10`
   - Increment `y` → `y = 3`

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - `x = 3`, `y = 3`
   - Conditions: `(3 + 3) * 3 <= n` → `18 <= n` and `(3 + 3) * 3 <= m` → `18 <= m`
   - `gcd(3, 3) == 1` → False
   - `cnt` remains unchanged → `cnt = 10`
   - Increment `y` → `y = 4`

3. **Third Iteration:**
   - `x = 3`, `y = 4`
   - Conditions: `(3 + 4) * 3 <= n` → `21 <= n` and `(3 + 4) * 4 <= m` → `28 <= m`
   - Since `n` and `m` must satisfy these conditions, let's assume `n >= 21` and `m >= 28`. However, since `gcd(3, 4) == 1` → True
   - `cnt += min(n // 21, m // 28)` → Assuming `n = 21` and `m = 28`, then `cnt += min(21 // 21, 28 // 28) = min(1, 1) = 1`
   - New `cnt = 10 + 1 = 11`
   - Increment `y` → `y = 5`

4. **Fourth Iteration:**
   - `x = 3`, `y = 5`
   - Conditions: `(3 + 5) * 3 <= n` → `24 <= n` and `(3 + 5) * 5 <= m` → `40 <= m`
   - `gcd(3, 5) == 1` → True
   - `cnt += min(n // 24, m // 40)` → Assuming `n = 24` and `m = 40`, then `cnt += min(24 // 24, 40 // 40) = min(1, 1) = 1`
   - New `cnt = 11 + 1 = 12`
   - Increment `y` → `y = 6`

5. **Fifth Iteration:**
   - `x = 3`, `y = 6`
   - Conditions: `(3 + 6) * 3 <= n` → `27 <= n` and `(3 + 6) * 6 <= m` → `54 <= m`
   - `gcd(3, 6) == 1` → False
   - `cnt` remains unchanged → `cnt = 12`
   - Increment `y` → `y = 7`

   - `x = 3`, `y = 7`
   - Conditions: `(3 + 7) * 3 <= n` → `30 <= n` and `(3 + 7) * 7 <= m` → `70 <= m`
   - `gcd(3, 7) == 1` → True
   - `cnt += min(n // 30, m // 70)` → Assuming `n = 30` and `m = 70`, then `cnt += min(30 // 30, 70 // 70) = min(1, 1) = 1`
   - New `cnt = 12 + 1 = 13`
   - Increment `y` → `y = 8`

7. **Seventh Iteration:**
   - `x = 3`, `y = 8`
   - Conditions: `(3 + 8) * 3 <= n` → `33 <= n` and `(3 + 8) * 8 <= m` → `88 <= m`
   - `gcd(3, 8) == 1` → True
   - `cnt += min(n // 33, m // 88)` → Assuming `n = 33` and `m = 88`, then `cnt += min(33 // 33, 88 // 88) = min(1, 1) = 1`
   - New `cnt = 13 + 1 = 14`
   - Increment `y` → `y = 9`

8. **Eighth Iteration:**
   - `x = 3`, `y = 9`
   - Conditions: `(3 + 9) * 3 <= n` → `36 <= n` and `(3 + 9) * 9 <= m` → `108 <= m`
   - `gcd(3, 9) == 1` → False
   - `cnt` remains unchanged → `cnt = 14`
   - Increment `y` → `y = 10`

9. **Ninth Iteration:**
   - `x = 3`, `y = 10`
   - Conditions: `(3 + 10) * 3 <= n` → `39 <= n` and `(3 + 10) * 10 <= m` → `130 <= m`
   - `gcd(3, 10) == 1` → True
   - `cnt += min(n // 39, m // 130)` → Assuming `n = 39` and `m = 130`, then `cnt += min(39 // 39, 130 // 130) = min(1, 1) = 1`
   - New `cnt = 14 + 1 = 15`
   - Increment `y` → `y = 11`

10. **Tenth Iteration:**
    - `x = 3`, `y = 11`
    - Conditions: `(3 + 11) * 3 <= n` → `42 <= n` and `(3 + 11) * 11 <= m` → `154 <= m`
    - `gcd(3, 11) == 1` → True
    - `cnt += min(n // 42, m // 154)` → Assuming `n = 42` and `m = 154`, then `cnt += min(42 // 42, 154 // 154) = min(1, 1) = 1`
    - New `cnt = 15 + 1 = 16`
    - Increment `y` → `y = 12`

11. **Eleventh Iteration:**
    - `x = 3`, `y = 12`
    - Conditions: `(3 + 12) * 3 <= n` → `45 <= n` and `(3 + 12) * 12 <= m` → `180 <= m`
    - `gcd(3, 12) == 1` → False
    - `cnt` remains unchanged → `cnt = 16`
    - Increment `y` → `y = 13`

12. **Twelfth Iteration:**
    - `x = 3`, `y = 13`
    - Conditions: `(3 + 13) * 3 <= n` → `48 <= n` and `(3 + 13) * 13 <= m` → `208 <= m`
    - `gcd(3, 13) == 1` → True
    - `cnt += min(n // 48, m // 208)` → Assuming `n = 48` and `m = 208`, then `cnt += min(48 // 48, 208 // 208) = min(1, 1) = 1`
    - New `cnt = 16 + 1 = 17`
    - Increment `y` → `y = 14`

13. **Thirteenth Iteration:**
    - `x = 3`, `y = 14`
    - Conditions: `(3 + 14) * 3 <= n` → `51 <= n` and `(3 + 14) * 14 <= m` → `238 <= m`
    - `gcd(3, 14) == 1` → True
    - `cnt += min(n // 51, m // 238)` → Assuming `n = 51` and `m = 238`, then `cnt += min(51 // 51, 238 // 238) = min(1, 1) = 1`
    - New `cnt = 17 + 1 = 18`
    - Increment `y` → `y = 15`

14. **Fourteenth Iteration:**
    - `x = 3`, `y = 15`
    - Conditions: `(3 + 15) * 3 <= n` → `54 <= n` and `(3 + 15) * 15 <= m` → `270 <= m`
    - `gcd(3, 15) == 1` → False
    - `cnt` remains unchanged → `cnt = 18`
    - Increment `y` → `y = 16`

At this point, we observe that `y` keeps increasing, and the gcd condition fails frequently, preventing `cnt` from increasing further significantly. Let's assume `n` and `m` are sufficiently large to allow the loop to run until `y` reaches a point where `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`.

### Final State:
- After analyzing the pattern and conditions, we conclude that the loop will eventually terminate when `y` becomes large enough such that one of the conditions `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m` fails.
- Given the pattern, the final value of `cnt` stabilizes at `18` after several iterations where `gcd(x, y) == 1` is true.

Output State: **x is 3, y is 16, cnt is 18, n is greater than or equal to 54, m is greater than or equal to 270.**

In natural language, the final state after all iterations of the loop is that `x` remains 3, `y` has incremented to 16, `cnt` has reached 18, and `n` and `m` must be at least 54 and 270 respectively to allow the loop to run to this point.
