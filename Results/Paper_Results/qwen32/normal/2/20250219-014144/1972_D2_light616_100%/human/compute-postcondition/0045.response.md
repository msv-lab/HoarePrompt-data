To determine the new value of `cnt`, we need to evaluate the expression `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` using the given initial state.

Given:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 2
- `n` must be at least 15
- `m` must be at least 10
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1 (which is true since gcd(3, 2) = 1)
- `cnt` is initially `9 + min(n // 12, m // 4)`

First, let's compute the initial value of `cnt`:
- `min(n // 12, m // 4)` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`. Since `n` is at least 15 and `m` is at least 10, let's consider the minimum possible values:
  - `n // 12` is at least `15 // 12 = 1`
  - `m // 4` is at least `10 // 4 = 2`
- Therefore, `min(n // 12, m // 4)` is at least 1.
- So, `cnt` is initially at least `9 + 1 = 10`.

Next, let's compute the increment to `cnt`:
- The expression `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` needs to be evaluated:
  - `x + y` is `3 + 2 = 5`
  - `(x + y) * x` is `5 * 3 = 15`
  - `(x + y) * y` is `5 * 2 = 10`
  - `n // 15` depends on the specific value of `n`. Since `n` is at least 15, `n // 15` is at least `15 // 15 = 1`.
  - `m // 10` depends on the specific value of `m`. Since `m` is at least 10, `m // 10` is at least `10 // 10 = 1`.
- Therefore, `min(n // 15, m // 10)` is at least 1.

So, `cnt` is incremented by at least 1.

Combining these results:
- The initial value of `cnt` is at least 10.
- `cnt` is incremented by at least 1.
- Therefore, the final value of `cnt` is at least 11.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not specified beyond their minimums, we can only say that `cnt` is at least 11. However, for the sake of providing a specific output state, we will assume the minimum possible values for `n` and `m` to illustrate the calculation.

Let's assume `n = 15` and `m = 10`:
- `cnt` initially is `9 + min(15 // 12, 10 // 4) = 9 + min(1, 2) = 9 + 1 = 10`
- Increment to `cnt` is `min(15 // 15, 10 // 10) = min(1, 1) = 1`
- Final `cnt` is `10 + 1 = 11`

Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 2, `n` must be at least 15, `m` must be at least 10, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` is 11.**
