### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and compare it with the problem statement.

#### Problem Statement:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
- 1 ≤ a ≤ n
- 1 ≤ b ≤ m
- b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

#### Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - Iterates over possible values of `x` from 1 up to the square root of `n`.
   - For each `x`, iterates over possible values of `y` starting from 1.
   - Checks if `(x + y) * x` is less than or equal to `n` and `(x + y) * y` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
   - Prints the count `cnt` after the loops complete.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Issues with the Code:
- The logic inside `func_1` does not correctly implement the problem statement. Specifically, the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` is not being checked.
- The code only considers pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and counts them based on the divisibility condition, but it does not directly check the required condition for `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`.

#### Correct Implementation:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges and check if `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0`. However, due to the constraints, a direct approach would be too slow. Instead, optimizations or mathematical insights are needed.

Given the current implementation, it does not correctly solve the problem as per the provided logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
