To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are true.

Given the current state:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 3
- `n` is at least 15
- `m` is at least 10
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1
- `cnt` is 11

Let's evaluate the conditions:
1. `(x + y) * x = (3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`
2. `(x + y) * y = (3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`

Since `18` is not less than or equal to `n` (which is at least 15) and `18` is not less than or equal to `m` (which is at least 10), the loop cannot execute again with the current values of `x` and `y`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `x` and `y` such that both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` hold true.

Let's choose smaller values for `x` and `y`:
- Let `x` be 2
- Let `y` be 2

Then:
1. `(x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`
2. `(x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`

Since `8` is less than or equal to `n` (which is at least 15) and `8` is less than or equal to `m` (which is at least 10), the loop can execute again with these values.

Therefore, the state should be modified as follows:
State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` is at least 15, `m` is at least 10, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` is 11**
