### Reasoning:

The given program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of `x` and `y`:
     - The outer loop iterates `x` from 1 to `sqrt(n)`.
     - The inner loop iterates `y` from 1 until `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`.
   - Inside the inner loop, it checks if `gcd(x, y) == 1`. If true, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

The logic in `func_1` is attempting to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`. However, the current implementation does not correctly achieve this goal.

Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

- The loop conditions and the logic inside the loops do not correctly capture all valid pairs `(a, b)`.
- Specifically, the condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is too restrictive. It only considers pairs where `x` and `y` are coprime, which is not necessary for the condition `b * gcd(a, b) % (a + b) == 0` to hold.
- The calculation of `cnt` using `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is also incorrect because it doesn't properly account for all valid pairs `(a, b)`.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis above, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
