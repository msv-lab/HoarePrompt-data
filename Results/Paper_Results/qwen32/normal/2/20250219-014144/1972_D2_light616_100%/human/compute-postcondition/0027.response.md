To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
(x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `cnt` is 6 if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1
- `n` is at least 6
- `m` is at least 3

Let's evaluate the conditions with the current values of `x` and `y`:

1. `(x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`
2. `(x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`

For the loop to continue executing, both conditions must be true:
1. `8 <= n`
2. `8 <= m`

Given that `n` is at least 6 and `m` is at least 3, these conditions are not satisfied because `n` and `m` need to be at least 8.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `n` and `m` to be at least 8.

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 6 if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, `n` must be at least 8, and `m` must be at least 8**
