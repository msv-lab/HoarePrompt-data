To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Given the state right before the loop:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1
- `cnt` is 5
- `n` must be at least 4

We need to ensure both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are satisfied.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1:** `(x + y) * x <= n`
   - Substitute the values of `x` and `y`: `(2 + 1) * 2 <= n`
   - Simplify: `3 * 2 <= n` => `6 <= n`
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 6 to satisfy this condition.

2. **Condition 2:** `(x + y) * y <= m`
   - Substitute the values of `x` and `y`: `(2 + 1) * 1 <= m`
   - Simplify: `3 * 1 <= m` => `3 <= m`
   - Therefore, `m` must be at least 3 to satisfy this condition.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The original state specifies that `n` must be at least 4. However, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 6.
- There is no mention of `m` in the original state, but for the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 3.

### Final State:
- `x` remains 2.
- `y` remains 1.
- `cnt` remains 5.
- `n` must be at least 6.
- `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 1, `cnt` is 5, `n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 3**
