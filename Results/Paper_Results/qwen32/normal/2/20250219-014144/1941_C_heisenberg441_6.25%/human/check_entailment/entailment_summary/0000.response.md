### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Requirements:
- We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to ensure that it no longer contains the substrings "map" or "pie".
- The program should handle multiple test cases.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initial Check for Specific Case**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the string `s` is exactly 'mapie'. If it is, the function returns 1. This is an incorrect approach because removing one character from 'mapie' to make it beautiful is not necessarily the optimal solution. For instance, removing the 'a' would result in 'mpie', which still contains 'pie'. Instead, removing the 'm' or 'p' would yield 'apie' or 'maie', respectively, neither of which contain 'map' or 'pie'.

2. **Removing Substrings**:
   - The function then enters two loops:
     - The first loop removes occurrences of the substring 'map' by finding its index and removing two characters starting from that index.
     - The second loop removes occurrences of the substring 'pie' similarly.
   - Each removal increments the `ans` counter, which tracks the total number of deletions made.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The outer loop iterates through each test case, calling `func_1` with the respective string and printing the result.

#### Issues Identified:
- The initial check for 'mapie' is incorrect and unnecessary.
- The removal process is flawed because it does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie'. For example, consider the string 'mapiepie'. Removing 'map' first results in 'iepie', which still contains 'pie'. However, removing 'pie' first results in 'map', which still contains 'map'. The optimal solution would be to remove the 'p' in 'mapiepie' to get 'maieie', which requires only one deletion.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not always provide the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
