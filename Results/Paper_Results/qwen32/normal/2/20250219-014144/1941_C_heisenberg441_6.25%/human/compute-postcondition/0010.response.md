To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition:

```
while s.find('map') != -1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as the string `s` contains the substring `'map'`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6
- `s` is a string that contains the substring `'m'` (with `'a'` and `'p'` removed from the first `'map'`)
- `ans` is 2

Since the loop condition checks for the presence of the substring `'map'` in `s`, we need to ensure that `s` still contains `'map'` for the loop to execute again.

### Analysis:
- The variables `t`, `n`, and `ans` do not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.
- The string `s` must contain the substring `'map'` for the loop to execute again. Since the problem states that `'a'` and `'p'` were removed from the first occurrence of `'map'` in `s`, we need to add `'a'` and `'p'` back to `s` to form the substring `'map'`.

### Adjustment:
- We need to modify `s` such that it contains the substring `'map'`. Since `'a'` and `'p'` were removed from the first `'map'`, we can add them back to the appropriate position in `s`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `s` to include the substring `'map'`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `s` must contain the substring 'map', `ans` is 2**
