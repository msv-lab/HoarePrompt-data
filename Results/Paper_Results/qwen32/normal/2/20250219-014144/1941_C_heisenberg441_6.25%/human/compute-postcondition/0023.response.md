To determine the final output state after all iterations of the given loop, we need to analyze how the loop modifies the string `s` and the variable `ans`. The loop continues to execute as long as the substring `'pie'` is found in `s`. Each iteration removes the first occurrence of `'pie'` from `s` and increments `ans` by 1.

Given the loop:
```python
while s.find('pie') != -1:
    s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
    ans += 1
```

Let's break down the changes:
- `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `n` (the length of `s`) will decrease by 1 for each `'pie'` removed because `'pie'` has 3 characters and we remove 2 characters (`ie`), effectively reducing the length by 1.
- `s` will no longer contain any occurrences of the substring `'pie'`.
- `ans` will be equal to the total number of `'pie'` substrings removed from `s`.

The final output state after all iterations can be described as:
- `t` remains the same as the initial state.
- `n` is reduced by the number of `'pie'` substrings removed.
- `s` does not contain any `'pie'` substrings.
- `ans` is equal to the number of `'pie'` substrings removed from `s`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` is reduced by the number of 'pie' substrings removed, `s` does not contain any 'pie' substrings, `ans` is equal to the number of 'pie' substrings removed.**
