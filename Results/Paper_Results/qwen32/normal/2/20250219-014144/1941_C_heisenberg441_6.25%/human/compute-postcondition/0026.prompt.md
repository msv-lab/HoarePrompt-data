You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1(s):
    if (s == 'mapie') :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. Additionally, s is not equal to 'mapie'.
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: - `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
    #- `n` will be reduced by 2 for each occurrence of `'map'` removed from `s`. Therefore, the new length of `s` will be `n - 2 * (number of 'map' occurrences)`.
    #- `s` will no longer contain the substring `'map'`.
    #- `ans` will be equal to the total number of `'map'` substrings removed from `s`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state can be described as:
    #
    #Output State:
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `n` is reduced by the number of 'pie' substrings removed, `s` does not contain any 'pie' substrings, `ans` is equal to the number of 'pie' substrings removed.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of 'pie' substrings removed from the string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. If the string `s` does not contain the substring 'pie', the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the number of 'pie' substrings removed from the string `s`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns the number of 'pie' substrings removed from the string `s`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
