### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Initial Check for Specific String**:
   ```python
   if (s == 'mapie'):
       return 1
   ```
   This part of the code checks if the string `s` is exactly `"mapie"`. If it is, the function returns `1`, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The problem requires us to return the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful. For the string `"mapie"`, we need to remove two characters ("ma" or "ie") to make it beautiful, not one. Hence, this part of the code is incorrect.

2. **Removing Substrings "map" and "pie"**:
   ```python
   ans = 0
   while s.find('map') != -1:
       s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
       ans += 1
   while s.find('pie') != -1:
       s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
       ans += 1
   return ans
   ```
   This part of the code correctly identifies and removes the substrings `"map"` and `"pie"` from the string `s`. It counts how many times these substrings are found and removed, and returns the count as the result.

### Conclusion:

The initial check for the string `"mapie"` is incorrect because it does not return the correct number of deletions required. The rest of the function correctly handles the removal of `"map"` and `"pie"` substrings. However, due to the incorrect handling of the specific case `"mapie"`, the entire function is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
