Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string `s` to make it beautiful.
2. **Definition of Beautiful String**: A string is beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".
3. **Approach**: The program should iteratively remove occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string and count the number of removals until neither substring is present.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` is supposed to compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string `s` beautiful.
   
2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The code checks if `s` is exactly "mapie". If true, it returns 1. However, this special case handling is unnecessary because the subsequent logic would correctly handle this case as well. This special case can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.
   
3. **Main Logic**:
   - The code uses two `while` loops to repeatedly find and remove the substrings "map" and "pie" from the string `s`.
   - For each removal, it increments the counter `ans`.
   - The loop continues until no more occurrences of "map" or "pie" are found in the string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty String**: If the input string is empty, the function will return 0, which is correct since an empty string does not contain "map" or "pie".
   - **Strings Without "map" or "pie"**: If the string does not contain either "map" or "pie", the function will return 0, which is correct.
   - **Strings Containing Only "map" or "pie"**: The function will correctly remove all occurrences and return the correct count of deletions.

5. **Efficiency Consideration**:
   - The use of `s.find()` inside the loop can be inefficient for very large strings due to repeated scanning. However, the problem constraints allow for this approach to work within acceptable time limits given the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^6\).

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. It handles all edge cases appropriately and adheres to the problem requirements.

**Correctness:** **True**
