Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to make a string `s` beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters.
- A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
- We need to handle multiple test cases, each with a different string `s`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and processes each string `s` using the function `func_1`. Here's a breakdown of `func_1`:

1. **Initial Check**: It checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie", which is not a valid case since "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie". This check seems unnecessary and incorrect.
2. **Removing "map" Substrings**: It repeatedly finds the first occurrence of "map" in `s`, removes it by concatenating the parts before and after "map", and increments the counter `ans`.
3. **Removing "pie" Substrings**: Similarly, it repeatedly finds the first occurrence of "pie" in `s`, removes it, and increments the counter `ans`.
4. **Return the Count**: Finally, it returns the count of removed substrings.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Incorrect Initial Check**: The initial check for `s == 'mapie'` is incorrect because "mapie" contains both "map" and "pie". This check should be removed.
2. **Greedy Approach**: The current approach greedily removes the first occurrence of "map" or "pie" found in the string. However, this might not always yield the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. For example, consider the string "mpaie". The greedy approach would remove "map" first, leaving "ie", but the optimal solution would be to remove "pie" directly, resulting in no deletions.
3. **Efficiency**: The repeated calls to `find` and string slicing can be inefficient, especially for large strings.

### Correctness Verification:
To verify correctness, we need to check if the program handles all edge cases correctly. Let's consider some test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `s = "mapie"`
   - Expected Output: 2 (remove "map" and "pie")
   - Actual Output: 1 (incorrect due to the initial check)

2. **Test Case 2**: `s = "mpaie"`
   - Expected Output: 0 (no removal needed)
   - Actual Output: 1 (incorrect due to greedy approach)

Since the program fails these test cases, it is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program incorrectly handles certain cases due to the unnecessary initial check and the greedy approach to removing substrings. These issues lead to incorrect results for some inputs.
