You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    if s == 'mapie':
        return 1
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1(s):
    if (s == 'mapie') :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. Additionally, s is not equal to 'mapie'.
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: - `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
    #- `n` will be reduced by 2 for each occurrence of `'map'` removed from `s`. Therefore, the new length of `s` will be `n - 2 * (number of 'map' occurrences)`.
    #- `s` will no longer contain the substring `'map'`.
    #- `ans` will be equal to the total number of `'map'` substrings removed from `s`.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state can be described as:
    #
    #Output State:
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `n` is reduced by the number of 'pie' substrings removed, `s` does not contain any 'pie' substrings, `ans` is equal to the number of 'pie' substrings removed.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of 'pie' substrings removed from the string `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string `s` to make it beautiful.
2. **Definition of Beautiful String**: A string is beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".
3. **Approach**: The program should iteratively remove occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string and count the number of removals until neither substring is present.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` is supposed to compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string `s` beautiful.
   
2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The code checks if `s` is exactly "mapie". If true, it returns 1. However, this special case handling is unnecessary because the subsequent logic would correctly handle this case as well. This special case can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.
   
3. **Main Logic**:
   - The code uses two `while` loops to repeatedly find and remove the substrings "map" and "pie" from the string `s`.
   - For each removal, it increments the counter `ans`.
   - The loop continues until no more occurrences of "map" or "pie" are found in the string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty String**: If the input string is empty, the function will return 0, which is correct since an empty string does not contain "map" or "pie".
   - **Strings Without "map" or "pie"**: If the string does not contain either "map" or "pie", the function will return 0, which is correct.
   - **Strings Containing Only "map" or "pie"**: The function will correctly remove all occurrences and return the correct count of deletions.

5. **Efficiency Consideration**:
   - The use of `s.find()` inside the loop can be inefficient for very large strings due to repeated scanning. However, the problem constraints allow for this approach to work within acceptable time limits given the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^6\).

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. It handles all edge cases appropriately and adheres to the problem requirements.

**Correctness:** **True**
