To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition inside the loop head. The loop will execute as long as the condition `s.find('pie') != -1` is true, meaning the string `s` must contain the substring `'pie'`.

Given the initial state description:
- `t` remains unchanged and is not relevant to the loop condition.
- `n` is adjusted based on the removal of `'map'` substrings, but this does not affect the presence of `'pie'` in `s`.
- `s` will no longer contain `'map'` after some processing, but we need to ensure it contains `'pie'` for the loop to run.
- `ans` tracks the number of `'map'` substrings removed, which is also irrelevant to the loop condition.

Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is `s` to ensure it contains the substring `'pie'`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Identify the Condition**: The loop will execute if `s.find('pie') != -1`, meaning `s` must contain `'pie'`.
2. **Adjust `s`**: To satisfy the condition, `s` must include the substring `'pie'`.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged as per the given information (it is derived from the removal of `'map'` substrings).
- `s` must contain the substring `'pie'`.
- `ans` remains unchanged as it is related to the removal of `'map'` substrings.

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `s` must contain the substring `'pie'`, `ans` remains unchanged**

This ensures that the `while` loop can execute at least once because the condition `s.find('pie') != -1` will be true.
