Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is `abs(m - y2)`
- `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`
- `x1` is equal to `r[2] + a`
- `y1` is equal to `m`
- `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`
- `y2` is equal to `r[5]`
- `a` is equal to `m - r[3]` since `y2` is less than `y1`
- `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`
- `x2` is greater than `x1`
- `x1` is at least 1
- `x2` is less than or equal to `n`
- `y1` is greater than `y2`

Code Snippet:
```
y2 += a
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `y2` is incremented by `a`.

Updated Values:
- `y2` becomes `y2 + a`
- Since `a` is `m - r[3]`, `y2` becomes `y2 + (m - r[3])`

Other Variables:
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(m - y2)`, `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + a`, `y1` is equal to `m`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`, `y2` is equal to `r[5] + (m - r[3])`, `a` is equal to `m - r[3]`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `y1` is greater than `y2`**.

In simple terms, the value of `y2` has been updated to `y2 + (m - r[3])`. All other variables retain their initial values.
