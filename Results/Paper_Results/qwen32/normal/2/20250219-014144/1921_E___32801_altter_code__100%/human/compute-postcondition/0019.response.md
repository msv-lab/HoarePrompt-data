Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- `r` is a list containing six integers: `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`.
  - `h` and `w` are dimensions with constraints: `1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 1,000,000` and `1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 1,000,000,000`.
- `n` is assigned the value of `r[0]`, which is `h`.
- `m` is assigned the value of `r[1]`, which is `w`.
- `x1` is calculated as `r[2] + 1`, which is `x_a + 1`.
- `x2` is assigned the value of `r[4]`, which is `x_b`.
- It is given that `(x2 - x1)` is odd and `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- `y1` is assigned the value of `y2`, meaning `y1` and `y2` are the same (`y_a` and `y_b` are the same).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Alice'`. There are no variables or expressions being evaluated that depend on the initial state provided. The output is straightforward and does not change based on the values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `x2`, or `y1`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
