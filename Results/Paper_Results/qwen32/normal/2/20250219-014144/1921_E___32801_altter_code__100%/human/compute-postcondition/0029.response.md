Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`
- `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`
- `n` is equal to `r[0]` (which is `h`)
- `m` is equal to `r[1]` (which is `w`)
- `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1` (which is `x_a + 1`)
- `x2` is equal to `r[4]` (which is `x_b`)
- `y1` is incremented or decremented based on the comparison with `y2`
- `a` is `y2 - 1` if `y1 >= y2` else `m - y2` (which is `w - y2`)
- `b` is `x2 - x1` (which is `x_b - (x_a + 1)`)

Code Snippet:
```python
x1 += a
```

Impact:
- The value of `x1` is updated to `x1 + a`. Given `x1` was initially `x_a + 1`, it now becomes `(x_a + 1) + a`.

Therefore, the new value of `x1` is `(x_a + 1) + a`.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is `(x_a + 1) + a`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y1` is incremented or decremented based on the comparison with `y2`, `a` is `y2 - 1` if `y1 >= y2` else `m - y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`.**
