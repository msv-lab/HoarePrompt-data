Postcondition: **`t` is either `abs(y2 - y1)` or `abs(m - y1)`, `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is `(x_a + 1) + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y1` remains unchanged, `a` is `0`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `y2` is either `1` or `m`, and `c` is either `y1 - 1` or `1` or `-1` depending on the condition `y2 <= y1`. Additionally, either `b // 2 <= a` or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c` or `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m` or `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`**
