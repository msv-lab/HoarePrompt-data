Given the initial state, let's break down the variables and their values:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]` where:
  - 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6
  - 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9
- `n` is equal to `r[0]` (which is `h`)
- `m` is equal to `r[1]` (which is `w`)
- `x1` is equal to `r[2]` (which is `x_a`)
- `y1` is equal to `r[3]` (which is `y_a`)
- `x2` is equal to `r[4]` (which is `x_b`)
- `y2` is equal to `r[5]` (which is `y_b`)
- Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1)` is odd.
- The current value of `y1` is equal to the current value of `y2`.

The Python code snippet is simply:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables described in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'Alice'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **Alice**
