Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list containing six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9; `n` is equal to `r[0]`; `m` is equal to `r[1]`; `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`; `y1` is equal to `r[3] + 1`; `x2` is equal to `r[4]`; `y2` is equal to `r[5]`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1)` is odd. `y1` is not equal to `y2`. The current value of `y2` is greater than `y1`.** 

Natural Language: The value of `x1` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
