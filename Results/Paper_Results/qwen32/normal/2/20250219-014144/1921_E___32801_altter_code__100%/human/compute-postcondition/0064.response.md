Postcondition: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list containing six integers `[h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]`, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + a`, `y1` is equal to `r[3]`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `a` is equal to `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, otherwise `a` is equal to `m - y1`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`. Additionally, either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.**
