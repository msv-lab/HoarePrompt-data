The value of `t` is reassigned to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list containing six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9; `n` is equal to `r[0]`; `m` is equal to `r[1]`; `x1` is equal to `r[2]`; `y1` is equal to `r[3]`; `x2` is equal to `r[4]`; `y2` is equal to `r[5]`; `a` is equal to `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, otherwise `a` is equal to `m - y1`; `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.**
