Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, if `k` is within the range from 0 to `n * (n - 1) / 2`, it computes and returns a specific value or configuration related to these inputs; otherwise, it may handle the case where `k` exceeds this maximum possible value for a given `n`.**
