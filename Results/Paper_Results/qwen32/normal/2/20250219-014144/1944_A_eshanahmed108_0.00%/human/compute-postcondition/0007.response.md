The code snippet assigns the values of `n` and `k` from the input, which means the initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the new input values. Since the input values are not specified, we can only say that `n` and `k` are now the integers provided by the user.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the integer values from the input.**
