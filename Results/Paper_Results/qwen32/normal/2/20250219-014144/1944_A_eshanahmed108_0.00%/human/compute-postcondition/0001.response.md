Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split into two parts.**

Explanation: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially described. The input function reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to `n` and `k` respectively.
