To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `i` and `temp`. The loop continues multiplying `temp` by 2 until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`. At this point, the loop breaks.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `temp` starts at 1.
   - `i` starts at 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - In each iteration, if `temp * 2 < k`, then `temp` is doubled and `i` is incremented by 1.
   - This process repeats until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.

3. **Final State**:
   - The loop stops when `temp * 2 >= k`.
   - The final value of `temp` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
   - The final value of `i` will be the number of times `temp` was doubled before the condition `temp * 2 >= k` became true.

Let's formalize this:

- If `k = 1`, the loop doesn't execute because `temp * 2` (which is 2) is not less than `k`.
- If `k = 2`, the loop executes once (`temp` becomes 2, `i` becomes 1), but then `temp * 2` (which is 4) is not less than `k`, so it breaks.
- For any `k > 2`, the loop doubles `temp` until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`.

Given the pattern, the final state of `temp` will be `2^m` where `2^m < k` and `2^(m+1) >= k`. The final state of `i` will be `m`.

### Final Output State

- `t` remains the same.
- `l1` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `arr` remains an empty list.
- `ans` remains an empty list.
- `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`.
- `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.
- `k0` remains the same as `k`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `k0` is equal to `k`.**
