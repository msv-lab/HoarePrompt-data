The code snippet `ans.append((1 << i) - 1)` appends a new value to the list `ans`. The value being appended is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is equivalent to \(2^i - 1\). This operation does not affect any other variables except `ans`, which now includes the newly computed value.

Natural Language Explanation: The list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is \(2^i - 1\). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` remains a list of strings; `n` remains the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` remains the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` remains an empty list; `k0` remains equal to `k`; `ans` is now a list containing the element \((1 << i) - 1\); `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.**
