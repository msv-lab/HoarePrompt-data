Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `arr` is an empty list
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `temp * 2 < k` is false or true respectively
- `temp` is either 1 or `2 * temp` depending on whether `temp * 2 < k` is false or true respectively
- `k0` is equal to `k`
- If `temp * 2 < k`, then `i` is 1 and `temp` is `2 * temp`. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `temp` is 1.

Code Snippet:
```python
temp *= 2
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `temp` is doubled.

Output State:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `l1` remains a list of strings obtained from the input
- `n` remains the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` remains the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `arr` remains an empty list
- `ans` remains an empty list
- `i` remains either 0 or 1 depending on the condition before the code execution (it is not affected by the code snippet)
- `temp` is now `2 * temp` (doubled)
- `k0` remains equal to `k`

Natural Language Description:
The value of `temp` is doubled, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the original `temp * 2 < k` was false or true respectively; `temp` is now `2 * temp`; `k0` is equal to `k`.**
