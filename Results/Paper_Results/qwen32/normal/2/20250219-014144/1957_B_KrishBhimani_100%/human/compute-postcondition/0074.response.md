The code snippet provided sets the variable `temp` to 1. This change impacts only the variable `temp`, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a new list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; if `n` equals 1, the program does not alter `t`, `l1`, `n`, or `k`; otherwise, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, where the first two elements are `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]` and the remaining `n-2` elements are `0`; `i` is 0; `temp` is 1; `k0` is equal to `k`; The input that controls the loop has decremented by 1; `ans` is an empty list.**
