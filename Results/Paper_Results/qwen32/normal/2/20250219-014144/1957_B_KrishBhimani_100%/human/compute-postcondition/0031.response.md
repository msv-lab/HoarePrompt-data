The code appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length equals `n`. 

Given that `ans` initially contains two elements, the number of zeros appended will be `n - len(ans)`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` remains a list of strings; `n` remains the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` remains the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` remains an empty list; `k0` remains equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the elements \((1 << i) - 1\), `k - (1 << i) + 1`, and `n - len(ans)` zeros; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.**
