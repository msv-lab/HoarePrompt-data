The value of `temp` is doubled. Given that `temp * 2` was previously less than `k`, after executing `temp *= 2`, `temp` will now be `2 * temp`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is `2 * temp`.**
