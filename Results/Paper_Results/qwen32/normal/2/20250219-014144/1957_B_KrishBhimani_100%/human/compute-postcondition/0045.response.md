The given code snippet only modifies the value of the variable `temp` by doubling its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `temp * 2 < k` initially, after executing `temp *= 2`, the new value of `temp` will be `2 * temp`, and it will still satisfy the condition `temp * 2 < k` (since `temp` was less than `k/2` before the operation).

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; if `n` equals 1, the program does not alter `t`, `l1`, `n`, or `k`; otherwise, `k0` remains equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `temp` is `2 * temp`; `k0` is equal to `k`. Additionally, `temp * 2 < k`.**
