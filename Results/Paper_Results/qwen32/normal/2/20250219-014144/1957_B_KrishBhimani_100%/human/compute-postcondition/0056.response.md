The given code snippet modifies the value of `temp` by doubling it. Here's the updated state of the variables after executing the code:

- `temp` is now `2 * temp`.
- All other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`, `k0`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions, `temp` was either `1` or `2 * temp` based on the condition `if temp * 2 < k`. After the operation `temp *= 2`, `temp` will be doubled from its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `ans` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `temp` is `2 * temp`; If `temp * 2 < k`, then `i` is 1, otherwise `i` is 0.**
