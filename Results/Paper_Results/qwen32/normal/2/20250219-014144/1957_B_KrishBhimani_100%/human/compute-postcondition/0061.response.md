The given code snippet appends a specific value to the list `ans`. The value being appended is `(1 << i) - 1`, which is equivalent to \(2^i - 1\). This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `i`, `temp`, or `k0`. It only modifies the list `ans`.

Given that `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`, and `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`, the value `(1 << i) - 1` represents a binary number with `i` ones.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `ans` is a list containing one element \((1 << i) - 1\); `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before `temp * 2` became greater than or equal to `k`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `k0` is equal to `k`.**
