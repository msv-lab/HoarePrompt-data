In this case, the `while` loop is defined as `while True:`. This means that the loop condition is always `True`, and the loop will execute at least once regardless of the values of any variables.

Since the loop condition is inherently `True`, there is no need to adjust any variables for the loop to execute the first time. The program state right before the loop can remain exactly as it is.

Therefore, the answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; if `n` equals 1, the program does not alter `t`, `l1`, `n`, or `k`; otherwise, `k0` remains equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `temp` is 1; `k0` is equal to `k`**
