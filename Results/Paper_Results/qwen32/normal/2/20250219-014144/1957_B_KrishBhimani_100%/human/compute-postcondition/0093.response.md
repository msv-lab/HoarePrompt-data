The code snippet appends a value to the list `ans`. Specifically, it calculates `(1 << i) - 1` and adds this value to `ans`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `l1` is a new list of strings obtained from the input
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`
- `arr` is an empty list
- `i` is the maximum value for which `temp * 2 < k` holds true
- `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`
- `k0` is equal to `k`
- The input that controls the loop has decremented by 1
- `ans` is an empty list

After executing the line `ans.append((1 << i) - 1)`, the list `ans` will contain one element, which is `(1 << i) - 1`. This means `ans` is no longer empty but contains this specific calculated value.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a new list of strings obtained from the input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `i` is the maximum value for which `temp * 2 < k` holds true; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `k0` is equal to `k`; The input that controls the loop has decremented by 1; `ans` is a list containing the single element `(1 << i) - 1`.**
