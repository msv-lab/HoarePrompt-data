The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is provided by the input. The initial values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged. Since the new value of `n` is taken from the input, it could be any integer, but it should still satisfy the condition 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500.**
