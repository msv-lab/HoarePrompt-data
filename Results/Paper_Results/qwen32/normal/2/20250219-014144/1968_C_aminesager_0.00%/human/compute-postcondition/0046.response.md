The code snippet `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. 

Given the initial state, `a` is a list with `n` elements where each element is calculated based on the sum of the previous elements of another list `T`. After reversing the list `a`, the order of its elements is flipped.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` is a reversed list with `n` elements where the i-th element (starting from 1) is 1000 minus the sum of the first (i-1) elements of `T`, but now in reverse order; `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in the reversed `a`.**
