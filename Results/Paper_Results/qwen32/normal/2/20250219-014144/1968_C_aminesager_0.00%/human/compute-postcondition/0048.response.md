The given code snippet updates the `result` variable by joining the elements of the list `a` into a space-separated string. The list `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a reversed list with n elements where the i-th element (starting from 1) is 1000 minus the sum of the first (i-1) elements of T, in reverse order; `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in the reversed `a`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `a` retains its original structure and values. The `result` variable now holds a string where each element of `a` is converted to a string and concatenated with spaces in between.
