Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly generate the array `a` such that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`. Let's analyze the code and see why it fails:

### Code Analysis:
1. The program initializes `a` with `[1000]`.
2. It then iterates through the input list `T` (which contains `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`) and appends `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` to `a`.
3. Finally, it reverses the list `a` and prints it.

### Issues:
1. **Initialization of `a[0]`:** The initial value of `a[0]` is set to `1000`, which is arbitrary and may not satisfy the condition `x_2 = a_2 % a_1`.
2. **Calculation of `a[i]`:** The formula `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]` is incorrect. The problem requires `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`, which means `a_i` should be chosen such that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`. The current implementation does not ensure this.
3. **Reversing the List:** Reversing the list `a` at the end is unnecessary and incorrect since the order of elements in `a` matters.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
3
1 1
```
The correct output could be something like `2 3 4` because:
- `3 % 2 = 1`
- `4 % 3 = 1`

However, the provided code will produce:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 - 1 = 999`
- `a[2] = 999 - 1 = 998`
- Reversed `a` would be `[998, 999, 1000]`, which does not satisfy the conditions.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the problem's requirements for generating the array `a`.
