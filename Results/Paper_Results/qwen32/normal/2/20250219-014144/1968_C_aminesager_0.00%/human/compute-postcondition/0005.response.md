The given code snippet takes the input string `line`, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a new list `T`. 

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. The only variable that gets updated is `T`, which is assigned the list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers.**
