Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500.**

Natural Language: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, while `n` and `x` remain unchanged. The new range for `t` is from 0 to 10^4 - 1, given its original range was from 1 to 10^4.
