The given code snippet updates the list `T` by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers. This means that the previous definition of `T` is overwritten.

Given the initial state, `T` was previously defined as a list of integers derived from some input, and `a` and `result` were calculated based on this original `T`. However, after executing the code snippet, `T` is now a new list of integers derived from the newly input string `line`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `i`, and the original `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the newly input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the newly input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list `[1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]), ..., 1000 - (T[0] + T[1]), 1000 - T[0], 1000]`; `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in `a`; `line` is the newly input string; `i` is `n` and `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in `a`.**
