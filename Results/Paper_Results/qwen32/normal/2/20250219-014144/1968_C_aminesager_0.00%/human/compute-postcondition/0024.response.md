To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the existing variables.

Given Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the newly input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500
- `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500
- `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers
- `a` is a list containing the single integer [1000]
- `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`
- `line` is the newly input string

Code Snippet:
```python
a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
```

Here, the code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `a` initially contains one element `[1000]`.
- The new element appended to `a` is `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. Given that `a` initially has only one element, `a[0]` is `1000`. Thus, the new element is `1000 - T[i - 1]`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we assume `i` is a valid index such that `1 ≤ i ≤ len(T)`. For simplicity, let's assume `i` is `1` (the first iteration).

Thus, the new element appended to `a` is `1000 - T[0]`.

Therefore, the updated list `a` will be `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the newly input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500; `x` is a list of `n-1` integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500; `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the input string `line` to integers; `a` is a list `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`; `line` is the newly input string**.
