To determine what will be printed by the `print(op)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand how the variable `op` is defined and used within the context of the code.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive). This likely represents the number of test cases or iterations.
- `n`: An integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive). This could represent the number of elements in a list or array.
- `a`: A list of integers extracted from the string `case`. This list likely contains `n` integers.
- `num`: An integer greater than 0. Its specific role is not clear without more context.
- `num2`: An integer less than or equal to 10,000. Its specific role is also not clear without more context.
- `case`: An input string from which the list `a` is derived.
- `op`: The number of times a loop has run. This is the variable we are interested in printing.
- `b`: A sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median` is greater than `median`.
- `median`: Initially set to `median_initial`.
- `new_median`: Initially set to `median_initial + 1`.

### Analysis:

The variable `op` is described as "the number of times the loop ran." To determine the exact value of `op`, we would need to know the specific loop in question and how many times it iterates. However, based on the given information, we can infer that `op` is a counter that increments each time the loop's condition is met.

Without the actual loop code, we cannot determine the exact number of iterations. However, we can describe `op` in terms of the loop's behavior.

### Conclusion:

Given the initial state, `op` is the count of loop iterations. Since the exact loop is not provided, we can only describe `op` as the number of times the loop ran based on the conditions specified in the loop.

Output: **op (where op is the number of times the loop ran)**
