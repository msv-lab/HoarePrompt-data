The code snippet assigns the value of `median` to `new_median`. This means that `new_median` will now hold the same value as `median`.

Given the initial state, `new_median` was initially set to `median_initial + 1`. After executing the code, `new_median` is updated to be exactly `median`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers parsed from `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `op` is 0, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is `b[ma]`, `new_median` is `median`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**
