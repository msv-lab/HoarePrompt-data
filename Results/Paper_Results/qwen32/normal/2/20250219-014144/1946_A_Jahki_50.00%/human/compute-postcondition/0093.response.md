To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop condition. The loop condition is:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that for the loop to continue executing, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`
- `num` is greater than 0
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is the new input string
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `op` is 2
- `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 2
- `median` is `b[ma] + 1`
- `new_median` is `b[ma]`
- `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`

We need to ensure that `new_median <= median` holds true. From the given state:
- `median` is `b[ma] + 1`
- `new_median` is `b[ma]`

Since `new_median` is `b[ma]` and `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, it is clear that `new_median` is always less than `median` under these conditions. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to satisfy the loop condition.

Thus, the state remains unchanged for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers parsed from the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `op` is 2, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 2, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, and `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**
