To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop increments the middle element (`b[ma]`) of the sorted list `b` until the new median (`new_median`) is greater than the old median (`median`). 

From the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
- After each iteration, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1.
- The variable `op` (which counts the number of operations) increases by 1 with each iteration.
- The `median` remains constant until `new_median` exceeds it, at which point the loop terminates.

Since the loop continues until `new_median` is greater than `median`, the loop will run exactly until `b[ma]` is incremented enough to make `new_median` greater than `median`.

Let's denote the initial median as `median_initial`. The loop will increment `b[ma]` until `b[ma] > median_initial`. Since `b` is sorted and `ma` points to the middle element, the number of increments required will depend on how many elements in `b` are equal to `median_initial`.

However, the exact number of iterations is not specified in the problem statement, so we assume the loop runs until `b[ma]` is just greater than `median_initial`. This means `b[ma]` will be `median_initial + 1` after the loop terminates.

Therefore, the final output state is:
- `op` will be the number of increments made to `b[ma]`, which is the number of times the loop ran.
- `b` will be the sorted list with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median` is greater than `median`.
- `median` will remain the same as `median_initial` until the loop terminates.
- `new_median` will be `median_initial + 1`.

Given the pattern observed in the first three iterations, the final state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is the number of times the loop ran, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented until `new_median` is greater than `median`, `median` is `median_initial`, `new_median` is `median_initial + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will keep increasing the middle element of the sorted list until it becomes greater than the initial median, and the number of increments will be recorded in `op`. The final median value (`new_median`) will be one more than the initial median (`median`).
