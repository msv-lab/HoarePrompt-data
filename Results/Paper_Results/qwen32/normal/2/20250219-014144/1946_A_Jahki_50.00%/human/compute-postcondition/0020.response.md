The code increments the value at index `ma` in the list `b` by 1. Given that `median` is `b[ma]`, incrementing `b[ma]` means `median` also increases by 1. The new value of `median` will be `median + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, `median` is `median + 1`, `new_median` is greater than `median`**.
