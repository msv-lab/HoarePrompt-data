The code snippet assigns the integer division of `num2` by 2 to the variable `ma`. This means `ma` will take the value of `num2 // 2`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ma`, which is now set to `int(num2 / 2)`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers parsed from `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `op` is 0, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is `median_initial`, `new_median` is `median_initial + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**.
