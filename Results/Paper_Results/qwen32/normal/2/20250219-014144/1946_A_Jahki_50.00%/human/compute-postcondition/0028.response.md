The code snippet `new_median = b[ma]` assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Given that `b[ma]` was previously calculated as `median + 1` and `new_median` was also set to `b[ma]` before this line, the value of `new_median` remains unchanged after this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 2, `median` is `median + 1`, `new_median` is `b[ma]` which is now `b[ma] + 1`.**
