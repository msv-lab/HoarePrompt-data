The given code snippet sorts the list `a` and assigns the sorted list to `b`. This means that the order of elements in `b` will now reflect the sorted order of the elements in `a`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers parsed from `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `op` is 0, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is `median_initial`, and `new_median` is `median_initial + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
