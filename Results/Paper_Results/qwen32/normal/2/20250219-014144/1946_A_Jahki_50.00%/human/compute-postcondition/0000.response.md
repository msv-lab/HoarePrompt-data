Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `num` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is set to the integer value of the input. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
