To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition. In this case, the loop condition is:

```python
while new_median <= median:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means that for the loop to execute again, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`
- `num` is greater than 0
- `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 2
- `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 2
- `median` is `median + 1`
- `new_median` is `b[ma]` which is now `b[ma] + 1`

We need to adjust `new_median` and/or `median` so that the condition `new_median <= median` holds true.

Since `new_median` is defined as `b[ma] + 1` and `median` is `median + 1`, we can infer that `new_median` is currently equal to `median`. To ensure the loop executes again, we need to make sure that `new_median` remains less than or equal to `median`. One way to achieve this is to decrease `median` by 1, making `median` greater than `new_median`.

Therefore, the adjustment required is to decrement `median` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is 2, `b` is the sorted list of integers from `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 2, `median` is `median`, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 1`** (where `median` is decremented by 1 from its current value)
