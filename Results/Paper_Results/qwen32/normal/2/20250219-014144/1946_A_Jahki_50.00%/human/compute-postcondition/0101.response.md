To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the outputs after the first three iterations.

Here's a summary of the loop's behavior:
- The loop runs `num` times.
- For each iteration, it reads `num2` and `case`.
- If `num2` is greater than 10000, it prints `1` and `16668` and breaks out of the loop.
- Otherwise, it processes the list `a` derived from `case`, finds the median, and increments the median until it becomes greater than its initial value, counting the number of increments (`op`).

Given the outputs after the first three iterations:
1. After the first iteration, `op` is the number of increments required to make the median greater than its initial value.
2. After the second iteration, `op` is again the number of increments required for the new list.
3. After the third iteration, `op` is once more the number of increments required for the latest list.

Since the loop runs `num` times, the final output state will reflect the processing of all `num` inputs. Each iteration independently calculates and prints the number of operations (`op`) required to increment the median of the list derived from `case` until it exceeds its initial value.

Thus, the final output state will consist of `num` lines, each containing the number of operations (`op`) for the respective iteration.

Output State: **The loop will print `num` lines, each containing the number of operations (`op`) required to increment the median of the list derived from `case` until it exceeds its initial value for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the output will be a series of numbers, each representing how many times the median of the respective list had to be incremented to become greater than its initial value.
