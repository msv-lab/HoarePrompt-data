To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `h`.

Given the loop:
```python
for h in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500
- `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6
- `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9
- `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`
- `li` is a list containing two elements `a + k * c + d * h` and `a + k * c + d`
- `h` is 1

Since `h` is the variable in the loop head, it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `h` should be 2 (since it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration).

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `li`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing two elements `a + k * c + d * h` and `a + k * c + d`, `h` is 2**
