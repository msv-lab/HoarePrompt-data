### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if a given list of integers can form a specific type of matrix called a "progressive square." The progressive square is defined by its size \( n \), and two integers \( c \) and \( d \). The matrix is constructed such that the element at position \((i, j)\) in the matrix is calculated as \( a_{1,1} + i \cdot c + j \cdot d \), where \( a_{1,1} \) is the smallest element in the list.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three integers \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \), followed by a list of \( n^2 \) integers.

2. **Determine \( a_{1,1} \)**: For each test case, the program finds the minimum value in the list, which is assumed to be \( a_{1,1} \).

3. **Generate Progressive Square Elements**: Using \( a_{1,1} \), \( c \), and \( d \), the program generates a list of \( n^2 \) elements that would form the progressive square. This is done using nested loops where the element at position \((i, j)\) is calculated as \( a_{1,1} + i \cdot c + j \cdot d \).

4. **Sorting and Comparison**: Both the generated list and the input list are sorted. If they match, it means the input list can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and the program outputs "YES". Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases by ensuring that the lists are compared after sorting, which accounts for the fact that the input list might not be in any particular order.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correctly implemented. The program correctly identifies whether the given list can form the specified progressive square by comparing the sorted versions of the generated list and the input list.
