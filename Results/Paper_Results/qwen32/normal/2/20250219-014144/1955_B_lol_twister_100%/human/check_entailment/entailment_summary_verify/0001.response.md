### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- A progressive square of size \( n \times n \) is constructed using the rules:
  - The top-left element is \( a_{1,1} \).
  - Each element in the \( i \)-th row and \( j \)-th column is calculated as \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \).

- Given \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and a list of \( n^2 \) integers, determine if the list can be rearranged to form such a progressive square.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and the list of \( n^2 \) integers.

2. **Finding \( a_{1,1} \)**:
   - The program finds the minimum value in the list \( l \) and assigns it to \( a \). This is a reasonable assumption because \( a_{1,1} \) should be the smallest element in the progressive square.

3. **Generating Progressive Square**:
   - The program generates the expected elements of the progressive square using the formula \( a_{i,j} = a + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \).
   - It stores these elements in a list \( li \).

4. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - Both the generated list \( li \) and the input list \( l \) are sorted.
   - If they match, it means the input list can be rearranged to form the progressive square, and the program returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`.
- It checks if the list `l` can be rearranged into a specific sequence generated by starting from the minimum value in `l` and incrementing by `c` and `d` in a structured manner.
- If `l` matches this sequence when both are sorted, the function returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Finding \( a_{1,1} \)**:
  - The assumption that the minimum value in the list is \( a_{1,1} \) is correct because \( a_{1,1} \) is indeed the smallest element in the progressive square.

- **Generating Progressive Square**:
  - The nested loops correctly generate the elements of the progressive square based on the given formula:
    \[
    a_{i,j} = a + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d
    \]
  - This formula is consistent with the problem description.

- **Sorting and Comparison**:
  - Sorting both lists and comparing them ensures that the input list can be rearranged to match the progressive square, regardless of the initial order of elements.
  - This approach is valid because the order of elements in the progressive square does not matter; only the set of elements matters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list can be rearranged to form the progressive square based on the provided rules. The original assessment is accurate.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
