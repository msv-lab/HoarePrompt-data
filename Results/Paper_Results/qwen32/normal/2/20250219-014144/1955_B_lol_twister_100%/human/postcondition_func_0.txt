The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (the size of a matrix), `c` and `d` (integers), and `l` (a list of `n^2` integers representing the elements of the matrix). It checks if the list `l` can be rearranged into a specific sequence generated by starting from the minimum value in `l` and incrementing by `c` and `d` in a structured manner. If `l` matches this sequence when both are sorted, the function returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.
