To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the list `li`.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs from `h = 0` to `h = n - 1`.
- In each iteration, the element `a + (n-1) * c + d * h` is appended to the list `li`.

### Initial Setup:
- Initially, `li` contains `n^2` elements: `[a + 0 * c, a + 0 * c + d, a + 0 * c + 2 * d, ..., a + (n-1) * c + (n-1) * d]`.

### Iterations:
- After the first iteration (`h = 0`), `li` has `n^2 + 1` elements.
- After the second iteration (`h = 1`), `li` has `n^2 + 2` elements.
- After the third iteration (`h = 2`), `li` has `n^2 + 3` elements.

Following this pattern, after the loop completes all `n` iterations, `li` will have `n^2 + n` elements.

### Final List `li`:
- The list `li` will contain the original `n^2` elements plus `n` additional elements.
- These `n` additional elements are: `[a + (n-1) * c + d * 0, a + (n-1) * c + d * 1, a + (n-1) * c + d * 2, ..., a + (n-1) * c + d * (n-1)]`.

### Final Output State:
- The variable `h` will be `n-1` after the last iteration.
- The variable `k` remains `n-1` throughout the loop.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\), `c` and `d` are integers such that \(1 \leq c, d \leq 10^6\), `l` is a list of \(n^2\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing \(n^2 + n\) elements `[a + 0 * c, a + 0 * c + d, a + 0 * c + 2 * d, ..., a + (n-1) * c + (n-1) * d, a + (n-1) * c + d * 0, a + (n-1) * c + d * 1, a + (n-1) * c + d * 2, ..., a + (n-1) * c + d * (n-1)]`, `k` is `n-1`, `h` is `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the list `li` will have `n^2 + n` elements, with the last `n` elements being a sequence starting from `a + (n-1) * c` and increasing by `d` each step.
