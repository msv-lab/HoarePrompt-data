To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which is `k` in this case. The loop iterates over `k` from `0` to `n-1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\)
- `c` and `d` are integers such that \(1 \leq c, d \leq 10^6\)
- `l` is a list of \(n^2\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\)
- `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`
- `li` is a list containing `n` elements \([a + k \cdot c, a + k \cdot c + d, a + k \cdot c + 2 \cdot d, \ldots, a + k \cdot c + (n-1) \cdot d]\)

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` would have taken on some value from `0` to `n-2` (since the loop runs until `k` reaches `n-1`). For the next iteration, `k` should be incremented by 1.

Let's denote the value of `k` at the end of the previous iteration as `k_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be `k_prev + 1`.

Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, and `li`) do not change based on the loop head variable `k`, they remain the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\); `c` and `d` are integers such that \(1 \leq c, d \leq 10^6\); `l` is a list of \(n^2\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\); `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a list containing `n` elements \([a + k \cdot c, a + k \cdot c + d, a + k \cdot c + 2 \cdot d, \ldots, a + k \cdot c + (n-1) \cdot d]\); `k` is `k_prev + 1` where `k_prev` is the value of `k` at the end of the previous iteration.**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `k_prev`, we can generalize it as `k` being incremented by 1 from its previous value:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\); `c` and `d` are integers such that \(1 \leq c, d \leq 10^6\); `l` is a list of \(n^2\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\); `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a list containing `n` elements \([a + k \cdot c, a + k \cdot c + d, a + k \cdot c + 2 \cdot d, \ldots, a + k \cdot c + (n-1) \cdot d]\); `k` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

For clarity, if we assume the previous value of `k` was `x`, then the new value of `k` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\); `c` and `d` are integers such that \(1 \leq c, d \leq 10^6\); `l` is a list of \(n^2\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\); `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a list containing `n` elements \([a + k \cdot c, a + k \cdot c + d, a + k \cdot c + 2 \cdot d, \ldots, a + k \cdot c + (n-1) \cdot d]\); `k` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `k` at the end of the previous iteration.**

So, if `k` was 0 at the end of the first iteration, it will be 1 at the start of the second iteration, and so on.

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\); `c` and `d` are integers such that \(1 \leq c, d \leq 10^6\); `l` is a list of \(n^2\) integers where each integer \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\); `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`; `li` is a list containing `n` elements \([a + k \cdot c, a + k \cdot c + d, a + k \cdot c + 2 \cdot d, \ldots, a + k \cdot c + (n-1) \cdot d]\); `k` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `k` at the end of the previous iteration.**
