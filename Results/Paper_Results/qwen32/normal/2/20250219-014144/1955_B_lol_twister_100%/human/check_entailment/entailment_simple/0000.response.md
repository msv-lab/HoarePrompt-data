### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if a given list of integers can form a specific type of matrix called a "progressive square." The progressive square is constructed based on the parameters \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \) using the formula \( a_{i,j} = a + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \), where \( a \) is the smallest integer in the list.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the integers \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \), followed by a list of \( n^2 \) integers.
3. **Finding Minimum Value**: It finds the minimum value \( a \) in the list.
4. **Generating Progressive Square**: It generates the expected elements of the progressive square using the formula \( a + i \cdot c + j \cdot d \) for \( i, j \) ranging from 0 to \( n-1 \).
5. **Sorting and Comparison**: It sorts both the generated list and the input list and compares them. If they match, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

The logic of the program aligns with the problem description. The progressive square is uniquely determined by the parameters \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \), and the minimum value \( a \) in the list. By generating the expected values and comparing them with the input values, the program correctly determines whether the input list can form the specified progressive square.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
