The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, which iterates over each character in the `expression` string. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `char` to reflect the next character in the `expression` string.

Given that `char` is the next character in the `expression` string at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` should be updated to the subsequent character in the `expression`.

Let's denote the current position of `char` in the `expression` as `position`. At the end of the previous iteration, `position` would be such that `char` is `expression[position]`. For the next iteration, `position` should be incremented by 1, and `char` should be set to `expression[position + 1]`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `position` or the specific characters in `expression`, we can describe the state in terms of the next character.

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (where 1 <= `length` <= 5000) consisting of characters '+' and '-', `char` is the next character in the `expression` string after the current `char`. If `char` is '+', `count` is increased by 1.**

To be more precise, if `char` was the character at index `i` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `char` should be the character at index `i + 1`.

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (where 1 <= `length` <= 5000) consisting of characters '+' and '-', `char` is the character at the next position in the `expression` string. If `char` is '+', `count` is increased by 1.**

Since we are only concerned with adjusting the state of `char` for the next iteration:

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (where 1 <= `length` <= 5000) consisting of characters '+' and '-', `char` is the next character in the `expression` string.**
