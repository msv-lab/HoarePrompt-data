In the given task, the for loop iterates over each character in the string `expression`. The loop head involves the variable `char` and the iterable `expression`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to consider the following:

1. **`expression`**: This is the iterable in the loop. For the loop to execute, `expression` must be a non-empty string since the loop iterates over each character in this string.

2. **`char`**: This variable represents each character in the string `expression` during each iteration. However, `char` is not something we can directly set before the loop starts because it gets its value from the elements of `expression` during each iteration.

Given that `expression` is described as a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-', and `length` is an integer such that 1 <= `length` <= 5000, we need to ensure that `expression` is indeed a non-empty string.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should confirm that `expression` is a valid string with at least one character.

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (where 1 <= `length` <= 5000) consisting of characters '+' and '-', `count` is 0**
