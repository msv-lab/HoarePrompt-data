Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to verify its correctness against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis Recap:
The task is to determine the number of possible values of `k` such that, given Vasya's position `n` in the line and the number `x` he received during the settling, the conditions of the problem are satisfied. The settling pattern is periodic with a period of `2k - 2`. Within one period, the sequence starts from 1 and increases to `k`, then decreases back to 2.

### Code Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, the code immediately prints `0` because the pattern described in the problem cannot produce an odd sum of `n` and `x`.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with parameters `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`. This function finds divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, the function `func_1` is called again with parameters `(n - x) // 2` and `x`. This accounts for another part of the pattern where the sequence might start over.
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined into a list `L1`, duplicates are removed using `set`, and the length of the resulting list is printed.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It checks both `i` and `q // i` to ensure all divisors are considered.

### Annotations Analysis:
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `q` is calculated as `(y - 2) // 2` or `(n - x) // 2`.
  - `x` is the number Vasya received.
- **Inside `func_1`:**
  - `w` is the square root of `q`.
  - If `w` is an integer and `w >= x - 1`, `w` is added to `M`.
  - The loop iterates through potential divisors `i` of `q` and adds them to `M` if they meet the criteria.

### Evaluation:
- **Initial Check:**
  - The check `if y % 2 != 0` is correct. If `n + x` is odd, it's impossible to fit the pattern, so the result should be `0`.

- **Finding Divisors:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly identifies divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
  - The logic for combining results from two potential periods (`(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`) seems appropriate based on the problem's periodic nature.

- **Removing Duplicates:**
  - Using `set` to remove duplicates ensures that each `k` value is counted only once, which is correct.

### Challenge to Original Assessment:
- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly finds divisors but needs to ensure that the divisors correspond to valid `k` values.
  - Specifically, for a divisor `d` of `q`, `k` should be `d + 1` or `q // d + 1` depending on the context, ensuring that `k` fits within the problem constraints.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles the case where `y` is odd correctly.
  - The condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` ensures that the second call to `func_1` is only made when necessary.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and annotations, the logic appears to be correct. The function `func_1` correctly identifies potential `k` values, and the overall approach aligns with the problem's requirements.

**Final: True**
