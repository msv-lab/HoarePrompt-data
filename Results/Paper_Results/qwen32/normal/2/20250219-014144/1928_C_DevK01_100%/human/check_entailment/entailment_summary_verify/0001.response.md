### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the code and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
The problem requires finding the number of possible values of `k` such that, given Vasya's position `n` in the line and the number `x` he received during the settling, the conditions of the problem are satisfied. The settling pattern is periodic with a period of `2k - 2`. Within one period, the sequence starts from 1 and increases to `k`, then decreases back to 2.

#### Code Analysis Recap:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, the code immediately prints `0` because the pattern described in the problem cannot produce an odd sum of `n` and `x`.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with parameters `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`. This function finds divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, the function `func_1` is called again with parameters `(n - x) // 2` and `x`. This accounts for another part of the pattern where the sequence might start over.
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined into a list `L1`, duplicates are removed using `set`, and the length of the resulting list is printed.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It checks both `i` and `q // i` to ensure all divisors are considered.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Initial Check (`y % 2 != 0`):**
  - This check is correct. If `n + x` is odd, the sequence cannot fit the described pattern, and the result should be `0`.

- **Finding Divisors:**
  - The function `func_1` is supposed to find divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. However, the function summary provided has a discrepancy. The function summary incorrectly states that `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `(n, x)`, but in the code, `func_1` is called with a single integer `q` and an integer `x`.

- **Combining Results:**
  - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined, and duplicates are removed using `set`. This is correct to ensure each `k` value is counted only once.

- **Logic for Determining `k`:**
  - The logic for determining `k` is based on the periodicity of the sequence. The code considers two cases:
    1. `k` derived from `(y - 2) // 2`.
    2. `k` derived from `(n - x) // 2` if `n >= 3 * x - 2`.

Given the problem description and the code, the logic appears to be correct. However, the function summary provided does not accurately describe the actual behavior of `func_1`. The function summary should be corrected to reflect that `func_1` takes a single integer `q` and an integer `x`, not a list of tuples.

### Conclusion:
Despite the discrepancy in the function summary, the code itself appears to correctly implement the solution based on the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
