The given code attempts to calculate the square root of the list `q` using `math.sqrt(q)`. However, `math.sqrt()` expects a single numeric argument, not a list of tuples. This will result in a `TypeError`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the error, the code does not successfully execute as intended, and no changes are made to the variables `q` and `M`. The variable `w` is not properly defined due to the error.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **q is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The length of q is between 1 and 100, inclusive; M is an empty list.**
