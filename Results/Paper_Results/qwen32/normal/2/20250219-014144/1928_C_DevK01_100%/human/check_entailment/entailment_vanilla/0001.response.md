Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the number of possible values of `k` such that, given Vasya's position `n` in the line and the number `x` he received during the settling, the conditions of the problem are satisfied.

The settling pattern is periodic with a period of `2k - 2`. Within one period, the sequence starts from 1 and increases to `k`, then decreases back to 2. We need to determine how many different `k` values can produce the number `x` at position `n`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, the code immediately prints `0` because the pattern described in the problem cannot produce an odd sum of `n` and `x`.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with parameters `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`. This function finds divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, the function `func_1` is called again with parameters `(n - x) // 2` and `x`. This accounts for another part of the pattern where the sequence might start over.
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined into a list `L1`, duplicates are removed using `set`, and the length of the resulting list is printed.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It checks both `i` and `q // i` to ensure all divisors are considered.

### Evaluation:
- The logic seems to correctly identify potential `k` values by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequence and checking divisors.
- The initial check for `y % 2 != 0` is correct because the sum `n + x` must be even for the sequence to fit the described pattern.
- The use of `set` to remove duplicates ensures that each `k` value is counted only once.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution based on the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
