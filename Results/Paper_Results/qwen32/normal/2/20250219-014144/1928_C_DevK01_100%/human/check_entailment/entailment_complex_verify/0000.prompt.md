You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The length of q is between 1 and 100, inclusive.

    #State: q is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The length of q is between 1 and 100, inclusive. If w is an integer such that w is equal to its integer division by 1 and w is greater than or equal to x - 1, then M is a list containing the single element w. Otherwise, M remains an empty list.

    #State: `M` contains all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotients if they are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`. `i` is equal to the length of `q`.
    return M
    #The program returns `M`, which contains all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` along with their corresponding quotients if those quotients are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `q` where each tuple contains two integers `(n, x)` representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\). It also accepts an integer `x`. The function returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `n` from each tuple in `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with their corresponding quotients if those quotients are also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are some specific cases and logical errors:

1. **Function `func_1` and its usage**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. However, the function does not handle all possible cases correctly.
   - The function checks if `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and adds it to the list `M` if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. It also checks divisors `i` and `q // i` but does not ensure that both are added correctly without duplicates.
   - The function does not handle the case where `q` is less than `x - 1` properly, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Logic for calculating `L1`**:
   - The program calculates `L1` using `func_1` for `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`, and then potentially adds more values from `func_1` for `(n - x) // 2` and `x` if `n >= 3 * x - 2`.
   - The logic for combining results from `func_1` is not clearly defined and may lead to incorrect results, especially when considering edge cases.

3. **Handling of edge cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `x` is very close to `n` or when `n` is very large.
   - The program does not correctly account for the periodic nature of the sequence described in the problem, which repeats every `2k - 2` positions.

4. **Incorrect handling of `k` values**:
   - The program does not correctly determine the valid `k` values that fit the given constraints. It relies on the results from `func_1` without ensuring that the calculated `k` values are valid for the given `n` and `x`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
10 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
```

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not correctly identify all valid `k` values for the given `n` and `x`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to these issues and does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
