The code appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. The values of `q`, `i`, and `w` remain unchanged except for `M` which now includes the new element `i`.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(n, x)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `w` must be at least `i + 1`, `M` now includes the value of `i`.**
