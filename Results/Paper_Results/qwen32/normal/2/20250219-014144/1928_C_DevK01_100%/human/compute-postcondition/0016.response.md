To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition and the variables involved in it. The loop condition is `i < w`, meaning the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `w`.

Given the provided state:
- `q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(n, x)`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- `w` is not explicitly mentioned in the state but is used in the loop condition.

Since the only variable in the loop condition is `i` and `w`, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `w` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` and possibly `w` if necessary.

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Current State**: `i` has some value, and `w` has some value.
2. **Loop Condition**: `i < w`.
3. **Adjustments Needed**: To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be less than `w`. If `i` is already equal to or greater than `w`, we need to increase `w` or decrease `i`.

### Possible Adjustments:
- If `i` is less than `w`, no adjustment is needed.
- If `i` is equal to or greater than `w`, we need to increase `w` by at least 1 to ensure `i < w`.

### Conclusion:
Since we don't know the exact values of `i` and `w`, we need to ensure that the condition `i < w` holds true. The simplest way to guarantee this is to ensure that `w` is at least `i + 1`.

State: **`q` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(n, x)`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `w` must be at least `i + 1`**.
