Postcondition: **q is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (n, x) representing Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling, respectively, with the constraints 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The length of q is between 1 and 100, inclusive; M is an empty list. Additionally, w is an integer such that w is equal to its integer division by 1 and w is greater than or equal to x - 1.**
