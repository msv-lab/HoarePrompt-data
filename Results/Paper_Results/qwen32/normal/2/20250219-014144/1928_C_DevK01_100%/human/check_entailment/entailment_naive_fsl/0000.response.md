Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are some specific cases and logical errors:

1. **Function `func_1` and its usage**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. However, the function does not handle all possible cases correctly.
   - The function checks if `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and adds it to the list `M` if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. It also checks divisors `i` and `q // i` but does not ensure that both are added correctly without duplicates.
   - The function does not handle the case where `q` is less than `x - 1` properly, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Logic for calculating `L1`**:
   - The program calculates `L1` using `func_1` for `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`, and then potentially adds more values from `func_1` for `(n - x) // 2` and `x` if `n >= 3 * x - 2`.
   - The logic for combining results from `func_1` is not clearly defined and may lead to incorrect results, especially when considering edge cases.

3. **Handling of edge cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `x` is very close to `n` or when `n` is very large.
   - The program does not correctly account for the periodic nature of the sequence described in the problem, which repeats every `2k - 2` positions.

4. **Incorrect handling of `k` values**:
   - The program does not correctly determine the valid `k` values that fit the given constraints. It relies on the results from `func_1` without ensuring that the calculated `k` values are valid for the given `n` and `x`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
10 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
```

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not correctly identify all valid `k` values for the given `n` and `x`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to these issues and does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
