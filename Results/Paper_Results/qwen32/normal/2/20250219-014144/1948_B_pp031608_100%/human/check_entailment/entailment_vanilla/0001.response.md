Let's analyze the provided Python program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Task:**
   - We need to check if it's possible to sort an array `a` by repeatedly splitting numbers that are at least 10 into their constituent digits.
   - The operation can be performed any number of times, including zero times.

2. **Approach of the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself.
   - It initializes a flag `ans` to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted.
   - It iterates over the array from the end to the beginning (from index `m-1` to `1`).
     - If it finds an element that is smaller than the previous one (`arr[i] < arr[i-1]`), it attempts to resolve this by splitting the larger number (`arr[i-1]`) into its digits and checking if the resulting list (including the smaller number) can be sorted.
     - If the resulting list cannot be sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If the resulting list can be sorted, it updates `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number.
   - Finally, it prints "YES" if `ans` is still `True`, otherwise "NO".

3. **Issues with the Provided Program:**
   - The approach does not correctly handle the transformation of the array. Splitting a number and checking if the resulting list can be sorted does not guarantee that the entire array can be sorted through repeated operations.
   - The logic of updating `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number is flawed because it doesn't account for the correct placement of the digits in the array.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of splitting multiple numbers and reordering them to achieve a sorted array.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted through the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness:** **False**
