The code snippet provided creates a new list `nums` by taking the digits of the integer at index `i-1` in the list `arr` and appending the integer at index `i` in the list `arr`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the code will take the digits of `arr[0]` and append `arr[1]` to form the list `nums`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `nums` is created as a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Given these points, the Output State can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer such that m ≥ 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `i` is 1; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`.**
