To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
```

This means the loop variable `i` starts from `m - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.
- `m` is an input integer such that m ≥ 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
- `i` is 2.

Since `i` is currently 2, we need to adjust `i` to the value it would have at the start of the next iteration. The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, so the next value of `i` should be `i - 1`.

Therefore, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration would be `1`.

No other variables in the loop head (`m`) need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer such that m ≥ 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `i` is 1.**
