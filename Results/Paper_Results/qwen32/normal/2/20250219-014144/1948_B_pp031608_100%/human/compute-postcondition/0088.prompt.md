Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = True
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
            if nums != sorted(nums):
                ans = False
                break
            arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
    print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers potentially modified based on the conditions inside the loop; `ans` is False if any `nums` formed during the loop is not sorted, otherwise `ans` is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, possibly modified; `ans` is either True or False depending on whether any `nums` list was unsorted.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, potentially modified if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `nums` is sorted; `ans` is True if all `nums` formed during the loop iterations were sorted, otherwise `ans` is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
