Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if it's possible to sort the array using the described operations. The logic for checking if the array can be sorted is flawed. Specifically, the program checks if splitting a number and placing its digits in front of the next number results in a sorted sequence, but this doesn't guarantee that the entire array can be sorted through the allowed operations.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
1
4
12 3 21 4
```

The correct output should be `NO`, because there is no way to sort this array using the allowed operations. However, the provided program might incorrectly output `YES`.

A more robust approach would involve simulating the operations and checking if a sorted sequence can be achieved, which the current program does not do accurately.
