The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the value of `n` changes based on the input provided, while the other variables (`t` and `a`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.

After executing the code snippet, `n` will take on the value of the integer input. Therefore, the new value of `n` will be whatever integer is provided by the user input, and it will replace the previous value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.**
