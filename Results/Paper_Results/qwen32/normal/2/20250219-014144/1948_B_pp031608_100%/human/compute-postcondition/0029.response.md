To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This represents the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer input by the user, where \(2 \leq n \leq 50\). This represents the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 99\).
- `m` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers potentially modified based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `ans` is a boolean variable that is set to `False` if any `nums` formed during the loop is not sorted, otherwise it is set to `True`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Explanation:
The code snippet uses a list indexing trick to print either "NO" or "YES" based on the value of `ans`. Specifically:
- If `ans` is `False`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][0]`, which is `"NO"`.
- If `ans` is `True`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][1]`, which is `"YES"`.

### Determining `ans`:
The value of `ans` depends on the logic inside the loop that modifies `arr` and checks if `nums` (which is presumably derived from `arr`) is sorted. Since the specific logic inside the loop is not provided, we can only infer the following:
- If any `nums` formed during the loop is not sorted, `ans` will be `False`.
- If all `nums` formed during the loop are sorted, `ans` will be `True`.

### Conclusion:
Without the specific logic inside the loop, we cannot definitively say whether `ans` will be `True` or `False`. However, based on the given information, the output will be either "NO" or "YES" depending on the value of `ans`.

### Final Output:
Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans] (where ans is True if all nums formed during the loop are sorted, otherwise False)**

However, to match the requested format more precisely:
Output: **'NO' if ans is False, otherwise 'YES'**
