The code snippet provided is `m = int(input())`. This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `m`. The values of all other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, possibly modified; `ans` is either True or False depending on whether any `nums` list was unsorted**.
