Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` is the integer input by the user, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99; `m` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0]` is now equal to `nums[0]` if `arr[1] < arr[0]`, otherwise `arr` remains unchanged; `i` is 1; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]` if `arr[1] < arr[0]`, otherwise `nums` is not defined; `ans` is False if `arr[1] < arr[0]` and `nums` is not sorted, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**
