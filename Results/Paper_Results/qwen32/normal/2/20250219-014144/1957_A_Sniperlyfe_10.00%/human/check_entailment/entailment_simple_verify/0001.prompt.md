You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the stick lengths.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `freq` is a dictionary containing the counts of each unique stick length found in `arr` (excluding the first element which is the number of test cases).
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer divisions of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 4.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks, where each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick, and no stick can be reused across different polygons. Regular polygons can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3.

### Key Points

- A regular polygon requires at least 3 sticks of the same length.
- The number of polygons that can be formed from sticks of a particular length `l` is given by `freq[l] // 3`, where `freq[l]` is the frequency of sticks of length `l`.
- However, the provided code incorrectly uses `freq[l] // 4` instead of `freq[l] // 3`.

### Code Analysis

The provided code does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reads the number of sticks and their lengths.
3. Calls the function `func_1` with the list of stick lengths.
4. Inside `func_1`, it calculates the frequency of each stick length.
5. It then sums up the number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 (integer division).

### Issues in the Code

The critical issue with the code is the incorrect divisor used in the calculation of the number of polygons. Since a regular polygon can be formed with 3 or more sticks of the same length, the correct divisor should be 3, not 4.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect divisor (4 instead of 3) in the calculation of the number of polygons that can be formed from sticks of the same length.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
