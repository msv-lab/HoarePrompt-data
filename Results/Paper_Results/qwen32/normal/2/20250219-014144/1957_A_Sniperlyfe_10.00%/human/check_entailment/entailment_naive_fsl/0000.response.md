Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed. The function `func_1` only considers the number of sides required for a square (i.e., 4 sides), which means it will not account for other regular polygons like triangles (3 sides), pentagons (5 sides), etc. This is evident from the line `return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))`, which assumes that only squares can be formed.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6
3 3 3 3 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation:
We can form a regular hexagon (6 sides) using all six sticks of length 3. However, the provided program will output `0` because it only checks for the possibility of forming squares (4 sides).

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all possible regular polygons.
