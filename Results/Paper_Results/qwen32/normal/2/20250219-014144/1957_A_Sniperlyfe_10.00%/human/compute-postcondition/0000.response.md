Output State: **arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the stick lengths; freq is an empty dictionary.**

Natural Language: The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged as it is a list of integers where the first element indicates the number of test cases, and each subsequent segment of the list represents a test case with its corresponding stick lengths. The new variable `freq` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
