The code increments the count of `n` in the `freq` dictionary by 1. If `n` was not already a key in `freq`, it initializes the count to 1. The values of `arr`, `t`, and the other elements in `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, `n` is the next element in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `n` incremented by 1.**
