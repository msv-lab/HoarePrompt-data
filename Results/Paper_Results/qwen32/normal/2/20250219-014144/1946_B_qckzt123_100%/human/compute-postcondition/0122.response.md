To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve with each iteration. Let's break down the loop and its effects on the variables.

### Loop Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is initialized to some integer value between 1 and 10^4.
   - `T` is the total number of iterations, read from the input.

2. **Loop Body**:
   - For each iteration, `n` and `k` are read as integers.
   - A list `a` of `n` integers is read.
   - `s` is calculated as the sum of the elements in `a`.
   - `t` and `tmp` are reset to 0.
   - The inner loop calculates the maximum cumulative sum of non-negative subarrays in `a`, updating `t` accordingly.
   - `ans` is calculated using the formula `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.
   - For `k-1` iterations, `t` is doubled and added to `ans`, with all operations modulo `MOD`.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After processing each test case, the result `ans` is printed.

### Output State Evolution:

- **After 1st Iteration**:
  - `t` is updated to `(t * 2^(k-1)) % MOD`.
  - `ans` is calculated based on the current values of `s`, `t`, and the doubling process.

- **After 2nd Iteration**:
  - `t` is again updated to `(t * 2^(k-1)) % MOD` based on the new `t` from the previous iteration.
  - `ans` is recalculated similarly.

- **After 3rd Iteration**:
  - `t` continues to be updated to `(t * 2^(k-1)) % MOD`.
  - `ans` is recalculated.

### General Pattern:
- After each iteration, `t` is multiplied by `2^(k-1)` and taken modulo `MOD`.
- `ans` accumulates the results of these calculations.

### Final Output State:
- After all `T` iterations, `t` will be `(initial_t * (2^(k1-1) * 2^(k2-1) * ... * 2^(kT-1))) % MOD`.
- `ans` will be the accumulated sum of all individual `ans` values from each iteration, modulo `MOD`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state is determined by the accumulated `ans` value after all iterations. Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `a` for each iteration, we can only express the final state in terms of the accumulated `ans`.

Output State: **The final value of `ans` after all `T` iterations, which is the accumulated sum of `ans` values from each iteration, modulo `MOD`.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is the result of processing all test cases and accumulating their respective `ans` values, with all operations taken modulo `MOD`.
