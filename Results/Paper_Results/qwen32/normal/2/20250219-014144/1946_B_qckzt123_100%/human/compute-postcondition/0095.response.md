The code snippet sets `tmp` to 0. This affects the value of `tmp` directly, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `max(tmp, 0)`, `tmp` is 0, `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + sum(t * 2^i % MOD for i in range(k-1))) % MOD`, `x` is the next element in `a`**.
