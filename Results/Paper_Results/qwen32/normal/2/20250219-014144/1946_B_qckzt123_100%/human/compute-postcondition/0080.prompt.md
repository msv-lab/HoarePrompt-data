Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 2; n is an integer read from input; k is an integer read from input; a is a list of integers read from input; s is the sum of the elements in a; t is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within a; tmp is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative sums; ans is ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k - 1):
    t *= 2
    t %= MOD
    ans += t
    ans %= MOD


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative sums, `ans` is `(((s + (twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) % MOD) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `((twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) * 2) % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative sums, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is `(((s + (twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) % MOD) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t % MOD`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(((twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) * 2) % MOD) * 2 % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative sums, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is `ans % MOD`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
