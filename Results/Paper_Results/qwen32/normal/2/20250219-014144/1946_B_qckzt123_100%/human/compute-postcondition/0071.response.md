The code snippet `t *= 2` doubles the value of `t`. Given the initial state, `t` is already defined as `(twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) % MOD`. After doubling `t`, its new value will be `(twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) * 2 % MOD`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `((twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) * 2) % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative sums, `ans` is `(((s + (twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) % MOD) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
