The code snippet provided is `tmp += x`. However, there is no variable `x` defined in the initial state. Given this, it seems there might be a mistake or missing information in the provided code snippet. Assuming that `x` was intended to be another variable (possibly `n` or `k`), I'll proceed with the assumption that `x` is `n` for the sake of this example.

Given this assumption, the code would be `tmp += n`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`T` must be greater than `2`; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least one element; `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `t` is 0; `tmp` is `tmp` + `n`.**

In natural language: The value of `tmp` is now the sum of its previous value and the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
