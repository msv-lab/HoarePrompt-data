The code snippet sets `tmp` to `0`. This affects the value of `tmp` directly, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `max(0, 2 * x)`, `tmp` is `0`, `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, and `s` is the sum of the list `a`. `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
