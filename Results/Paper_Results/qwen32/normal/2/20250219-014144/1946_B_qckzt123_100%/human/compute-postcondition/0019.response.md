Output State: **`t` is `max(0, 2 * x)`, `tmp` is `0 + x` if `tmp` was initially less than 0, otherwise `2 * x + x`, `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, and `s` is the sum of the list `a`. `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**

In simpler terms, `tmp` is now the sum of its previous value (which was either `0` or `2 * x`) and the current value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
