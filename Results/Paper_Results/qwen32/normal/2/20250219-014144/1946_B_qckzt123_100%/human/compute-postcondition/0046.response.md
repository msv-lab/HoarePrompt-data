The code snippet initializes two new variables `t` and `tmp` to 0. This does not affect the pre-existing variables `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `s`. Therefore, the only changes are the introduction of `t` and `tmp` with their respective values.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than `2`; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `t` is 0; `tmp` is 0.**
