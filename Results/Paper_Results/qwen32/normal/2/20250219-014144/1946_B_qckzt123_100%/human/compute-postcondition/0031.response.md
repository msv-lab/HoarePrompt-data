The code snippet `t *= 2` doubles the value of `t`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `2 * (t % MOD)`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the last element or 0 if it was reset, `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input where `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `s` is the sum of the list `a`; `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`, `i` is 1**.

In simpler terms, the value of `t` is now twice its original value modulo `MOD`. All other variables retain their initial values.
