The provided code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This means that the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the new input, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 1; `n` and `k` are integers read from the new input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`; `t` is `(t * 2^(k-1)) % MOD`; `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative sums; `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + sum(t * 2^i % MOD for i in range(k-1))) % MOD`.**
