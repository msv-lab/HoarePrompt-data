Output State: **`t` is `t % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the last element or 0 if it was reset, `T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input where `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is the sum of the list `a`, `ans` is `((((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD + t + t) % MOD`, `i` is 2**

In natural language, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `t` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
