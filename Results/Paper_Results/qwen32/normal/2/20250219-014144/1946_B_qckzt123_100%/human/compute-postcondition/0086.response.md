Output State: **`T` is greater than 1; `n` and `k` are integers read from the new input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `s` is the sum of the elements in the new `a`; `t` is 0; `tmp` is 0; `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + sum(t * 2^i % MOD for i in range(k-1))) % MOD`.**

Explanation: The values of `t` and `tmp` have been explicitly set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
