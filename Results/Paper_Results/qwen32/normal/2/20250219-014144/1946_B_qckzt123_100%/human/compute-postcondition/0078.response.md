The code snippet provided increments the variable `ans` by the value of `t`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is `(((twice the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`) * 2) % MOD) * 2 % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative sums, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is `ans + t`.**
