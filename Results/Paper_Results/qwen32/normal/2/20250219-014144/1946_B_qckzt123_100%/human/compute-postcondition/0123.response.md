Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. Specifically, if the conditions defined in the problem are met, it returns a particular value or performs a specific operation, otherwise, it adheres to the problem's specified behavior for those conditions.**
