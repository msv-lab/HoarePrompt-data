You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list a at most 2 times.

        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    #State: The loop has printed the result `ans` for each of the `t` test cases, where `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each element `x` in the count array `cnt` that tracks the occurrences of integers in the list `a` for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a deck of `2n` cards with integers from `1` to `n`, each appearing exactly twice.
- Cards are distributed between two players, you and Nene, each receiving `n` cards.
- Players take turns placing cards on the table. If a card with the same number is already on the table, the player scores a point.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
- We need to determine the maximum number of points you can score assuming optimal play from both sides.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases and calculates the maximum number of points you can get. Here's the core logic:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] += 1
    ans = 0
    for x in cnt:
        ans += max(0, x - 1)
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Program:
1. **Counting Occurrences**: The program counts how many times each number appears in your hand using a list `cnt`.
2. **Calculating Points**: For each unique number, if it appears more than once (`x > 1`), it means you can score a point for the second occurrence. The expression `max(0, x - 1)` effectively counts the number of pairs for each number.
3. **Summing Points**: The total points you can score is the sum of these pair counts.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Optimal Play Assumption**: The program assumes that you will always play optimally, which is reasonable because the problem asks for the maximum points you can get assuming optimal play from both sides.
- **Handling All Cases**: The program correctly handles the scenario where each number can appear at most twice. If a number appears twice, you can score one point for the second occurrence.
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - If a number appears only once, you cannot score any points for that number.
  - If all numbers appear twice, you can score one point per number, which is the maximum possible under optimal play.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score under the given constraints and assumptions. It handles all edge cases and scenarios described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly counts the number of pairs in your hand and sums them up to determine the maximum number of points you can score, assuming optimal play from both sides. This aligns with the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately.
