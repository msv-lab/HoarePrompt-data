The code snippet `cnt[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` zeros. After executing the code, the value at index `x` in `cnt` will be 1 (if it was 0 before) or incremented by 1 (if it had a different value).

Since the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact index that will be incremented. However, we know that the value at that specific index will be increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer value of `t`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where the value at index `x` is incremented by 1.**
