The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. 

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains the integer value of `t`.
- `a` is updated to be a list of integers read from the input.
- `cnt` remains a list of `t + 1` integers.
- `ans` remains the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the integer value of `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers; `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for each `x` in `cnt`.**
