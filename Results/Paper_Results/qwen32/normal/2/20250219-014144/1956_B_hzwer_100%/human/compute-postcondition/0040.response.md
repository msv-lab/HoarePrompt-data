To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variable `t`:** An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **Variable `n`:** Set to the integer value of `t`.
3. **List `a`:** A list of integers read from the input.
4. **List `cnt`:** A list of `t + 1` integers.
5. **Variable `ans`:** Calculated as the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.

### Computation Steps:
1. **Initialization:** `cnt` is initialized as a list of `t + 1` integers. Without specific values, we assume it is initialized with zeros or some other values.
2. **Calculation of `ans`:** 
   - For each element `x` in `cnt`, compute `max(0, x - 1)`.
   - Sum all these computed values to get `ans`.

### Explanation of `ans`:
- `max(0, x - 1)` ensures that if `x` is 0 or 1, the result is 0. If `x` is greater than 1, the result is `x - 1`.
- Therefore, `ans` is essentially the sum of all values in `cnt` minus the number of non-zero elements in `cnt`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `cnt` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe `ans` in terms of `cnt`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for all x in cnt)**
