In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the value read from `sys.stdin.readline`, which is expected to be an integer representing the number of test cases (`t`). The loop will execute `t` times. The variables in the loop head are `_` (which is a common Python convention for a throwaway variable) and the result of `int(input())`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the input function `sys.stdin.readline` returns a string that can be converted to an integer `t` where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. The current state already specifies that `t` is an integer within this range, but we need to ensure that `input()` reflects this.

Here's how we can adjust the state:

- The variable `t` should be set to an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- The `input` function should return a string representation of `t` when called.

Since the loop head only involves the result of `int(input())`, we need to adjust the state of `input` to reflect that it will return a valid string for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `input` is a function that returns the string representation of `t` when called**
