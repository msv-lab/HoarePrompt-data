The code snippet `cnt[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers with one element incremented by 1, and `x` is the next element in `a`.

Since `x` is an element from the list `a`, and `a` contains integers, `cnt[x]` refers to the element at index `x` in the list `cnt`. This element's value is incremented by 1.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`) remain unchanged except for the modification in `cnt`.

Therefore, the updated state is that `cnt[x]` is now `cnt[x] + 1`, while all other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the same integer value as `t`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least two integers, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers with the element at index `x` incremented by 1, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`, adjusted for the incremented element, `x` is the next element in `a`**.
