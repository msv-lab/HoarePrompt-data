The code increments the value at the index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the same as `t`, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers, and `x` is the next element in the list `a`. 

After executing `cnt[x] += 1`, the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` increases by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the integer value of `t`; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers where the value at index `x` has been incremented by 1; `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
