The code snippet reassigns `cnt` to be a list of `n + 1` zeros. This means that the previous values in `cnt` are discarded, and `cnt` now contains `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0.

Since `n` is the same integer value as `t`, the length of `cnt` is `t + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the same integer value as `t`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a list of `t + 1` integers, all initialized to 0, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all `x` in `cnt`.**
