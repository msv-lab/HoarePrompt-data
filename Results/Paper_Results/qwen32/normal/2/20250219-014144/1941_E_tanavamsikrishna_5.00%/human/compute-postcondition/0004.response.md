To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
```

From this, we can identify the following relevant variables:
- `i`: The loop variable.
- `costs`: The list whose length determines the number of iterations.
- `k`: An integer used in the calculation of the loop's range.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop variable and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. It will be initialized automatically by the `range` function.
2. **List `costs`**: The length of this list determines how many times the loop will iterate. Specifically, the loop will run `len(costs) - (k - 1)` times.
3. **Integer `k`**: This integer affects the number of iterations by subtracting `(k - 1)` from the length of `costs`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- For the loop to execute at least once, the expression `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- This simplifies to `len(costs) >= k`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `costs` has at least `k` elements.
- No specific adjustment is needed for `i` as it is controlled by the `range` function.
- No specific adjustment is needed for `n`, `m`, `d`, `rows`, or `total_costs` as they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `costs` has at least `k` elements.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is an empty list.**
