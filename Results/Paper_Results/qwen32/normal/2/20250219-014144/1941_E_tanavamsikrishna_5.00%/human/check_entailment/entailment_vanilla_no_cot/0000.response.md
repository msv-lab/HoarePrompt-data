Let's analyze the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the minimum cost to build `k` bridges over consecutive rows in a grid representing a river. Each bridge spans from the first column to the last column, and supports must be installed at these positions and potentially at other positions within the row, with constraints on the distance between supports.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`**: This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row with the given constraint `d`. It iterates through the row and calculates the cost of placing supports such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
2. **`func_2()`**: This function reads the input, computes the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost to build `k` consecutive bridges by summing up the costs of `k` consecutive rows.

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation in `func_1`**: The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to place supports with the given constraints. The logic used in the function does not ensure that the distance between supports is no more than `d` while minimizing the cost.
- **Handling of Multiple Bridges (`k`)**: The program correctly calculates the cost for each row and then sums up the costs of `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost. However, the cost calculation per row needs to be corrected.

### Example Analysis
Let's consider the first test case from the example:
```
3 11 1 4
0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
```
The expected output is `4`, which corresponds to building a bridge on the second row. The correct placement of supports would be at positions `(2, 1)`, `(2, 6)`, and `(2, 11)` with a total cost of `1 + 7 + 1 = 9` (incorrectly calculated as `4` in the program).

### Conclusion
Given the issues in the cost calculation logic within `func_1`, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **False**
