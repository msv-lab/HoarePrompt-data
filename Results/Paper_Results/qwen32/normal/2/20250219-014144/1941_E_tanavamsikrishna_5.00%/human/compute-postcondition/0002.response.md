The given code snippet updates the `costs` list by applying the function `func_1` to each row in the `rows` list, with the parameter `d`. This means that each element in the `costs` list will now hold the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values that will be computed for each row. However, we can state that the `costs` list will be populated with the results of these computations.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are the integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list of integers where each element represents the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows starting from a particular row.**
