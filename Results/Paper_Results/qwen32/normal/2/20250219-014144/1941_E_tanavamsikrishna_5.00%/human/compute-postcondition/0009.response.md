The code appends the sum of the slice `costs[i:i + k]` to the `total_costs` list. Given the initial state, `total_costs` initially contains two elements: the first being the sum of `costs[0:k]` and the second being the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`. After executing the line `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))`, `total_costs` will now contain three elements.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing three elements, the first being the sum of `costs[0:k]`, the second being the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`, and the third being the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`; `i` is `i + 2`.**
