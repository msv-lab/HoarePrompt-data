The function reads input values for the number of rows (`n`), number of columns (`m`), number of bridges (`k`), and maximum distance between supports (`d`). It processes a grid represented by a 2D list (`rows`) where each row starts and ends with 0. It calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using a helper function `func_1` with the constraint `d`. Then, it computes the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and outputs the minimum of these total costs.
