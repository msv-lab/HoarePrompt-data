Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of columns), `k` (number of bridges), and `d` (maximum distance between supports). It also accepts `rows`, a 2D list representing the grid where each sublist corresponds to a row and the first and last elements of each sublist are 0. Additionally, it accepts `costs`, a list of integers representing the cost of installing supports for each row, and `total_costs`, a list of integers representing the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows starting from a particular row. The function returns the minimum cost required to install supports such that the distance between any two consecutive supports does not exceed `d`.**
