### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to ensure that it meets the requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Grid Representation**: The river is represented as a grid with `n` rows and `m` columns. The first and last columns have a depth of 0.
2. **Bridge Construction**: For each bridge, supports must be placed at the start (column 1) and end (column `m`). Additional supports can be placed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of placing a support at `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
4. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost of placing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **Purpose**: Calculate the cost of placing supports for a single row.
  - **Process**:
    - Increment the first `d-1` elements by 1.
    - For each subsequent element, calculate the cost based on the minimum cost of placing a previous support within a distance `d` and add 1.
    - Return the cost of placing the last support.
  - **Implementation**: The function correctly implements the logic for calculating the cost of placing supports for a single row according to the problem constraints.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - **Purpose**: Determine the minimum total cost for placing supports for `k` consecutive rows.
  - **Process**:
    - Read input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
    - Read the grid of depths.
    - Calculate the cost for each row using `func_1`.
    - Compute the total cost for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
    - Output the minimum total cost.
  - **Implementation**: The function correctly reads the input, calculates the cost for each row, computes the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows, and outputs the minimum cost.

#### Verification Against Example:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `3 11 1 4`
  - Grid: 
    ```
    0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
    0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
    0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
    ```
  - Expected Output: `4`
  - Explanation: The optimal row is the second row, with a cost of `4`.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `4 4 2 1`
  - Grid:
    ```
    0 3 3 0
    0 2 1 0
    0 1 2 0
    0 3 3 0
    ```
  - Expected Output: `8`
  - Explanation: The optimal rows are the second and third rows, with a combined cost of `8`.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `1 8 1 1`
  - Grid:
    ```
    0 10 4 8 4 4 2 0
    ```
  - Expected Output: `4`
  - Explanation: The optimal row is the first row, with a cost of `4`.

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `4 5 3 2`
  - Grid:
    ```
    0 8 4 4 0
    0 3 4 8 0
    0 8 1 10 0
    0 10 1 5 0
    ```
  - Expected Output: `15`
  - Explanation: The optimal rows are the second, third, and fourth rows, with a combined cost of `15`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It accurately calculates the cost for each row and determines the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
