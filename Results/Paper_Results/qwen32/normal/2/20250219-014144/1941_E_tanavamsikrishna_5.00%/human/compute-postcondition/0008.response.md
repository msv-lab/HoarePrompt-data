To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i`.

Here's the given information:
- The loop iterates over the range `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We know that the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to update `i` accordingly.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the current value of `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `x` at the start of the previous iteration, it is now `x + 1`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue:** The loop will continue as long as `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
3. **Adjust the state:** Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment, we simply increment `i` by 1 from its current value.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing two elements, the first being the sum of `costs[0:k]` and the second being the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration would be `i + 1` from the previous state.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing two elements, the first being the sum of `costs[0:k]` and the second being the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

However, to be more precise in reflecting the new value of `i`:
State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers with at least `k` elements, where each element represents the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing two elements, the first being the sum of `costs[0:k]` and the second being the sum of `costs[i:i + k]`; `i` is `i + 2`.**

This reflects that `i` has been incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
