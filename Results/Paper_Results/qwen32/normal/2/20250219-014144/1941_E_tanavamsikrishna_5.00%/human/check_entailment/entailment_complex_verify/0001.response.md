### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to ensure that it correctly implements the problem's requirements.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
- Each row must have supports at the first and last columns (depth 0).
- Supports can also be placed at other columns within a distance `d` constraint.
- The cost of placing a support at position `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`.
- We need to minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Purpose:** Calculate the minimum cost to install supports for a single row.
   - **Logic:**
     - Increment the cost of the first `d-1` positions by 1.
     - For each subsequent position `i` from `d-1` to the end of the row, calculate the cost as `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) + row[i] + 1`.
     - Return the cost of the last position in the row.
   - **Issue:** The function does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the problem constraints. Specifically, it does not ensure that supports are placed at the first and last columns and does not properly enforce the distance `d` constraint between supports.
     - The function incorrectly increments the first `d-1` positions by 1 without ensuring they are supports.
     - The logic for calculating the cost of subsequent positions does not correctly enforce the `d` constraint between supports.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Purpose:** Read input, compute the cost for each row using `func_1`, and find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Logic:**
     - Read the input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
     - Read the grid of depths.
     - Compute the cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - Iterate through all possible starting points for `k` consecutive rows and sum up their costs.
     - Output the minimum total cost among all possible combinations.
   - **Issue:** Since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost for a single row, the total costs computed in `func_2` will also be incorrect.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program at key points but do not address the logical errors in `func_1`.
- The annotations confirm that `func_1` modifies the row and returns the last element, but they do not verify that this modification correctly enforces the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly calculate the cost of installing supports for a single row according to the problem constraints. The logic for placing supports and enforcing the distance `d` constraint is flawed.

**Final: False**
