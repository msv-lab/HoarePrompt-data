The provided code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. These variables represent the number of rows, the number of columns, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports, respectively. 

Since the initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are already defined as positive integers, the code overwrites these variables with new values read from the input. The other variables (`rows`, `costs`, and `total_costs`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are the integers read from the input; `rows` is a 2D list of integers where each sublist represents a row in the grid, with the first and last elements of each sublist being 0; `costs` is a list of integers where each element represents the cost of installing supports for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list of integers where each element represents the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows starting from a particular row.**
