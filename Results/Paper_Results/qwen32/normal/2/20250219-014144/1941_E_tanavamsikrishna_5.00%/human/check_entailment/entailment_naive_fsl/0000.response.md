Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem described. Specifically, the `func_1` function is not correctly calculating the minimum cost of placing supports for a single row according to the constraints provided.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation in `func_1`:**
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a row such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, the current implementation incorrectly adds `1` to every element in the row up to `d-1` and then calculates the cost for the rest of the row based on the minimum value in the previous `d+1` elements. This approach does not ensure that the supports are placed optimally to minimize the total cost while respecting the distance constraint `d`.

2. **Handling of Distance Constraint `d`:**
   - The code does not properly handle the distance constraint `d`. It should ensure that the supports are placed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`, which involves a more complex dynamic programming approach or another method to ensure optimal placement.

### Potential Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 5 1 2
0 3 1 3 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 3 1 3 0
0 1 2 1 0
```

For this test case, the optimal solution would involve placing supports in a way that minimizes the total cost while ensuring the distance between supports is no more than `2`. The provided code might not handle this scenario correctly due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve using dynamic programming to find the optimal placement of supports for each row, considering the distance constraint `d`. The idea is to maintain a DP array where `dp[j]` represents the minimum cost to place supports up to column `j` in the current row, respecting the distance constraint.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect for all potential cases where the distance constraint `d` needs to be respected optimally.
