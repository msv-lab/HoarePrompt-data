Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is the new string input provided by the user; `results` is a list that contains 'no' if `arr` contains exactly two consecutive '1's or if `arr.count('1') % 2 != 0`, otherwise it contains 'yes'; `i` is incremented by 1. If `arr` contains exactly two consecutive '1's, `results` will contain one additional 'no'.**
