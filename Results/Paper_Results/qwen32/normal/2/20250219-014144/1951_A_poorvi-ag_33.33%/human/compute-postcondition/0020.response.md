Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the new string input provided by the user; `results` is a list containing the string 'no'; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The `results` list initially contained either 'no' or 'yes' based on the conditions specified. After executing `results.append('no')`, the `results` list will definitely contain 'no' as its last element, regardless of its previous content. All other variables remain unchanged.
