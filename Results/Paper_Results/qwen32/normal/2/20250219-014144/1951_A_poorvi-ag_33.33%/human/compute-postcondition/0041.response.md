Let's analyze the given task step by step:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is at least 1.
- `results` is a list of length `t+1` containing only the strings `'yes'` or `'no'`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(r)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet attempts to print the variable `r`.
- However, there is no mention of a variable `r` in the initial state provided. This means that the variable `r` is either undefined or not mentioned in the context given.

### Conclusion:
Since the variable `r` is not defined or mentioned in the initial state, it is impossible to determine what `r` would contain. Therefore, the code would raise a `NameError` because `r` is not defined.

However, if we assume the task is asking us to describe what would be printed if `r` were defined in some way consistent with the initial state, we need more information about `r`. Since `r` is not defined, the most accurate answer is to state that `r` is undefined.

### Final Output:
Output: **NameError: name 'r' is not defined** (assuming `r` is not defined in the given context)
