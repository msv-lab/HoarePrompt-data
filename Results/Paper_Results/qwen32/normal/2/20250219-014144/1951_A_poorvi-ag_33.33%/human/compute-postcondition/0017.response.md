The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `t` is a given positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given that `i` was the loop counter at the end of the previous iteration, it should be incremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the string input provided by the user. If `arr` contains exactly two consecutive '1's ('11' is a substring of `arr'), `results` is a list containing the string 'no'. If `arr` contains an even number of '1's and does not have '11' as a substring, `results` is a list containing the single element 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing the string 'no'; `i` is incremented by 1**
