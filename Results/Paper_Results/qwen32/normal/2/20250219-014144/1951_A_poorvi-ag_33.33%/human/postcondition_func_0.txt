The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `arr`. It then determines if the string `arr` meets specific conditions related to the count of '1's in the string and prints 'yes' or 'no' accordingly. The function does not accept `start` and `end` as parameters and does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly.
