Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the string input provided by the user and does not contain an even number of '1's. If `arr` contains exactly two occurrences of the character '1' with these two '1's being consecutive ('11' is a substring of `arr`), then `results` is a list containing the string 'no'. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing the string 'no'.**

Explanation: The `results` list now contains the string 'no', regardless of its previous state. All other variables remain unchanged.
