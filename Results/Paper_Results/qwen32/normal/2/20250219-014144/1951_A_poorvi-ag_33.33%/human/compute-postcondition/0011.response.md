Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the string input provided by the user and contains an even number of occurrences of the character '1'; `results` is a list that remains an empty list because either `arr` does not have exactly two occurrences of '1' or '11' is not a substring of `arr`.**
