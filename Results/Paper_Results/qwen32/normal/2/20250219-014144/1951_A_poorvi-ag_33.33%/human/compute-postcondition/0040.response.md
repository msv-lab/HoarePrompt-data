The only object in the loop head is the variable `r`, which iterates over the elements of the list `results`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `r` and how it relates to the `results` list.

Given that `r` is currently the last element processed from the `results` list, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the `results` list to process. This means that the `results` list must have more than `t` elements if `t` is the current length, or `r` must point to the next element in the list.

Since `r` is an element of `results` and not an index, we cannot directly adjust `r` to point to the next element. However, we can infer that the loop will naturally move to the next element in the list during its iteration. Therefore, the state of `r` will change to the next element in the `results` list.

However, since we are asked to adjust the state based on the objects in the loop head, and `r` is the only variable in the loop head, we can state that `r` will be the next element in the `results` list during the next iteration.

State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is at least 1, `results` is a list of length `t+1` containing `'yes'` or `'no'`**
(Note: Here, we assume that `t` was the length of `results` at the end of the previous iteration, and now `results` has one more element to allow the loop to execute one more time.)

Alternatively, if we strictly adhere to adjusting only the loop head variables without changing the length of `results`, we can say:

State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is at least 1, `results` is a list of length `t` containing `'yes'` or `'no'`, and `r` is the next element in `results`** (This is more of a conceptual statement rather than a concrete adjustment, as `r` is determined by the loop itself.)

Given the constraints, the most appropriate answer would be:

State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is at least 1, `results` is a list of length `t+1` containing `'yes'` or `'no'`**
