Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is the string input provided by the user and contains an even number of occurrences of the character '1'. If `arr` contains exactly two consecutive '1's ('11' is a substring of `arr'), `results` is a list containing the strings 'no' and 'no'. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing the single element 'yes'.**
