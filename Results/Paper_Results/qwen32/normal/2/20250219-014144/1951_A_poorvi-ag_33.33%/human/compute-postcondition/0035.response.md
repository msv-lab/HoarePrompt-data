Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is the new string input provided by the user; `results` is a list that contains 'no' if `arr` contains exactly two consecutive '1's or if `arr.count('1') % 2 != 0`, otherwise it contains 'yes', and now `results` also contains an additional 'no'; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The `results` list has an additional 'no' appended to it, and `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial states.
