The only variable in the loop head is `r`, which iterates over the elements of the list `results`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `r` and how it changes during the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is at least 1.
- `results` is a list of length `t+1` containing `'yes'` or `'no'`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `r` would have taken on the value of the last element in `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `results` to iterate over. However, since `results` is of fixed length `t+1`, once all elements have been iterated over, the loop will terminate.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `results` sequentially, the state at the start of the next iteration would involve `r` taking on the value of the next element in `results`.

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `r` was the `k`-th element of `results`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `r` will be the `(k+1)`-th element of `results`.

However, since the problem does not specify the exact position of `r` in the previous iteration, we can generalize that `r` will simply be the next element in the sequence as the loop progresses.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is at least 1, `results` is a list of length `t+1` containing `'yes'` or `'no'`, `r` is the next element in `results`**.

Since we don't have the specific value of `r` from the previous iteration, we cannot pinpoint the exact next value of `r`, but we know it will be the subsequent element in the list `results`.
