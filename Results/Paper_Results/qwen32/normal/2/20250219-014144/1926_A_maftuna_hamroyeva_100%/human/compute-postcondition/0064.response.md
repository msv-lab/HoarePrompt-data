The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `j` is 'A', `l` was initially 2 and is now 3. Otherwise, if `j` is not 'A', `l` was initially 1 and is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, `i` is 2, `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the fourth character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 3 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 2 and `h` is 2.**
