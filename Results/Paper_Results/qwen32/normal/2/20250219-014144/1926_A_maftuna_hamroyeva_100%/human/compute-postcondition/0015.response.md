The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, which iterates over each character in the string `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `j` and how it changes during the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the first character of the string `a`. In the next iteration, `j` should be the second character of the string `a`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `j` needs to be updated to the next character in the string `a`.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `l`, `h`) do not need to be modified as they are not part of the loop head.

Since `j` is currently the first character of `a`, in the next iteration, `j` should be the second character of `a`. We don't have specific information about the length of `a` or its characters beyond the first one, but we know that `a` is a non-empty string.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty string input by the user, `j` is the second character of `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 1 and `h` is 1.**
