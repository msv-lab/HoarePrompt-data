The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This means that `results` now contains the element `'no'`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 6, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `i` is 7, `results` contains the element `'no'`**.
