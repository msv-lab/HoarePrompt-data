Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100; each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, followed by a string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters 'U' and 'D'; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        results.append('no')
    elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
        results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 5, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string, and `results` contains `'no'` if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, `results` contains `'yes'` if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`; otherwise, `results` contains `'no'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 6, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `i` is 6. If `n` is even, `results` contains its original elements plus `'no'`. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`, `results` contains its original value plus `'yes'`. Otherwise, `results` contains its original value plus `'no'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 6, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `i` is 7, and `results` contains `'no'` if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, `results` contains `'yes'` if the count of `'U'` in `arr` is greater than the count of `'D'` in `arr`; otherwise, `results` contains `'no'`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
