The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented from its current value of 6 to 7. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it defines the total number of iterations.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is greater than 6, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `i` is 6, and the conditions for `results` are based on `n` and the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 7 and `t` must still be greater than 6 (since `i` must be less than `t` for the loop to continue).

State: **`t` is greater than 6, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `i` is 7**
