In the given initial state, it is mentioned that `results` is a list with at least one element, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`. However, there is no mention of a variable `i` being defined anywhere in the initial state. Therefore, the variable `i` does not have an explicit value provided, and its value is unknown based on the given information.

Given this situation, the `print(i)` statement would result in a `NameError` because `i` is not defined in the provided context. 

However, if we assume that `i` was intended to be an index related to the `results` list (a common scenario), we would need additional information about how `i` is defined or assigned a value. Since no such definition is provided, we cannot determine the value of `i`.

Thus, based on the information provided:

Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**
