To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and accumulates results based on the given conditions.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each iteration (test case):
  - An integer `n` is read, representing the length of the string `arr`.
  - A string `arr` of length `n` is read, containing only 'U' and 'D'.
  - If `n` is even, the result for this test case is `'no'`.
  - If `n` is odd:
    - If the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', the result is `'yes'`.
    - Otherwise, the result is `'no'`.

### Final Output State:
After all `t` iterations, the `results` list will contain `t` elements, each corresponding to the result of one test case.

### Given Information:
- Initial State: `results` is an empty list.
- After the first 3 iterations, the `results` list contains 3 elements, each determined by the conditions described above.

### Conclusion:
After all `t` iterations, the `results` list will contain `t` elements, each being either `'yes'` or `'no'` based on the conditions specified for each test case.

### Output State:
Output State: **`results` is a list of `t` elements, each being either `'yes'` or `'no'` based on the conditions of each test case.**

### Human-readable Description:
The final output state is that the `results` list contains exactly `t` elements, where each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`. Each element corresponds to the result of processing one test case according to the specified rules: `'no'` if the length of the string is even, or `'yes'` if the length is odd and the number of 'U's is greater than the number of 'D's.
