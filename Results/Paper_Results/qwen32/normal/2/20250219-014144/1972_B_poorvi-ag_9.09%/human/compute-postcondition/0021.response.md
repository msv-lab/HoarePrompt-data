Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 6, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `i` is 6. If `n` is even, `results` contains its original elements plus `'no'`. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`, `results` contains its original value plus `'yes'`. Otherwise, `results` contains its original value plus `'no'`.**
