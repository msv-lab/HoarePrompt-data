You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of 'U' and 'D' characters. It determines if the number of 'U' characters is greater than the number of 'D' characters in strings of odd lengths, appending 'yes' to the results if true, otherwise 'no'. For even-length strings, it appends 'no'. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

The game revolves around the number of coins and their orientations. Here are the key points:

1. **Game Rules:**
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up ("U") coin.
   - When a coin is removed, the two adjacent coins are flipped.
   - Special cases:
     - If only two coins remain, removing one leaves the other unflipped.
     - If only one coin remains, no flips occur.
     - If no facing-up coins remain, the current player loses.
   
2. **Winning Strategy:**
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The outcome depends on the initial configuration of the coins and the parity (odd/even) of the number of coins.

3. **Key Insight:**
   - If the number of coins `n` is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.
   - If the number of coins `n` is odd, the winner depends on the number of facing-up coins:
     - If the number of "U" coins is greater than the number of "D" coins, Alice wins.
     - Otherwise, Bob wins.

### Program Analysis:

Let's examine the provided code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)
```

- **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the coin orientations.
- **Even Number of Coins (`n % 2 == 0`):** The program correctly appends 'no' to the results list, indicating Bob wins.
- **Odd Number of Coins (`n % 2 != 0`):** The program checks if the count of "U" coins is greater than the count of "D" coins. If true, it appends 'yes' (Alice wins); otherwise, it appends 'no' (Bob wins).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic derived from the problem analysis. It handles both even and odd numbers of coins appropriately and determines the winner based on the number of facing-up coins when the number of coins is odd.

Therefore, the program is correct.
