The code appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged. The initial condition regarding `results` depends on whether `n` is even or odd and the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `arr`. After appending `'yes'`, `results` will include an additional element `'yes'`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 6, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the new input string, `results` contains its initial value plus `'yes'`, `i` is 6**.
