To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop iterates over the range defined by `t`. Therefore, the state of `t` is the only one that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

Given that `t` is already described as an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range. Since the problem specifies that `t` is already constrained to be within this valid range, no further adjustment to `t` is necessary for the loop to execute.

However, since the task requires us to specify the state explicitly, we can confirm that `t` should be set to a value within its specified range. For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `t` is set to 5 (any value between 1 and 100 would work).

Thus, the state before the loop starts, ensuring the loop will execute, is:

State: **`t` is 5** (or any integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)).

Since the other variables (`n`, `s`, and `results`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, they remain as they are described in the problem statement. However, for completeness, we can include them in the state description:

State: **`t` is 5 (or any integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `s` is a string of length `n` containing only 'U' and 'D', `results` is an empty list**. 

But strictly adhering to the requirement to only adjust the state of objects in the loop head, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is 5** (or any integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)).
