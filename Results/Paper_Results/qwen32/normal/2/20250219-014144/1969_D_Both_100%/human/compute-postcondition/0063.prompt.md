Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `heap` contains up to `k` elements from `combined` in the order they were popped; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed and stored in `removed_item`. `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was pushed. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]` from the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` based on the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`. Specifically, if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` minus `removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]` minus `removed_item[0]`. If `removed_item` is falsy, `current_profit` is calculated as in the original precondition without adjusting for `removed_item`. `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `combined` contains one less element than it did initially; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed and stored in `removed_item`; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was pushed; `current_profit` is adjusted based on `removed_item` and `item` as described in the initial state, now decreased by `removed_item[0]` if `removed_item` is truthy; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `combined` contains at least one element except the last one that was popped; `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed and stored in `removed_item`. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is adjusted by decreasing it by `removed_item[0]` and then further decreased by `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, otherwise increased by `item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer). `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0). `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1. `combined` contains at least one element except the last one that was just popped. `item` is the last element that was just popped from `combined`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
