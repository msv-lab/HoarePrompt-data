The code snippet assigns the values returned by `func_2()` to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the specific values returned by `func_2()` are not provided, we denote them as the new values assigned to `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`combined` is empty, `heap` is an empty list, `current_profit` reflects the final profit, `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is unchanged, `neg_prices` is unchanged, `bonuses` is unchanged, `test_cases` is greater than 0.**

In natural language: The variables `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_2()`. All other variables retain their initial values.
