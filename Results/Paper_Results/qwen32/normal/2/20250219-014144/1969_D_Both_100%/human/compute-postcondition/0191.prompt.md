Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `combined` is a sorted list of tuples with `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k)` elements remaining. If `combined` is non-empty, `heap` contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined`. `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `combined` is a sorted list of tuples with `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k) - 1` elements remaining; `item` is the last element removed from `combined` and satisfies either `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `item[0] + item[1] < 0`; `heap` contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined` with `item` pushed and the smallest element popped; if `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or adding `item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and then further adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `heap` is updated with `item` pushed and the smallest element popped; `removed_item` holds the smallest element from the heap after the operation; `combined` has one less element than it did initially; `item` is the last element that was just removed from `combined`; if `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or adding `item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and then further adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `heap` is updated with `item` pushed and the smallest element popped; `removed_item` holds the smallest element from the heap after the operation; `combined` has one less element, and `item` is the last element that was just removed from `combined`; if `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or adding `item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and then further adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]` if `removed_item` is not None; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is now `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
