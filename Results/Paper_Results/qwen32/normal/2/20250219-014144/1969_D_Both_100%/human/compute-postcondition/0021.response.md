Postcondition: **`heap` includes `popped_tuple` from `combined` if `combined` was non-empty; `combined` has one less element than before if it was non-empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1. If `combined` was non-empty, the last element of `combined` is popped and added to `heap`.**
