Postcondition: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples with `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k) - 1` elements remaining; `item` is the last element removed from `combined` and satisfies `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`; `heap` contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined`; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`; `max_profit` is updated if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0.**
