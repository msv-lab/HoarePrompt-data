Postcondition: **`combined` has one less element than it did initially; `item` is the last element that was just removed from `combined`; `heap` contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined` with `item` pushed and the smallest element popped; if `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or adding `item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and then further adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`.**
