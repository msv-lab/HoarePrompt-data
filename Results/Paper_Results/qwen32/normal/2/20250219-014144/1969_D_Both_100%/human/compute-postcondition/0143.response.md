Postcondition: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple. If `combined` was not empty initially, it now has one less element, and the last tuple from the original `combined` is added to `heap`. If `combined` was empty, no changes are made to `heap`. `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, and `k` must be greater than 0.**
