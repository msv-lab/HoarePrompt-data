Postcondition: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed and stored in `removed_item`; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was pushed and `removed_item` is truthy (not None, False, 0, or an empty collection); `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` plus `item[0]`. `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `combined` contains one less element than it did initially; `item` is the last element that was in `combined`.**
