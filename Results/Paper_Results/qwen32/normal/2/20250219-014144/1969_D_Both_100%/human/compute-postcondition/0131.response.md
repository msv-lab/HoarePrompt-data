Output State: **`combined` is empty, `heap` is an empty list, `current_profit` reflects the final profit, `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are unchanged, `prices` is unchanged, `neg_prices` is unchanged, `bonuses` is unchanged, `test_cases` is greater than 0**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `remaining_items` is explicitly set to an empty list. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
