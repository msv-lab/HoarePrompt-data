The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` performs two main operations:
1. It removes the last element from the `combined` list using `combined.pop()`.
2. It pushes this removed element into the `heap` using `heapq.heappush(heap, ...)`.

Given the initial state, `combined` had one less element than before if it was non-empty, and `heap` included `popped_tuple` from `combined` if `combined` was non-empty. After executing the code, `combined` will have one less element, and `heap` will include the newly popped tuple from `combined`.

The other variables (`remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `test_cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` includes the tuple that was the last element of `combined` before the pop operation; `combined` has one less element than before the pop operation; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1.**
