The `while` loop condition is `while combined:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `combined` is not empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `combined` contains at least one fewer element than it did initially.
- `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`.
- Several other variables (`heap`, `removed_item`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `test_cases`) are described, but they are not part of the loop condition.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `combined` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `combined` contains at least one element.

State: **`combined` contains at least one element, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `heap` will contain the last `k` elements that were originally in `combined` with `item` replacing the smallest element if `removed_item` is truthy, `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added, `current_profit` will be the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]` minus `removed_item[0]` if `removed_item` is truthy; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `remaining_items` will be an empty list, `n` will be the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` will be the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` will be the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` will be a list of negative prices, `bonuses` will be the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` will have been decremented by 1.**
