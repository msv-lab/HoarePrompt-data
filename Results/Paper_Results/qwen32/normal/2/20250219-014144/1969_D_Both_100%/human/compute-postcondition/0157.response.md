To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition of the loop, which is `while combined:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `combined` is not an empty list.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `combined` is a sorted list of tuples with `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k)` elements remaining.
- `heap` contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined`.
- `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`.
- `max_profit` is updated if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`.
- `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `test_cases` is greater than 0.

The key variable here is `combined`. For the loop to execute at least once, `combined` must not be an empty list. Therefore, we need to ensure that `combined` has at least one element.

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Condition Analysis**: The loop condition is `while combined:`. This means `combined` should have at least one element for the loop to start.
2. **Current State**: The current state specifies that `combined` is a sorted list with `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k)` elements. To ensure the loop executes, this value must be at least 1.
3. **Adjustment**: We need to make sure that `len(combined_initial) - k` is at least 1. This implies `len(combined_initial)` must be greater than `k`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, `combined` must have at least one element. This requires `len(combined_initial)` to be greater than `k`.

State: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples with `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k)` elements remaining, where `len(combined_initial) > k`; `heap` contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined`; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`; `max_profit` is updated if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0**.
