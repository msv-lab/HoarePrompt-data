Output State: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples with `max(0, len(combined_initial) - k)` elements remaining. If `combined` is non-empty, `heap` contains `min(k, len(combined_initial))` tuples from the original `combined`. `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` and is greater than `max_profit`. `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `test_cases` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `max_profit` is now updated to the value of `current_profit`. All other variables retain their initial state.
