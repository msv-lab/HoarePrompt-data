In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a throwaway variable) and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0 because the loop iterates `k` times.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `k`. The other variables (`combined`, `heap`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, and `test_cases`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop will execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `k` must be greater than 0.

State: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a corresponding element from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple; `heap` is an empty list; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0; `k` must be greater than 0**
