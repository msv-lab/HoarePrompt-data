Postcondition: **`combined` will either be empty or contain `len(combined) - k` elements left. `heap` will contain the last `k` elements that were originally in `combined`. If `combined` is not empty, `current_profit` will be the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0. `max_profit` will be 0. `remaining_items` will be an empty list. `n` will be the first value returned by `func_2()`. `k` will be the second value returned by `func_2()`. `prices` will be the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` will be a list of negative prices. `bonuses` will be the list returned by `func_2()`. `test_cases` will have been decremented by 1.**
