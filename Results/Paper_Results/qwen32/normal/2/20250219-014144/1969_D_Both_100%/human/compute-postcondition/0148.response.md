The given code snippet modifies the `heap` and `combined` lists. Specifically, it removes the last element from `combined` and pushes it onto the `heap`.

Given the initial state:
- `combined` is a sorted list of tuples.
- If `combined` was not empty, it now has one less element, and the last tuple from the original `combined` is added to `heap`.
- If `combined` was empty, no changes are made to `heap`.
- `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is greater than 0, and `k` must be greater than 0.

After executing the code:
- The last element of `combined` is removed and pushed onto `heap`.
- If `combined` was originally empty, there is no change to `heap` or `combined`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`combined` is a sorted list of tuples with one less element (if it was not empty initially); `heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` (if `combined` was not empty initially); `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of negated values from `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is greater than 0; and `k` must be greater than 0.**
