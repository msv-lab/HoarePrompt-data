The given code snippet performs the following operations:

1. It pops the last element from the `combined` list (since `combined` is sorted and `pop()` without an index removes the last element).
2. It pushes this popped element into the `heap` using `heapq.heappush`.

Given these operations, the state changes are:
- `heap` now contains one more element, which is the last element of the original `combined` list.
- `combined` now has one less element, specifically the last element that was just pushed into `heap`.

The other variables (`current_profit`, `max_profit`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple, excluding the last element; `heap` is a list containing the last element of the original `combined` list; `current_profit` is 0; `max_profit` is 0; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` must be greater than 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`.**
