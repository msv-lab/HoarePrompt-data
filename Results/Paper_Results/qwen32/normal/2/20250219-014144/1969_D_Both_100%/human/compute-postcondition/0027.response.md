The code assigns the value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. This means that `max_profit` now holds the same value as `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements from `combined` in the order they were popped; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is the value of `current_profit`; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` which is greater than `max_profit`; `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1.**
