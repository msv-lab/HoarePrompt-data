The given code snippet updates the value of `max_profit` to be equal to `current_profit`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`heap` contains up to `k` elements including `item` with the smallest element removed and stored in `removed_item`; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was pushed; `current_profit` is adjusted based on `removed_item` and `item` as described in the initial state, now decreased by `removed_item[0]` if `removed_item` is truthy; `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is `new_n` (a positive integer); `k` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices for Alice, where each element is the negative of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 1; `combined` contains at least one element except the last one that was popped; `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined`.**
