The code snippet `path = data[index]` updates the value of `path` to the value of `data[index]`. Given that `index` is 6, `path` will now be set to `data[6]`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`path` is `data[6]`; `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`; `t` must be greater than 1 (specifically, `t` should be adjusted to `t - 1`); `index` is 6; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1('a_3')` and the return value of `func_1(data[4])`; `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`.**
