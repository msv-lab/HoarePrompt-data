### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

#### Problem Description Recap:
The problem involves determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur sequentially. Specifically:
- The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.
- Once the i-th sign occurs, the tribe waits for the (i+1)-th sign to occur strictly after the i-th sign.

#### Code Analysis:

**Function `func_1`:**
- This function takes a string `path` consisting of characters '@' and '*'.
- It uses dynamic programming to compute a score based on the sequence of these characters.
- It assigns a score of `1` for '@' and `-inf` for '*', and computes a cumulative score using a DP array.
- The function returns the maximum score from the DP array that is greater than `-inf`.

**Function `func_2`:**
- This function reads input from standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- Each test case is expected to contain a string (`path`), which is passed to `func_1`.
- The results from `func_1` are printed.

#### Evaluation Against the Problem:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function is designed to process a sequence of '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the problem of determining the year of the n-th sign.
   - There is no mechanism in `func_1` to handle periodic occurrences or sequential constraints of the signs.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function reads input and processes it into test cases, but it incorrectly passes a string of space-separated integers to `func_1`.
   - Since `func_1` does not address the problem requirements, the results from `func_2` will also be incorrect.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Start from year `0`.
- For each sign, determine the next occurrence year based on its periodicity and ensure it occurs strictly after the previous sign.
- Keep track of the current year and update it as each sign occurs.

A correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(periods):
    current_year = 0
    for period in periods:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year
        current_year = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periods = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Final Evaluation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are unrelated to the problem requirements.

**Final: False**
