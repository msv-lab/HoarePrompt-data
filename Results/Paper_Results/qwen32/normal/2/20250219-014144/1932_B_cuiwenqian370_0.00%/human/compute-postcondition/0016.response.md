Output State: **`path` is `data[4]`; `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`; `t` must be greater than 1; `index` is 5; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1('a_3')` and the return value of `func_1(data[4])`; `n` is the integer value of `a_2` (which is assumed to be 2 if `data[1]` is `'2'`).**

Natural Language Explanation: The `results` list now includes an additional element, which is the return value of `func_1(path)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
