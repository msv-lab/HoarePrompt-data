Let's break down the given initial state and determine the value that will be printed by the `print(result)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`data`**: A list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']` where `a_1` is a valid integer.
2. **`t`**: The integer value of `a_1` (the first element of `data`).
3. **`path`**: The element at index `2*t` in the `data` list.
4. **`index`**: Calculated as `1 + 2*t`.
5. **`results`**: A list containing at least two elements.
6. **`result`**: The second element of the `results` list.

### Analysis:
- The value of `t` is derived from the first element of `data`, which is `a_1`. Since `a_1` is described as a valid integer, let's denote it as `t`.
- `path` is determined by the element at index `2*t` in the `data` list. This means that `2*t` must be a valid index in the `data` list.
- `index` is simply `1 + 2*t`.
- `results` is a list with at least two elements, and `result` is the second element of this list (`results[1]`).

### What is printed?
The `print(result)` statement will print the second element of the `results` list. Since the exact contents of the `results` list are not specified, we can only describe it in terms of its definition.

### Final Output:
Output: **result (where result is the second element of the results list)**
