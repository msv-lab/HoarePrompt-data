The code increments the value of `index` by 1. Given the initial state, `index` was 4, so after the increment, `index` becomes 5. The other variables (`path`, `data`, `t`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path` is `data[4]`; `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`; `t` must be greater than 1; `index` is 5; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1('a_3')`; `n` is the integer value of `a_2` (which is assumed to be 2 if `data[1]` is `'2'`).**
