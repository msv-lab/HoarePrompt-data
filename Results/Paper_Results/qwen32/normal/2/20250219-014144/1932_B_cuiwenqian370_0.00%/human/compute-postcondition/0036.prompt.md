You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', representing different conditions in a sequence, and the length of path (n) is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', representing different conditions in a sequence, and the length of `path` (n) is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `n` is the length of `path`.
    dp = [0] * n
    if (path[0] == '@') :
        dp[0] = 1
    else :
        if (path[0] == '*') :
            dp[0] = -float('inf')
        #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', representing different conditions in a sequence, and the length of `path` (n) is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `n` is the length of `path`; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n` except the first element which is `-inf`. The first element of `path` is '*'
    #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', representing different conditions in a sequence, and the length of `path` (n) is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `n` is the length of `path`; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n` except the first element which is 1 if the first element of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf` if the first element of `path` is '*'
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else :
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
        #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', representing different conditions in a sequence, and the length of `path` (n) is a non-negative integer greater than 1; `n` is the length of `path`. `dp` is a list where the first element is 1 if the first element of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`. If the second element of `path` is '*', the second element of `dp` is `-inf`; otherwise, the second element of `dp` is 2 if the first element of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`. All other elements of `dp` are 0.
    #State: `path` is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*', representing different conditions in a sequence, and the length of `path` (n) is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `n` is the length of `path`. `dp` is a list where the first element is 1 if the first element of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`. If `n` is greater than 1, the second element of `dp` is `-inf` if the second element of `path` is '*', otherwise, it is 2 if the first element of `path` is '@', otherwise it is `-inf`. All other elements of `dp` are 0.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: the final `dp` list after processing all elements of `path`.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value from the `dp` list that is greater than negative infinity.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`, which is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*'. The function returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the maximum value from the `dp` list that is greater than negative infinity.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value from the `dp` list that is greater than negative infinity.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
