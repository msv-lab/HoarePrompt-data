To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to consider the pattern established in the first three iterations and extrapolate it to the end of the loop.

From the provided information:
- The loop runs `t` times.
- In each iteration, `n` is set to the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `path` is updated to `data[index + 1]`.
- `index` is incremented by 2 after each iteration.
- `results` appends the result of `func_1(path)`.

Given that the loop runs `t` times, let's break down the final state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `path` is a string representing space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
   - `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n'].
   - `t` is the integer value of `a_1`.
   - `index` is 1.
   - `results` is an empty list.

2. **After `t` Iterations:**
   - The loop will run `t` times, meaning `index` will increment by 2 in each iteration.
   - After `t` iterations, `index` will be `1 + 2*t`.
   - `results` will contain `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(path)` where `path` was updated in each iteration.
   - `path` will be `data[1 + 2*(t-1) + 1]`, which simplifies to `data[2*t]`.

Thus, the final output state will be:
- `path` will be `data[2*t]`.
- `data` remains unchanged as `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`.
- `t` remains unchanged as the integer value of `a_1`.
- `index` will be `1 + 2*t`.
- `results` will be a list containing `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(path)` from each iteration.

Output State: **`path` is `data[2*t]`; `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`; `t` is the integer value of `a_1`; `index` is `1 + 2*t`; `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(path)` for each iteration.**
