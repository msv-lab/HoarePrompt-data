Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`.
   - `a_1` is a valid integer such that `2*t` is a valid index in `data`.
   - `t` is the integer value of `a_1`.
   - `path` is `data[2*t]`.
   - `index` is `1 + 2*t`.
   - `results` is a list containing at least one element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `result` is not explicitly defined in the initial state.
   - There is a variable `results` which is a list containing at least one element, but it is not clear if this is related to `result`.
   - Given the context, it seems there might be a typo or misunderstanding in the variable name used in the print statement (`result` vs `results`).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `result` is not defined in the initial state, the code would raise a `NameError` if executed as is.
   - Assuming the intention was to print the first element of the `results` list (which is the return value of `func_1(path)`), the correct print statement should be `print(results[0])`.

Given the above analysis, the most precise description based on the provided information is that the variable `result` is not defined. However, if we assume the intention was to print the first element of the `results` list, then:

Output: **results[0] (where results[0] is the return value of func_1(path))**

Since the question specifically asks about what will be printed with the given print statement, and `result` is not defined, the accurate output considering the given code is:

Output: **NameError: name 'result' is not defined**
