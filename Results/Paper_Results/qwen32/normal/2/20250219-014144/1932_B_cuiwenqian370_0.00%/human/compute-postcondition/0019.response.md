The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `index` was 5, so after the increment, `index` becomes 6. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path` is `data[4]`; `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`; `t` must be greater than 1 (specifically, `t` should be adjusted to `t - 1`); `index` is 6; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1('a_3')` and the return value of `func_1(data[4])`; `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`.**
