The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to `n`. Given that `index` is 5, `n` will be assigned the integer value of `data[5]`. Since `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`, `data[5]` corresponds to `'a_6'`. However, since the problem does not specify the exact value of `data[5]`, we cannot determine the exact integer value of `n` from the given information. We can only say that `n` will be the integer representation of whatever string `data[5]` holds.

The other variables (`path`, `data`, `t`, `index`, `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path` is `data[4]`; `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`; `t` must be greater than 1 (specifically, `t` should be adjusted to `t - 1`); `index` is 5; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1('a_3')` and the return value of `func_1(data[4])`; `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`.**
