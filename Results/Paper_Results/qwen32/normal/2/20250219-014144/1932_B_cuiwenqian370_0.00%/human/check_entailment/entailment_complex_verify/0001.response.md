### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand why the program does not solve the problem correctly.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicity of each sign and the condition that each subsequent sign must occur strictly after the previous one. For example, if the first sign occurs in year 3, the second sign must occur in a year strictly greater than 3, and so on.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes a list of characters (`path`) and computes a score based on the sequence of these characters.
   - It treats '@' as a positive increment and '*' as an invalid state.
   - The function uses dynamic programming to compute a score for the sequence.
   - This logic is entirely unrelated to the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign will occur based on their periodicity.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It assumes that each test case consists of a string (`path`) which is passed to `func_1`.
   - Since `func_1` does not solve the problem, calling it for each test case will not yield the correct results.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the occurrence of each sign based on its periodicity and ensure that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one. A possible solution involves iterating through the years and checking when each sign can occur next, keeping track of the current year as we go.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not address the problem correctly. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not implement the required logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities and the sequential occurrence condition.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
