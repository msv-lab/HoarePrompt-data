Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program seems to be designed for a different problem involving paths and symbols ('@' and '*'), rather than the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on their periodicities.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Misalignment with Problem Description**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur. Instead, they appear to be solving a different problem related to paths and scoring based on symbols.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in `func_1` involves dynamic programming to score a path based on the presence of '@' and '*' symbols. This logic is entirely unrelated to the problem of calculating the occurrence years of the signs of the apocalypse.

3. **Input Parsing Issues**: In `func_2`, the input parsing is incorrect for the given problem. The problem specifies that the input consists of multiple test cases, each with a number of signs `n` followed by a list of `n` integers representing the periodicities. However, the current implementation incorrectly treats the periodicities as a single string rather than a list of integers.

4. **Lack of Implementation for Core Problem**: There is no implementation in the provided code that calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to implement a function that iteratively calculates the year of each sign's occurrence based on its periodicity and the year the previous sign occurred. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(periodicities):
    current_year = 0
    for period in periodicities:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year
        next_occurrence = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
        current_year = next_occurrence
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periodicities = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periodicities))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version reads the input correctly, calculates the year of each sign's occurrence, and outputs the correct year for the n-th sign for each test case.
