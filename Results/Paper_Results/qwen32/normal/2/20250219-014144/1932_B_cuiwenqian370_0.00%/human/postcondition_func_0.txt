The function `func_1` takes a list of characters `path` as input, where each character is either '@' or '*'. It returns 0 if the list is empty. Otherwise, it calculates a score based on the sequence of characters, treating '@' as a positive increment and '*' as an invalid state, and returns the highest possible score achievable without encountering an invalid state.
