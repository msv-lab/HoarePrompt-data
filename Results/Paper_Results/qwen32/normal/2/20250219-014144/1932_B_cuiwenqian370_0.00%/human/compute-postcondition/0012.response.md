The code snippet updates the value of `n` by converting the string at the index specified by `index` in the `data` list to an integer. Given that `index` is 3, the value at `data[3]` is `'a_3'`. However, the problem statement specifies that `n` is the integer value of `a_2`, which means `n` should be derived from `data[1]` (since indexing starts at 0).

Since the problem statement indicates `n` is the integer value of `a_2`, and assuming `a_2` is a string representation of an integer, let's assume `data[1]` is something like `'2'`. Thus, `n` would be updated to the integer value of `data[1]`.

Given the initial state, `data[index]` is `'a_3'`, but `n` should be derived from `data[1]`. Let's assume `data[1]` is `'2'` for the sake of calculation.

Output State: **`path` is `'a_3'`; `data` is a list of strings `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`; `t` must be greater than 1; `index` is 3; `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1('a_3')`; `n` is the integer value of `a_2` (which is assumed to be 2 if `data[1]` is `'2'`).**
