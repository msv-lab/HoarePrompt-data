Output State: **`length` must be greater than 1. The current index `i` in the string `s` satisfies the condition where `s[i]` is equal to '0' and `s[i - 1]` is equal to '1'.**

Explanation: The character at index `i` in the string `s` was originally '-1', but it has been changed to '0'. The conditions regarding `length` and the value at `s[i - 1]` remain unchanged.
