Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all 30 iterations, `s` will be a list of 30 characters ('1' or '0'), representing the binary form of the integer `x`, with the least significant bit (rightmost) at index 0 and the most significant bit (leftmost) at index 29. The other variables (`t`, `nalla`, and `length`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
