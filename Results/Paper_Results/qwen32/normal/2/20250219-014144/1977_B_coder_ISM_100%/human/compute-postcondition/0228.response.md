Postcondition: **The list `s` will have all instances of consecutive `'1'`s transformed such that the first `'1'` in each pair is replaced by `'-1'`. Any `'0'` that follows a `'-1'` will be flipped to `'1'`. The rest of the elements will remain `'0'` or `'1'` based on the initial configuration and the described transformations. The variables `length`, `nalla`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged. If `flag` is `True` and `s[29]` is `'0'`, `s` has an extra element `'1'` at the end, and `length` is incremented by 1. If `flag` is `True` and `s[29]` is `'1'`, `s[29]` is also `'1'`. If `flag` is `False`, `s` remains as described in the precondition.**
