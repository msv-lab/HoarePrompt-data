Output State: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, each element being either `'1'` or `'0'`, representing the binary digits of the input integer `x` from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost). The values of `length`, `nalla`, and `t` remain unchanged, with `length` being 30, `nalla` being 3, and `t` being greater than 3. `x` remains an input integer.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all 30 iterations, the list `s` will have 30 characters, each being either `'1'` or `'0'`. These characters represent the binary form of the input integer `x`, starting from the least significant bit up to the 30th bit. The other variables (`length`, `nalla`, and `t`) stay the same as they were initially.
