The code appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing either one element '1' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or one element '0' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set, plus an additional '1' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or an additional '0' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set, and now includes an additional '1' at the end, `i` is incremented by 1.**
