Postcondition: **The list `s` contains either `['1', '1']`, `['0', '1']`, `['1', '0']`, or `['0', '0']` depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set to 1 or 0, respectively. The values of `length`, `nalla`, and `t` remain unchanged, with `length` being 30, `nalla` being 3, and `t` being greater than 3. `x` remains an input integer. `i` is incremented by 1.**
