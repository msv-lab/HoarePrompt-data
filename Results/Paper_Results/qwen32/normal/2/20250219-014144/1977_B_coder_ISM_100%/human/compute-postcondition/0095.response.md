Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `flag` is not 0 if the if condition is met, either `flag` is not 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'. If `(x & pow(2, i))` is true, `s` is now `['1', '1']` or `['0', '1']` depending on the initial value of `s`. Otherwise, `s` is `['1', '0']` or `['0', '0']` depending on the initial value of `s`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
