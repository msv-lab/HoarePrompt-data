The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means that `t` now holds the value of the input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The initial state mentioned that `t` was already an integer within this range, but now it specifically holds the value provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**.
