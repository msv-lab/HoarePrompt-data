The given code snippet initializes a variable `flag` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `x`, `nalla`, `length`, `s`) are modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, `flag` is 0.**
