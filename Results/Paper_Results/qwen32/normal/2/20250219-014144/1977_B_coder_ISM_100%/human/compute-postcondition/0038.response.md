Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, except `s[1]` which is now '1', `flag` is 0, `i` is 1**.

In simple terms, the value of `flag` has been set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
