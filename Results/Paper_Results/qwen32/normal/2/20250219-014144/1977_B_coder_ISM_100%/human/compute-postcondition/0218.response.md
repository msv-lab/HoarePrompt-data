Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, each being either `'1'` or `'0'`, except `s[0]` which could be `'-1'` if `flag` was 1 and `s[0]` was initially `'1'` and `s[1]` was `'1'`. If `flag` was 0 and `s[i]` was equal to `s[i + 1]` and both were `'1'`, then `s[1]` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s[1]` remains `'0'` if `flag` was 1, and `flag` remains unchanged. The variable `length` is 30, `nalla` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `x` is an input integer, and `i` is 2. If `flag` was 0 and `s[i]` was equal to `s[i + 1]` and both were `'1'`, then `s[2]` is now `'-1'` and `flag` is 1. If `flag` was 1 and `s[i]` was `'0'`, then `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.**
