Postcondition: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is the input integer, `nalla` is not yet initialized, `length` is 30, `i` is 2. If `flag` was initially 1, then `s` is a list of 30 elements where the third element is '0' and others remain unchanged based on the initial conditions. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where each element is '1' if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or '0' if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set, with modifications based on the initial `flag` value as described in the precondition.**
