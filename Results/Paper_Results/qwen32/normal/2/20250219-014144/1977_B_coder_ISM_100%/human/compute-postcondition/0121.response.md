The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` modifies the list `s` at index `i` by setting its value to `'-1'`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, `nalla`, `length`, `flag`, or `i`.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the element at index `i` in the list `s` is now `'-1'`.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 characters representing the binary form of `x` except `s[i]` is now `'-1'`, `flag` is either 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions, `i` is `i + 1` where 0 ≤ `i` < 28.**
