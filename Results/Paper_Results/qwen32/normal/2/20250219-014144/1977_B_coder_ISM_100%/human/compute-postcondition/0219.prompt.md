Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list `s` contains 30 elements, each element being either `'1'` or `'0'`, representing the binary digits of the input integer `x` from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost). The values of `length`, `nalla`, and `t` remain unchanged, with `length` being 30, `nalla` being 3, and `t` being greater than 3. `x` remains an input integer. `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The list `s` contains 30 elements, each being either `'1'` or `'0'`, except possibly `s[0]` which could be `'-1'` if `flag` was 1 and `s[0]` was initially `'1'` and `s[1]` was `'1'`. The variable `length` is 30, `nalla` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `x` is an input integer, and `i` is 0. If `flag` was 0, no changes occur to `s`, `flag`, or `i`. If `flag` was 1 and `s[0]` was `'1'` and `s[1]` was `'1'`, then `s[0]` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0 and no changes occur to `s` or `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `s` contains 30 elements, each being either `'1'` or `'0'`, except `s[0]` which could be `'-1'` if `flag` was 1 and `s[0]` was initially `'1'` and `s[1]` was `'1'`. If `flag` was 0 and `s[i]` was equal to `s[i + 1]` and both were `'1'`, then `s[1]` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s[1]` remains `'0'` if `flag` was 1, and `flag` remains unchanged. The variable `length` is 30, `nalla` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `x` is an input integer, and `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The list `s` contains 30 elements, each being either `'1'` or `'0'`, except `s[0]` which could be `'-1'` if `flag` was 1 and `s[0]` was initially `'1'` and `s[1]` was `'1'`. If `flag` was 0 and `s[i]` was equal to `s[i + 1]` and both were `'1'`, then `s[1]` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s[1]` remains `'0'` if `flag` was 1, and `flag` remains unchanged. The variable `length` is 30, `nalla` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `x` is an input integer, and `i` is 2. If `flag` was 0 and `s[i]` was equal to `s[i + 1]` and both were `'1'`, then `s[2]` is now `'-1'` and `flag` is 1. If `flag` was 1 and `s[i]` was `'0'`, then `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
