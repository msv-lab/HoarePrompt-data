The code snippet `s[i] = '0'` modifies the list `s` by setting the element at index `i` to the string `'0'`. The initial state specifies that `length` is greater than 1 and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. This means that `i` now points to a valid index within the list `s`.

Given these conditions, the only change is the value at index `i` in the list `s`, which is set to `'0'`. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`length` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `s[i]` is `'0'`**.
