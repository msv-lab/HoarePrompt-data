The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count at the index specified by the value of `c` in the list `cnt`. Given the initial state, `c` can be either 0 or 1. 

- If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1.

Since `cnt` is initially `[1+1, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[1, 0+1]` if `c` is 1, we need to adjust these based on the value of `c`.

- If `c` is 0, `cnt` was initially `[2, 0]`, and after incrementing `cnt[0]`, it becomes `[3, 0]`.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt` was initially `[1, 1]`, and after incrementing `cnt[1]`, it becomes `[1, 2]`.

Other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`, `cnt` is `[3, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[1, 2]` if `c` is 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
