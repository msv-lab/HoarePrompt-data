Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's) with length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5. The sum of the lengths of all strings s over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, s is a list of integers (0s and 1s), n is greater than 0, zeroes is the count of 0s in the list s, cnt is [zeroes, ones], and ans is zeroes * ones.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers (0s and 1s) from the input, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the current list `s`, `cnt` is `[number_of_0s_in_s, number_of_1s_in_s]`, and `ans` is the total score calculated based on the described rules.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cnt` is `[zeroes, n - zeroes]`, `ans` is the accumulated result based on the loop's logic.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
