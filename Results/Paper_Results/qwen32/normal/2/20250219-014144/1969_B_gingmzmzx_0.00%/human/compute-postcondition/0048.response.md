To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it doesn't directly influence the calculation of `ans` in a single execution context.
   
2. **`s`**: A list of integers consisting of 0s and 1s. This list is the primary input for calculating `ans`.

3. **`n`**: An integer greater than 1. It likely represents the length of the list `s`, but this is not explicitly stated. For the purpose of this explanation, we'll assume `n = len(s)`.

4. **`zeroes`**: The count of 0s in the list `s`. This is calculated as `zeroes = s.count(0)`.

5. **`cnt`**: A list containing two elements: the number of 0s and the number of 1s in the list `s`. This is calculated as `cnt = [s.count(0), s.count(1)]`.

6. **`ans`**: The total score calculated based on the described rules. Since the specific rules for calculating `ans` are not provided, we can only infer that `ans` is derived from the counts of 0s and 1s in the list `s`.

Given these details, the `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is calculated based on the counts of 0s and 1s in the list `s`.

Since the exact rules for calculating `ans` are not specified, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the counts of 0s and 1s in the list `s`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total score calculated based on the counts of 0s and 1s in the list `s`)**
