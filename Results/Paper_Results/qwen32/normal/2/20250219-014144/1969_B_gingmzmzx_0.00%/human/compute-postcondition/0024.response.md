Let's break down the given initial state and determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `s` is a list of integers containing only 0s and 1s.
- `n` is greater than 0. This variable `n` is also not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`.
- `cnt` is a list containing two elements: `[zeroes, ones]`, where `ones` is the count of 1s in the list `s`.
- `ans` is calculated as `zeroes * ones`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
Given that `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s` and `ones` is the count of 1s in the list `s`, `ans` is simply the product of these two counts.

### Print Statement:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in the list `s`.

### Final Output Description:
The output will be the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in the list `s`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the product of the number of 0s and the number of 1s in the list `s`)**
