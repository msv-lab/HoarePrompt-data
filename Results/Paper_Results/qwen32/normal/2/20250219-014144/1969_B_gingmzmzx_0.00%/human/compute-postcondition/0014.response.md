The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count at the index `c` in the list `cnt`. Given that `c` is the next element in the list `s` and can only be 0 or 1, this operation will increase either `cnt[0]` or `cnt[1]` by 1.

- If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` will be incremented by 1.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` will be incremented by 1.

Since `cnt` is initialized as `[1, 0]` if `c` is 0, or `[0, 1]` if `c` is 1, the updated `cnt` will reflect this increment.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `c` is 0:
   - `cnt` was `[1, 0]`.
   - After `cnt[c] += 1`, `cnt` becomes `[2, 0]`.

2. If `c` is 1:
   - `cnt` was `[0, 1]`.
   - After `cnt[c] += 1`, `cnt` becomes `[0, 2]`.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[2, 0]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[0, 2]`, and `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
