The code snippet checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Since `cnt` is initialized as `[1, 0]`, `cnt[1]` is 0. Therefore, the condition `cnt[1] > 0` is false, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) with at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [1, 0], `ans` is 0, and `c` is 0.**
