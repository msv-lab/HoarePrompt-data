You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and computes a value `ans` based on the counts of '0's and '1's in the string. It then prints the computed `ans` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `k` is `k`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. Converts the binary string into a list of integers.
2. Counts the total number of zeros in the string.
3. Initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeros and ones encountered so far.
4. Iterates through the string and updates the counters.
5. Calculates the cost incrementally:
   - If the current character is '0', it adds 1 to the answer if there has been at least one '1' encountered before.
   - If the current character is '1', it adds the remaining number of zeros (total zeros minus the count of zeros seen so far) to the answer.

### Key Points to Check:
- The program should correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.
- The cost calculation seems to be based on the idea that each '1' encountered after a '0' needs to be shifted past the '0's, contributing to the cost.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the example provided in the problem statement:

#### Example Test Case:
```
5
10
0000
11000
101011
01101001
```

#### Expected Output:
```
2
0
9
5
11
```

#### Program Output:
Let's manually check the logic for the first test case:
- String: "10"
- Total zeros: 1
- Iteration:
  - First character '1': `cnt[1] = 1`, `ans = 0` (since no '0' encountered yet).
  - Second character '0': `cnt[0] = 1`, `ans += 1` (since `cnt[1] > 0`).
- Final `ans = 2`, which matches the expected output.

We can similarly verify the other test cases, and the program seems to produce the correct results.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and verification, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.
