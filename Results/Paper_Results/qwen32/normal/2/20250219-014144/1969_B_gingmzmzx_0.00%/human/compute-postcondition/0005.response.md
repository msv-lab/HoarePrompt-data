The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `ans` with the value `0`. This does not affect any of the existing variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`). Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the addition of the new variable `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers (0s and 1s) corresponding to the binary string input, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0.**
