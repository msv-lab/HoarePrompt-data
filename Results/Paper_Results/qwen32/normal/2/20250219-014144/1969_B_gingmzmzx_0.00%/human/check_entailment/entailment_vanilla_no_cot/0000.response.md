Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shift operation. The logic in the program does not account for the actual cost of performing the cyclic shifts, which is the length of the chosen substring. Instead, it seems to be counting transitions between '0's and '1's, which does not directly translate to the required cost calculation.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to consider how to optimally perform the cyclic shifts to sort the string with minimal cost, taking into account the actual lengths of the substrings being shifted. The current implementation does not address this aspect and thus is incorrect for the given problem statement.
