To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains `i` and the length of `nums`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input
- `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]
- `idx` is -1
- `i` is 0

The loop iterates over the indices of `nums` using `range(len(nums))`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Since `nums` is a predefined list and its length does not change, there is no need to adjust the state of `nums` or its length. The variable `t`, `n`, `k`, and `idx` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]; `idx` is -1; `i` is 1**
