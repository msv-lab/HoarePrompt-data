### Reasoning:

The program aims to generate a sequence of integers that satisfies two conditions for each test case:
1. There is no subsequence of the sequence that sums to `k`.
2. For all values `v` in the range `[1, n]` except `k`, there is a subsequence of the sequence that sums to `v`.

The program constructs a sequence starting with the first 21 powers of 2 (`1, 2, 4, ..., 2^20`). This set of numbers allows us to form any sum up to `2^21 - 1` using different combinations of these numbers. However, since `n` can be as large as `10^6`, which is much larger than `2^21 - 1`, the initial sequence alone is insufficient.

To address this, the program identifies the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and removes it from the sequence. It then adds three new numbers to the sequence:
- `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the exact sum `k` cannot be formed.
- `k + 1`: This allows the formation of sums greater than `k` by including `k + 1` in subsequences.
- `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This further helps in forming more sums beyond `k`.

However, the current implementation has some issues:
- The sequence generated might still allow forming the sum `k` due to the way the new elements are added.
- The removal of `nums[idx]` and addition of new elements might not ensure that all sums up to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.

Let's consider the test cases:
- For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the output is `1\n1`, which is correct because the only possible sum is `1`.
- For `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the output is `5\n2 3 4 5 6`, which is incorrect because it includes `1` which is not allowed.
- For `n = 8` and `k = 8`, the output is `7\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1`, which is incorrect because it does not prevent forming the sum `8`.
- For `n = 9` and `k = 3`, the output is `4\n7 1 4 1`, which might not cover all sums up to `9` except `3`.
- For `n = 10` and `k = 7`, the output is `4\n1 2 8 3`, which might not cover all sums up to `10` except `7`.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly handle all cases, especially ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums up to `n`.
