To determine the output of the `print(*nums)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `nums` list step-by-step:

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- `nums` is a list constructed based on specific rules:
  - It starts with the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
  - It then adds `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the end of the list.
  - The element `2^idx` is removed from the list.
- `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k`, or `-1` if no such index exists.

### Construction of `nums`:
1. **Base Sequence**: Start with the predefined list of powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\).
2. **Determine `idx`**:
   - Find the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k`.
   - If no such index exists (i.e., `k` is less than 1), `idx` is set to `-1`.
3. **Modify the List**:
   - Remove the element at index `idx` (if `idx` is not `-1`).
   - Append `k + 1` to the list.
   - Append `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list (if `idx` is not `-1`).

### Output Analysis:
Given the above steps, the final `nums` list will be:
- The original list of powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\) with one element removed.
- Followed by `k + 1`.
- Optionally followed by `k + nums[idx] + 1` if `idx` is not `-1`.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's assume `k = 100` for illustration:
- The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 100 is 64, so `idx = 6` (since \(2^6 = 64\)).
- Remove `64` from the list.
- Append `101` (`k + 1`).
- Append `165` (`k + nums[idx] + 1 = 100 + 64 + 1`).

Thus, the final `nums` list would be:
\[ [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 101, 165] \]

### General Output:
The `print(*nums)` statement will print all elements of the modified `nums` list separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 4 8 16 32 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 [k + 1] ([k + nums[idx] + 1] if idx != -1) (where nums is the list after removing 2^idx and adding k + 1 and optionally k + nums[idx] + 1)**
