To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- `nums` is a predefined list of powers of 2.
- `idx` is either 0 (if `nums[i] > k` was encountered) or -1 (otherwise).
- `i` is the current index in the `nums` list.

Since the loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Let's summarize the adjustments needed:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next element in the `nums` list.
- Other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `idx`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is either 0 or -1, `i` is incremented by 1**
