The loop runs for `j` in the range of 2, meaning it will execute exactly 2 times. The provided output states already cover the conditions and results after the first 3 iterations, but since the loop only runs 2 times, we will focus on the state after 2 iterations.

From the given information:
- After the first iteration, `arr` can contain `[1]` or `[26]` depending on the value of `lex`.
- After the second iteration, `arr` can contain `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, or `[26, 26]` depending on the value of `lex`.

Since the loop runs only 2 times, the final state will be the state after the second iteration.

**Output State: [1, 1]** if `lex` was originally less than 26.
**Output State: [26, 1]** if `lex` was between 1 and 51 inclusive or between 52 and 77.
**Output State: [1, 26]** if `lex` was originally less than 26.
**Output State: [26, 26]** if `lex` was between 2 and 52 inclusive or between 53 and 78.

However, since the loop runs exactly 2 times, we can summarize the final state as follows:

If `lex` was originally less than 26, `arr` will be `[1, 1]` and `lex` will be `lex - 2`.
If `lex` was between 26 and 51, `arr` will be `[26, 1]` and `lex` will be `lex - 27`.
If `lex` was between 52 and 77, `arr` will be `[26, 26]` and `lex` will be `lex - 52`.
If `lex` was greater than 77, `arr` will be `[26, 26]` and `lex` will be `lex - 52`.

Given the loop runs exactly 2 times, the final state simplifies to:

**Output State: [1, 1]** if `lex` was originally less than 26.
**Output State: [26, 1]** if `lex` was between 26 and 51.
**Output State: [26, 26]** if `lex` was between 52 and 78.

Since the exact value of `lex` is not specified beyond these ranges, we can provide a general output state based on the conditions.

Output State: **[1, 1] if lex was originally less than 26, [26, 1] if lex was between 26 and 51, [26, 26] if lex was between 52 and 78.**

For simplicity and based on the most common scenario where `lex` could be any value leading to the most frequent outcomes, we can generalize the final output state as:

Output State: **[26, 26]**

This is because the range where `lex` leads to `[26, 26]` (between 52 and 78) is the largest among the given conditions.

Output State: **[26, 26]**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations (which is 2 times), the final state of `arr` will be `[26, 26]` if `lex` was originally between 52 and 78. If `lex` was originally less than 26, `arr` would be `[1, 1]`, and if `lex` was between 26 and 51, `arr` would be `[26, 1]`. However, without a specific value for `lex`, the most common and generalized final state is `[26, 26]`.
