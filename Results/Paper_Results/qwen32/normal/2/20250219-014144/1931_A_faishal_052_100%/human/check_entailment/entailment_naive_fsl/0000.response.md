Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n` within the specified range (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Logic for Determining Letters**: The code attempts to determine the letters by checking if the remaining value (`lex`) is less than 28, 52, or 78. This logic is flawed because it doesn't properly distribute the remaining value among the three letters to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, when `n` is 3, the correct output should be "aaa", but the current logic might not produce this result.

3. **Sorting**: The code sorts the array of letter values before converting them to characters. While sorting ensures the smallest lexicographical order, the initial distribution of values is incorrect, leading to wrong results.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

- **Test Case**: `n = 3`
  - Expected Output: "aaa"
  - Current Code Output: Incorrect (likely "aab" or similar)

To fix the code, we need to correctly distribute the value of `n` among the three letters such that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters
        a = b = c = 1
        n -= 3  # Subtract the base value for 'aaa'
        
        # Distribute the remaining value to make the word lexicographically smallest
        if n > 0:
            c += min(25, n)
            n -= min(25, n)
        if n > 0:
            b += min(25, n)
            n -= min(25, n)
        if n > 0:
            a += min(25, n)
            n -= min(25, n)
        
        # Convert to letters
        result = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the remaining value is distributed correctly among the three letters, maintaining the smallest lexicographical order.
