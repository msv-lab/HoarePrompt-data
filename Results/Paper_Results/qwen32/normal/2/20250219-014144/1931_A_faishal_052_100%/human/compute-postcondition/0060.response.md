Postcondition: **`arr` is a list that contains the integer `26` if `lex` is between 2 and 52 inclusive, and an empty list if `lex` is greater than 78. If `lex` is between 53 and 78, `arr` is also a list containing the integer `26`. `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 28, `info` contains an empty list as its last element, `i` is `x + 1`, and `cases` remains unchanged.**
