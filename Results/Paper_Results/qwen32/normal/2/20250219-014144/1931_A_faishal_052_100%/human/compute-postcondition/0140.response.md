The code snippet assigns an empty string to the variable `temp`. This means that the previous value of `temp`, which was constructed from characters corresponding to the values in `info[0]`, is replaced by an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `temp` is ''; `j` is 2**.
