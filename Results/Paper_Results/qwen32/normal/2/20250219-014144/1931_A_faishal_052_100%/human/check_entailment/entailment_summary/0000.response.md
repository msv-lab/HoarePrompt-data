### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex`, which represents the encoded word.

2. **Generating the Lexicographically Smallest Word:**
   - The program aims to generate the lexicographically smallest word that sums up to `lex`.
   - The logic used in the program is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly determine the smallest possible letters for the given sum.
   - The program tries to append either `1` or `26` to the array `arr` based on the value of `lex`. This approach is incorrect because it doesn't ensure that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest.
   - After appending values to `arr`, it sorts the array. However, sorting alone does not guarantee the smallest lexicographical order when constructing the word from the sum.

3. **Constructing the Output:**
   - The program converts the numbers in `arr` to their corresponding characters by adding `96` (since `chr(97)` is 'a').
   - It then prints the constructed word.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the first test case from the example:

- **Input:** `24`
- **Expected Output:** `aav`
- **Actual Output:** The program might output something different due to the flawed logic.

The expected output `aav` is derived by starting with the smallest possible letters and adjusting them to reach the sum of `24`. The program's current logic does not guarantee this result.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
