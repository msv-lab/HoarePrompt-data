The code snippet provided is `lex = lex - 1`. This means the value of the variable `lex` is being decremented by 1. However, the initial state does not specify the initial value of `lex`. Since `lex` is not mentioned in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value before the operation. We only know that after the operation, `lex` will be 1 less than whatever its initial value was.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `cases`, `j`, and `arr`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `arr` has `1` appended to it, `lex` is decreased by 1 from its initial value.**
