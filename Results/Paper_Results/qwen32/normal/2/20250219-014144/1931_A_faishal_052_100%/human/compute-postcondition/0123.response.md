Postcondition: **`arr` is either `[]`, `[1]`, `[26]`, `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, or `[26, 26]`. `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element. `i` is 4. `j` is 2. If `lex` was initially less than 28, `lex` is decreased by 1. If `lex` was initially 28 or greater but less than 52, `lex` is decreased by 26. If `lex` was initially 52 or greater but less than or equal to 78, `lex` is decreased by 26. If `lex` was initially greater than 78, `lex` remains unchanged.**
