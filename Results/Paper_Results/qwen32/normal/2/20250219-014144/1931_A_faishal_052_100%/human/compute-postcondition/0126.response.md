The `arr.sort()` command sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Given the initial state of `arr` as `[1, 1, lex_value]`, after sorting, the first two elements remain `1` and `1`. The position of `lex_value` depends on its value relative to `1`.

- If `lex_value` is less than or equal to `1`, `arr` becomes `[lex_value, 1, 1]`.
- If `lex_value` is greater than `1`, `arr` becomes `[1, 1, lex_value]`.

Since the exact value of `lex_value` is not specified, we consider both possibilities. The other variables (`info` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is either `[lex_value, 1, 1]` if `lex_value` is less than or equal to `1`, or `[1, 1, lex_value]` if `lex_value` is greater than `1`; `info` includes `[26, 26, 25]` as its last element; `i` is 4.**
