Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each test case, `n`, which is an integer representing some value (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the value of `n` for each test case.**
