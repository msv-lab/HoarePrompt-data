The code snippet provided modifies the variable `lex` by subtracting 26 from its current value. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `lex`, we can only express the new value of `lex` in terms of its original value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `arr` contains `26` appended to it, `lex` is `lex - 26`.**
