Postcondition: **`arr` is an empty list if `lex` is greater than 78; otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the single element 26. `lex` is an input integer greater than or equal to 52, and if `lex` is between 26 and 52 inclusive, it satisfies the condition of the if part. `info` contains an empty list as its last element, `i` is `x + 1`, and `cases` remains unchanged.**
