Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is an empty list, `lex` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 28. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` is [26]. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 if `lex` is greater than or equal to 26 and less than or equal to 52, otherwise `arr` remains an empty list.**
