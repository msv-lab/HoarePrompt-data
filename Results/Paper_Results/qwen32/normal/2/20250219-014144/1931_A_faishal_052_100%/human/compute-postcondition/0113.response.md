Postcondition: **`arr` is either `[]`, `[1]`, `[26]`, `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, or `[1, 26]`, `[26, 26]`; `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element; `i` is 4; `lex` is an integer. If `lex` was less than 27, `arr` is `[1]` if `lex - 1` is less than 27, `[26, 1]` if `lex - 1` is between 28 and 51 inclusive, and `[1]` if `lex - 1` is 27 or greater than or equal to 52. If `lex` was 27, `arr` is `[1, 26]` and `lex` is now 1. If `lex` was between 28 and 51 inclusive, `arr` is `[26]` and `lex` is now between 2 and 25 inclusive. If `lex` was 52, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now 26. If `lex` is greater than 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now between 27 and 52 inclusive. If `lex` is greater than 78, the state remains unchanged from the precondition; `j` is 1.**
