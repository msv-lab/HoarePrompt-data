The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `cases`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `temp` is the character corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96` concatenated with the character corresponding to `info[1][1] + 96` and then concatenated with the character corresponding to `info[1][2] + 96`; `j` is 2**.

However, note that `temp` and `j` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted according to the loop's logic. Therefore, the relevant state adjustment is only for `i`.

Final State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2**.
