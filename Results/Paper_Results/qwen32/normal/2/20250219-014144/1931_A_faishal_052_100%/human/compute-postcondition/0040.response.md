To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions. The loop runs for `j` in the range of 2, meaning it will execute exactly 2 times (for `j = 0` and `j = 1`). Let's break down the loop's behavior step-by-step:

### Loop Execution Breakdown

1. **First Iteration (`j = 0`)**:
   - If `lex < 28`, append `1` to `arr` and decrease `lex` by `1`.
   - If `28 <= lex < 52`, append `26` to `arr` and decrease `lex` by `26`.
   - If `52 <= lex <= 78`, append `26` to `arr` and decrease `lex` by `26`.

2. **Second Iteration (`j = 1`)**:
   - Apply the same logic as above to the updated `lex` value from the first iteration.

### Final Output State

After the loop completes both iterations, the final state of `arr` and `lex` will depend on the initial value of `lex`. Here's how it breaks down:

- **If `lex < 28` initially**:
  - After the first iteration, `arr` becomes `[1]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 1`.
  - For the second iteration, since `lex - 1 < 27`, `arr` becomes `[1, 1]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 2`.

- **If `28 <= lex < 52` initially**:
  - After the first iteration, `arr` becomes `[26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 26`.
  - For the second iteration, since `lex - 26 < 26`, `arr` becomes `[26, 1]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 27`.

- **If `52 <= lex <= 78` initially**:
  - After the first iteration, `arr` becomes `[26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 26`.
  - For the second iteration, since `26 <= lex - 26 <= 52`, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 52`.

### Conclusion

The final state of `arr` and `lex` after the loop completes depends on the initial value of `lex`. However, the state of `t`, `n`, `cases`, and `info` remains unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

**Output State:** **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `info` is an empty list, and `arr` and `lex` are determined by the initial value of `lex` as described above.**

In simpler terms, the final state of `arr` and `lex` will be:
- If `lex < 28`, `arr` is `[1, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 2`.
- If `28 <= lex < 52`, `arr` is `[26, 1]` and `lex` is `lex - 27`.
- If `52 <= lex <= 78`, `arr` is `[26, 26]` and `lex` is `lex - 52`.
