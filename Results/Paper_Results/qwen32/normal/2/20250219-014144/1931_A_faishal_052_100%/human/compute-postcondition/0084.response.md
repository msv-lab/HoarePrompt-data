The `sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Given the initial state of `arr` as `[26, 26, lex]`, the sorted list will have the two integers first followed by the string `lex`. Therefore, the sorted array will be `[26, 26, lex]` if `lex` is lexicographically larger than `26` (which is always true since `lex` is a string and `26` is an integer). 

Output State: **`arr` is `[26, 26, lex]`**
