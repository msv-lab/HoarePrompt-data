You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.

    #State: `info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` remains unchanged; `i` equals `cases`.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: `info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` remains unchanged; `i` equals `cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `cases` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` and generates a string of three characters based on the value of `lex`. It then prints these strings. The values of `t` and `n` mentioned in the annotations are not parameters of the function and do not affect its behavior.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n` within the specified range (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Logic for Determining Letters**: The code attempts to determine the letters by checking if the remaining value (`lex`) is less than 28, 52, or 78. This logic is flawed because it doesn't properly distribute the remaining value among the three letters to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, when `n` is 3, the correct output should be "aaa", but the current logic might not produce this result.

3. **Sorting**: The code sorts the array of letter values before converting them to characters. While sorting ensures the smallest lexicographical order, the initial distribution of values is incorrect, leading to wrong results.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

- **Test Case**: `n = 3`
  - Expected Output: "aaa"
  - Current Code Output: Incorrect (likely "aab" or similar)

To fix the code, we need to correctly distribute the value of `n` among the three letters such that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters
        a = b = c = 1
        n -= 3  # Subtract the base value for 'aaa'
        
        # Distribute the remaining value to make the word lexicographically smallest
        if n > 0:
            c += min(25, n)
            n -= min(25, n)
        if n > 0:
            b += min(25, n)
            n -= min(25, n)
        if n > 0:
            a += min(25, n)
            n -= min(25, n)
        
        # Convert to letters
        result = chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96)
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the remaining value is distributed correctly among the three letters, maintaining the smallest lexicographical order.
