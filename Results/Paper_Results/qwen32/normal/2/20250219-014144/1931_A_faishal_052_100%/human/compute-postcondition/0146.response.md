The code appends the character corresponding to `info[i][j] + 96` to the existing `temp`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, so `temp` will be updated by appending the character corresponding to `info[1][2] + 96`.

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `temp` is the character corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96` concatenated with the character corresponding to `info[1][1] + 96` and then concatenated with the character corresponding to `info[1][2] + 96`; `j` is 2.**
