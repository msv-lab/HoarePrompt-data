The code appends the character corresponding to `chr(info[0][1] + 96)` to the existing `temp` string. Given the initial state, `temp` initially contains the character corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)`. After the code executes, `temp` will contain both characters.

Output State: **`info` contains `cases` number of sorted arrays, each generated based on the corresponding `lex` value; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; `cases` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)` and `chr(info[0][1] + 96)`; `j` is 1**.
