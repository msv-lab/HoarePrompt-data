Postcondition: **`arr` is either `[]`, `[1]`, `[26]`, `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, or `[26, 26]`. `info` includes `[26, 26, lex]` as its last element. `i` is 4. If `lex` was initially less than 52, `lex` is decreased by 26. If `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 52 but less than or equal to 78, `lex` is decreased by 26. Otherwise, `lex` remains unchanged. `j` is 2.**
