Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The problem description asks for a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` that processes directories and generates specific files based on the presence of `.html` files within those directories. However, the given code defines a completely different function `func_1` that reads input values and performs a check related to the count of '1's in a string, which has no relation to the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
