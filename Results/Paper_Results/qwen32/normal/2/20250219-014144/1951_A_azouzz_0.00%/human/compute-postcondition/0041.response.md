It appears there was a slight misunderstanding in the provided function definition. The function `func_1()` does not accept any parameters according to the given code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it seems like the function should accept two parameters, `start` and `end`.

Let's correct this and provide the functionality description:

Parameter constraints: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.
```
def func_1(start, end):
```

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are integers such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`. The function returns a list of integers from `start` to `end` inclusive.**
