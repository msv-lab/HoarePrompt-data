Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1; `n` is the new integer input by the user; `s` is the new string input by the user; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`. Whether '11' is in `s` or not, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain as described.**
