Output State: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, with `u` appended to the list of integers for key `v`; `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, `n` must be at least 2, `t` is the second integer read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `i` is 2; `u` and `v` are updated to the integers read from the input.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `v` has been appended to the list associated with the key `u` in the `nodes` defaultdict. All other variables retain their initial values.
