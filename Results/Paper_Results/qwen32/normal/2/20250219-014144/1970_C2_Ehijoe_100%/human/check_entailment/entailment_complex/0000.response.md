### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game played on a tree structure, where players take turns moving a stone from one node to another along the edges of the tree. The player who cannot make a move loses. The game is played optimally by both players.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` is a recursive function that checks if there is a way to force a win for the player whose turn it is.
- It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore the tree.
- The function returns `False` if the current node is a leaf node (i.e., it has no children other than its parent).
- For non-leaf nodes, it recursively calls itself on each child node and collects results in the `distances` list. Each result is negated (`not func_1(nodes, node, start)`), meaning if a child node can force a win for the opponent, the current node can force a win for the player.
- The function returns `True` if at least one of the child nodes can force a win for the player, indicating that the player can make a move that leads to a winning position.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` reads the input to construct the tree.
- It identifies all leaf nodes and stores them in a deque called `leaves`.
- It reads the starting node for the game.
- It calls `func_1` with the starting node and the constructed tree to determine if the starting player (Ron) can force a win.
- Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints "Ron" if Ron can force a win, otherwise it prints "Hermione".

#### Correctness:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the DFS approach to determine if the starting player can force a win.
- The base case correctly identifies leaf nodes, which are losing positions for the player whose turn it is.
- The recursive case correctly checks all possible moves and determines if any of them lead to a winning position.
- The main function `func_2` correctly constructs the tree and uses `func_1` to determine the winner based on the starting node.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the program correctly determines the winner of the game for each round based on the optimal play by both players.

### Correctness: **True**
