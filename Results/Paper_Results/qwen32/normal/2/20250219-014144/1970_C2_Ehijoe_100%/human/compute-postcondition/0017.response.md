The given Python code snippet initializes a `deque` named `leaves`. This operation does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`). The only change is the introduction of the new variable `leaves`, which is an empty `deque`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` where each key is a node and the value is a list of adjacent nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, `t` is the second integer read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `leaves` is an empty `deque`.**
