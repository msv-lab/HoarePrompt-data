You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
    else:
        s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
        x = n - 1
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
    print(s, sep='')
    print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads a test case consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It processes these strings to produce a new string `s` which is a concatenation of parts of the input strings, and an integer `t`. The function prints the string `s` and the integer `t`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for finding the lexicographically smallest string and counting the number of paths that yield this string. Let's analyze the code and provide a counterexample:

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Path Construction**:
   - The code attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest string by comparing adjacent elements in both rows and deciding the path based on these comparisons.
   - However, the logic for constructing the string `s` and the count `t` is flawed and does not cover all scenarios.

2. **Counting Paths**:
   - The logic for counting the number of paths (`t`) that yield the lexicographically smallest string is incorrect. The loop that calculates `t` does not properly account for all possible paths that could lead to the smallest string.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following input:

```
1
5
01010
10101
```

#### Expected Output:
- Lexicographically smallest string: `00000`
- Number of paths: `1`

#### Actual Output from the Program:
- Lexicographically smallest string: `01010`
- Number of paths: `1`

#### Explanation of the Issue:
- The program incorrectly constructs the string `s` by making decisions based on the first occurrence of a specific pattern (`a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` or `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`).
- In the provided counterexample, the program does not explore the possibility of taking the lower path initially and then switching to the upper path later to form the smallest string `00000`.
- The count of paths (`t`) is also incorrect because the program does not correctly enumerate all valid paths that produce the smallest string.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle certain cases correctly, particularly those where the optimal path involves switching between rows at different points. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
