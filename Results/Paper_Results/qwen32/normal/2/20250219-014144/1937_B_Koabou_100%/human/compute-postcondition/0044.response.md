The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `y`, `i`, or `t`. It only terminates the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. Therefore, the values of `y`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `y` must be less than `x`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `t` is `x - (i + 1) + 1`

Since no changes are made to these variables due to the `break` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`y` must be less than `x`, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is `x - (i + 1) + 1`**
