Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing two elements where the first element `n` is at least 2, and the second element is a binary string of length `n`. `s` remains as it was, `x` remains as it was, `i` is 1. If `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'`, then `y` is 1. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.**
