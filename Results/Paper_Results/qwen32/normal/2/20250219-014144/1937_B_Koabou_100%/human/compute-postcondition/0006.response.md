The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as an iteration counter. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than 2. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given this information, here's the adjusted state:

State: **`a` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), and the second element is a binary string of length `n`; `_` is 2**
