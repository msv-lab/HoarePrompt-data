Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `s` is defined as `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`.
- `x` is defined as `n - 1`.
- `y` is defined as the last index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0'` and `a[1][i] == '1'`.
- `t` is defined as `1`.

### Given Code Snippet:
```python
print(s, sep='')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the variable `s` with `sep=''`, but since `s` is a single string, the `sep` parameter does not affect the output.
- To determine the value of `s`, we need to understand the components `a[0]` and `a[1][n - 1]`.
- `a` is presumably a list of strings or lists, and `n` is the length of `a[1]`.

However, the exact values of `a`, `n`, and the specific indices involved in defining `s` are not provided. Therefore, we can only describe `s` in terms of these variables.

### Value of `s`:
- `s` is constructed from two parts:
  - `a[0]`: This is the first element of the list `a`.
  - `a[1][n - 1]`: This is the last element of the second element of the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Given the lack of specific values for `a` and `n`, the output can only be described in terms of these variables.

Output: **a[0]a[1][n - 1] (where a[0] is the first element of the list a and a[1][n - 1] is the last element of the second element of the list a)**
