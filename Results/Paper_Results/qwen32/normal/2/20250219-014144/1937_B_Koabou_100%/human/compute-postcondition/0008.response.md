To determine the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the list `a`. The loop runs for a fixed number of times, specifically 2 times as indicated by `for _ in range(2):`.

Here's the breakdown of the loop's behavior:
- In the first iteration (`_ = 0`), the first input line (which is the integer `n`) is appended to `a`.
- In the second iteration (`_ = 1`), the second input line (which is the first binary string of length `n`) is appended to `a`.

After these two iterations, the loop terminates because the range is set to 2. Therefore, no further iterations occur, and no additional input lines are read or appended to `a`.

Thus, the final state of `a` will be a list containing exactly two elements:
1. The first element is the integer `n`.
2. The second element is the first binary string of length `n`.

The third input line (the second binary string) is not read or processed by the loop because the loop only runs twice.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:

Output State: **a is a list containing two elements: the first element is the integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), and the second element is a binary string of length `n`.**
