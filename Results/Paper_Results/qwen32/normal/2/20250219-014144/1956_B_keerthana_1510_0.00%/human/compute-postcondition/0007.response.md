Output State: **The input file has at least three lines, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), the second line contains `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and the third line exists and is properly formatted. `elements` is a list of strings representing the substrings from `line` split by whitespace.**

Explanation: The variable `elements` is now a list of strings obtained by splitting the `line` string by whitespace. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
