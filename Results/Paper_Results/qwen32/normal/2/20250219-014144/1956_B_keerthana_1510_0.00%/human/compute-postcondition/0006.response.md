To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head: `line`.

Given the loop:
```python
for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here's the breakdown:
- The loop iterates over every second line starting from the third line (`[2::2]`) of the input file.
- `line` is the current line being processed.

From the state description:
- The input file has at least three lines.
- The first line contains an integer `n`.
- The second line contains `n` integers.
- The third line exists and is properly formatted.
- `elements` is a list of strings representing the substrings from `line` split by whitespace.
- `line` is the line at position `k+2` in the input file.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- The current `line` is at position `k+2`.
- For the next iteration, `line` should be at position `k+4`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `line` to be the next line in the sequence `[2::2]`.

State: **The input file has at least three lines, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), the second line contains `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and the third line exists and is properly formatted. `elements` is a list of strings representing the substrings from `line` split by whitespace. `line` is the line at position `k+4` in the input file.**
