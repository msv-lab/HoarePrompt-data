Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` representing the number of cards each player receives, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through `n` appears in the sequence at most 2 times. The function returns the result for each test case based on the given conditions.**
