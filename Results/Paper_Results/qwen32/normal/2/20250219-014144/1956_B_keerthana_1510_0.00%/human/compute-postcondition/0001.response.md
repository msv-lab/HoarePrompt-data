The given code snippet splits a line of input into a list of elements. Given the initial state, the first line contains an integer `n`, the second line contains `n` integers, and the third line exists and is properly formatted. The code processes the second line.

Output State: **The input file has at least three lines, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), the second line contains `n` integers where each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times, and the third line exists and is properly formatted. `elements` is a list of strings representing the integers from the second line of the input file.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `elements` now holds a list of strings, each representing one of the integers from the second line of the input file. All other conditions about the input file remain unchanged.
