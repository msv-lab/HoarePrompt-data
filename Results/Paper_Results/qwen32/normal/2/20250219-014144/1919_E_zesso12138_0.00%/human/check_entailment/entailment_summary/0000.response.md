### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its components to determine if they correctly solve the problem as described.

#### Problem Recap:
- We have a hidden array `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1`.
- We compute the prefix sums `p` of `a`, sort `p`, and are given this sorted array.
- We need to determine how many different initial arrays `a` could result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

#### Provided Code Explanation:

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - This function uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to form the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` of size `2*n + 1` to handle the range of possible prefix sums (`-n` to `n`).
   - It iterates through each position in the array `a` and updates the DP table based on the possibility of adding `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.
   - The final result is obtained from the DP table at the index corresponding to the last element of `p` adjusted by an offset `n`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function handles reading input and processing multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size `n` and the sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

#### Analysis:
- The core logic of counting the number of possible arrays `a` is implemented in `func_1`.
- The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` correctly models the problem by considering all possible transitions between prefix sums.
- The handling of multiple test cases in `func_2` ensures that the solution works for each test case independently.
- The results are computed modulo `998244353` as required.

Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the implementation appears to be correct and efficient within the given limits.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: True**
