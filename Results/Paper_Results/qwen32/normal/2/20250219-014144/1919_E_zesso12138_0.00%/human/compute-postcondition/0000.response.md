The provided code snippet only includes the line `input = sys.stdin.read`. This line does not affect the variables `n` or `p` directly. Instead, it reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`, which changes how input is read from standard input but does not alter the existing variables `n` and `p`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, and `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, where `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**
