You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array a, where |p_i| <= n for all i, and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `n` is the size of the last array `p` processed; `p` is the last array of integers derived from `data`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `1 + t + sum of sizes of all arrays p`; `t` is 0; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: The loop has printed all elements in `results`. `n` is the size of the last array `p` processed, `p` is the last array of integers derived from `data`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `1 + t + sum of sizes of all arrays p`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, and `p`, which is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`. The absolute value of each element in `p` is less than or equal to `n`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns the hidden array `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
