The only variable in the loop head is `_` (an underscore), which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use inside the loop. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`.

Given that the loop iterates `t` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 each time the loop completes an iteration. However, since the loop variable `_` does not affect the loop's continuation, we only need to adjust `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was a positive integer.
2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decremented by 1.
3. All other variables (`n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `results`, `result`) do not affect the loop's continuation and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is a positive integer minus 1; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**

To be precise about the decrement of `t`:

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is `t - 1`; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**
