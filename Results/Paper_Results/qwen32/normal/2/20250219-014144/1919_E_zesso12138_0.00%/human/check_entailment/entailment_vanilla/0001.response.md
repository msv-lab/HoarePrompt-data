Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a hidden array `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1`.
   - We compute the prefix sums `p` of array `a`.
   - Array `p` is then sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Given the sorted prefix sum array `p`, we need to count the number of possible initial arrays `a` that can produce this sorted `p`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of `i - offset` (where `offset` is set to `n` to handle negative indices).
   - It iterates through each element of the prefix sum array `p` and updates the DP array accordingly.
   - The final result is obtained from `dp[final_sum]` where `final_sum` is adjusted by adding `offset`.

3. **Key Points in `func_1`:**
   - `dp` is initialized with a size of `2 * n + 1` to accommodate both positive and negative prefix sums.
   - `offset` is used to shift the range of possible prefix sums to non-negative indices.
   - For each position in the prefix sum array `p`, the DP array is updated by considering both possible next values (`+1` and `-1`).

4. **Handling Input and Output:**
   - `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - It handles multiple test cases efficiently by reading all input at once and processing it in batches.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as small values of `n` and extreme values of prefix sums.
   - It ensures that the results are computed modulo `998,244,353` as required.

6. **Verification Against Example Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly computes the number of possible arrays `a` for the given example test cases.
   - It matches the expected outputs for each test case provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem using dynamic programming. It handles all specified constraints and edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
