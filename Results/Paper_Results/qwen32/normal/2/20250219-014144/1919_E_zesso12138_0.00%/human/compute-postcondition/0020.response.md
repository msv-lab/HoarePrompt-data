The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decremented by 1 (`t = t - 1`). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1 before the decrement.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2 * n`; `t` is 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**
