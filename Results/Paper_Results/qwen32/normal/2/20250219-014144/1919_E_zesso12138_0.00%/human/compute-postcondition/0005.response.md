The code snippet provided initializes an empty list called `results`. This action does not affect the values of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `t`). Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a`, where `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
