The only variable in the loop head is `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(2 * n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1. For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

So, `j` becomes 2.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a` such that `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, with `dp[j]` being greater than 0 if the condition `dp[j] > 0` is true, and all other elements of `dp` are initialized to 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `new_dp[0]` which is `(2 * dp[1]) % MOD` and `new_dp[2]` which is `dp[1] % MOD` if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`; `j` is 2**
