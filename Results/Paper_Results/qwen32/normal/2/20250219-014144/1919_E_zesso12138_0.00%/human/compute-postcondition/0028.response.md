In the given for loop:

```python
for res in results:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only object in the loop head is `res`, which iterates over the elements in the `results` list. To ensure that the loop executes, the `results` list must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the size of the last array `p` processed.
- `p` is the last array of integers derived from `data`.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is `1 + t + sum of sizes of all arrays p`.
- `t` is 0.
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.
- `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.

Since `t` is 0, `results` currently contains 0 elements. For the loop to execute, `results` must have at least one element.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `results` contains at least one element.

State: **`n` is the size of the last array `p` processed, `p` is the last array of integers derived from `data`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `1 + t + sum of sizes of all arrays p`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least one element (e.g., `results` is `[some_value]`), `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration**
