The code appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The values of `n`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `t`, and `result` remain unchanged. Since `results` initially contains two elements, after appending `result`, `results` will contain three elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` where each element is converted to an integer; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `4 + 2 * n + n`; `t` is 1; `results` is a list containing three elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
