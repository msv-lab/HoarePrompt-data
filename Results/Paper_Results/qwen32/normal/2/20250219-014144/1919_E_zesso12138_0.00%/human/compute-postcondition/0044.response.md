Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a` such that `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, where at least one element `dp[j]` is greater than 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0 except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Additionally, `new_dp[j - 1]` is `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j - 1 >= 0`; specifically, if `dp[3] > 0`, then `new_dp[2]` is `(new_dp[2] + dp[3]) % MOD` and `new_dp[4]` is `(new_dp[4] + dp[3]) % MOD`; `j` is 3.**
