Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of array `a` such that `|p_i| <= n` for all `i`, and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers, where at least one element `dp[j]` is greater than 0; `offset` is `n`; `new_dp` is a list of `2 * n + 1` integers. If `dp[4] > 0`, then `new_dp[3]` is `(new_dp[3] + dp[4]) % MOD` and `new_dp[5]` is `(new_dp[5] + dp[4]) % MOD`. `j` is 4.**
