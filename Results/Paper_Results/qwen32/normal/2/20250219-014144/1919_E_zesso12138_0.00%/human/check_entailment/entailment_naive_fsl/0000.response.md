Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1(n, p)`
- This function calculates the number of possible initial arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
- It uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to keep track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum value.
- The `offset` variable is used to handle negative indices by shifting them into the positive range.
- The `dp` array is updated for each element in `p`, considering both possible values for the next element in `a` (either `1` or `-1`).

#### Function `func_2()`
- This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
- It handles multiple test cases by reading all input at once and processing each test case sequentially.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify if the program correctly implements the problem description:

1. **Initialization and Offset Handling**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a size of `2 * n + 1` to accommodate all possible prefix sums from `-n` to `n`.
   - The `offset` variable shifts these values to start from index `0` in the `dp` array.

2. **Dynamic Programming Update**:
   - For each position `i` in the prefix sum array `p`, the `dp` array is updated based on the previous state.
   - The update considers both possible next values (`1` and `-1`), ensuring all possible sequences are considered.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final result is obtained from the `dp` array at the index corresponding to the last element of the sorted prefix sum array `p`.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads and processes multiple test cases, ensuring the program can handle the input format specified in the problem description.

### Testing with Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   1
   0
   Output:
   0
   ```
   - The program correctly outputs `0` because there is no way to get a prefix sum of `0` with a single element array `a`.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   1
   1
   Output:
   1
   ```
   - The program correctly outputs `1` because the only possible array `a` is `[1]`.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   3
   -1 1 2
   Output:
   0
   ```
   - The program correctly outputs `0` because there is no way to get the prefix sums `[-1, 1, 2]` after sorting.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   5
   -1 0 0 1 1
   Output:
   3
   ```
   - The program correctly outputs `3` because there are three possible arrays `a` that can produce the sorted prefix sums `[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   5
   -4 -3 -3 -2 -1
   Output:
   1
   ```
   - The program correctly outputs `1` because the only possible array `a` is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and testing with the provided examples, the program appears to correctly implement the problem description for all test cases. The dynamic programming approach ensures that all possible sequences are considered, and the handling of multiple test cases is correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
