The only variable in the loop head is `res`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If `results` has more elements, the loop will execute again for each additional element.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least one element, and `res` held the value of the last element processed. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the `results` list.

Let's assume that `results` originally had two elements, and the last iteration processed the second element. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least three elements, and `res` should hold the value of the third element.

State: **`n` is the size of the last array `p` processed, `p` is the last array of integers derived from `data`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `1 + t + sum of sizes of all arrays p`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least three elements (e.g., `results` is `[some_value1, some_value2, some_value3]`), `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration, `res` is the third element of `results`**
