Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `p` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is a positive integer; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. All other variables retain their initial values.
