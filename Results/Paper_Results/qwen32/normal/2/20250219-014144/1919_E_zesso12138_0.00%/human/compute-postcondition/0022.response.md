Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `4 + 2 * n`; `t` is 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, p)`; `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation: The only variable that changes is `index`, which is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
