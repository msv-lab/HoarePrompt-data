To verify the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze the implementation and the annotations provided. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine how many different arrays `a` of size `n` (consisting of only `1` and `-1`) can produce a given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
   - A DP array `dp` is initialized with size `2 * n + 1` to handle both positive and negative prefix sums. The `offset` is set to `n` to map negative indices to non-negative ones.
   - The DP array `dp` keeps track of the number of ways to achieve a specific prefix sum. Initially, `dp[offset]` is set to `1` because there is one way to have a prefix sum of `0` (starting point).

3. **Updating the DP Array:**
   - For each element in the prefix sum array `p`, the DP array is updated by considering the possible previous prefix sums that could lead to the current prefix sum. Specifically, if the current prefix sum is `j`, the previous prefix sums could be `j - 1` or `j + 1` (since each element in `a` is either `1` or `-1`).
   - The DP array is updated iteratively for each element in `p`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - After processing all elements in `p`, the final result is obtained from `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the last element of `p` plus the `offset`.

5. **Handling Input and Output:**
   - `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - It handles multiple test cases efficiently by reading all input at once and processing it in batches.

### Verification Against Example Test Cases

Let's verify the program against the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `n = 1`, `p = [0]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No array `a` of size `1` can produce a sorted prefix sum array `[0]`.
   - The program correctly outputs `0`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `n = 1`, `p = [1]`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Only the array `a = [1]` can produce a sorted prefix sum array `[1]`.
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `n = 3`, `p = [-1, 1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No array `a` of size `3` can produce a sorted prefix sum array `[-1, 1, 2]`.
   - The program correctly outputs `0`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Three possible arrays `a` can produce the sorted prefix sum array `[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`:
     - `a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1]`
     - `a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1]`
     - `a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1]`
   - The program correctly outputs `3`.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Only the array `a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]` can produce the sorted prefix sum array `[-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`.
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.

### Annotations Validation

The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code accurately describe the state of the program at key points. They correctly reflect the initialization of the DP array, the iterative updates, and the final calculation of the result.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and verification against the example test cases, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem using dynamic programming. It handles all specified constraints and edge cases appropriately.
