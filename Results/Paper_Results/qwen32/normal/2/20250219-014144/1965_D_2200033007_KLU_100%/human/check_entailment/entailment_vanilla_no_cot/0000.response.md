To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze each function and see if they collectively solve the problem as described.

### Function Analysis:

1. **func_1(a):**
   - This function generates all possible subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them sorted.
   - It correctly computes all subarray sums and sorts them, which is useful for comparing with the given sums.

2. **func_2(cts):**
   - This function takes a list of subarray sums (`cts`) and removes duplicates by using a stack-like approach.
   - It pops an element if it matches the last element in the `odds` list; otherwise, it appends the element.
   - This effectively removes pairs of identical sums, which are expected due to the symmetry of the palindrome.

3. **func_3(odds, n):**
   - This function reconstructs the original palindrome array `a` from the list of unique subarray sums (`odds`).
   - It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It iterates through the `odds` list, filling in the values of `a` by computing the difference between consecutive sums and dividing by 2 (since the array is a palindrome).
   - It handles the middle element separately if `n` is odd.

4. **func_4(bigList, smallList):**
   - This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing two lists: `bigList` (which contains all subarray sums) and `smallList` (which contains all but one subarray sum).
   - It removes common elements from the end of both lists and returns the last element of `bigList`, which is the missing sum.

### Overall Solution Strategy:

- The program first generates all subarray sums of a hypothetical palindrome array (though it doesn't need to generate them for the input data).
- It then processes the given sums to remove duplicates, which should leave us with the sums corresponding to unique subarrays.
- Using these unique sums, it reconstructs the palindrome array.
- Finally, it identifies the missing subarray sum by comparing the generated sums with the given sums.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the solution against the first example:

- Input: `3`, `1 2 3 4 1`
- Expected Output: `1 2 1`

1. **func_1([1, 2, 1])** would generate `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`.
2. **func_2([1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4])** would process this to `[2, 4]` after removing duplicates.
3. **func_3([2, 4], 3)** would reconstruct the array `[1, 2, 1]`.

This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
