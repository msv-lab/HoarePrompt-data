To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
```

This means the loop will continue to execute as long as:
1. `smallList` is not empty (`len(smallList) > 0`).
2. The last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList` (`bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `bigList` is `[1, 2]`
- `smallList` is `[]`

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be satisfied:
1. `smallList` must not be empty.
2. The last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList`.

Since `smallList` is currently empty, we need to adjust it to contain at least one element. Additionally, we need to ensure that this element matches the last element of `bigList`, which is `2`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `smallList` to be `[2]` (or any list ending with `2`).

State: **`bigList` is `[1, 2]` and `smallList` is `[2]`**
