Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a`; `n` is an integer representing the length of the palindrome array `a` such that 3 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` zeros; `prev` is 0; `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2`.
Code of the loop:
for x in odds:
    if idx == n - 1 - idx:
        a[idx] = x
    else:
        a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
    prev = x
    idx = idx - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a` and must contain at least one element; `n` is an integer representing the length of the palindrome array `a` such that 3 <= n <= 1000; `a` is a list of `n` elements where if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, `a[idx]` is `x` and all other elements are 0; otherwise, `a[idx]` is `x // 2`, the element at index `(n + 1) // 2` is `(x - prev) // 2`, and all other elements are 0; `prev` is `x`; `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a` and must contain at least one element; `n` is an integer representing the length of the palindrome array `a` such that 3 <= n <= 1000; `prev` is the next element in the list `odds`; `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 2`; `x` is the next element in the list `odds`. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is now `x` and the rest of the conditions regarding the elements of `a` remain as described. Otherwise, `a[(n + 1) // 2]` is `(x - prev) // 2`, `a[idx]` is `x // 2`, and `a[n - 1 - idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`, with all other elements of `a` being 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of certain subarrays of the palindrome array `a` and must contain at least one element; `n` is an integer representing the length of the palindrome array `a` such that 3 <= n <= 1000; `idx` is `(n - 1) // 2 - 3`; `x` is the next element in the list `odds`; `prev` is `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
