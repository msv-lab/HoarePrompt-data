To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j`, `i`, and `len(a)`. 

Here's the given information:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `sm` is `a[j]`.
- `cts` contains all cumulative sums from `a[i]` to `a[len(a) - 1]` plus the value `a[j]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `len(a)` is greater than 1.

The loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(i, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this loop, `j` is incremented by 1 after each iteration. Since `i` remains constant throughout the loop, it does not need to be adjusted. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `len(a)`.

Given that `j` was used in the previous iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1 for the next iteration. The values of `sm` and `cts` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the loop head variables alone.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- `i` remains 1.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `len(a)` remains unchanged and is still greater than 1.

State: **`sm` is `a[j]`, `cts` contains all cumulative sums from `a[i]` to `a[len(a) - 1]` plus the value `a[j]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `len(a)` is greater than 1**.

However, since `sm` and `cts` are not part of the loop head and their exact values depend on the loop body, we should only adjust the loop head variables:

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `len(a)` is greater than 1**.
