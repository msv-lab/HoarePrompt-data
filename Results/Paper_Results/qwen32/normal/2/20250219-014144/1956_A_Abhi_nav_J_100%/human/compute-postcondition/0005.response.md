Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two lists as input: `a`, a list of `k` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, and `b`, a list of `q` integers. It compares the lists `a` and `b`. If `a` is lexicographically less than or equal to `b`, it returns a new list where each element of `a` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, it returns the list `b`.**
