The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `digits`. If `i` is less than the length of `digits`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2, and this value should still be less than the length of `digits`.

Since the problem statement does not provide information about the length of `digits`, we can only assume that `digits` has at least 2 elements (since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`digits` contains at least one digit, `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 2**.
