The code sorts the `letters` list in ascending order. Since `letters` already contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password`, sorting it will not change its content because it is already in ascending order (assuming the initial state meant `letters` was already sorted or unordered but only contained lowercase Latin letters).

Therefore, the `letters` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`digits` contains all the digits from the `password` sorted in ascending order, and `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` sorted in ascending order.**
