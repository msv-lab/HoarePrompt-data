The code appends the value of `char` (which is `next_char`) to the list `letters`. This means that the length of `letters` increases by one, and the last element of `letters` is now `next_char`. The values of `password` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`, `char` is `next_char`, `letters` has an additional element `next_char` appended to it.**
