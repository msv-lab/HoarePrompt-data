### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Separation and Sorting**:
   - The program separates the digits and letters into two lists and sorts them individually. This part is correct as it ensures that digits and letters are sorted within their respective groups.

2. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - The program checks if the digits list is sorted in non-decreasing order, but this check is redundant because the list is already sorted by the `sort()` method.
   - The program checks if the last digit is less than or equal to the first letter, which is not sufficient to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. For example, in the password "a1b2", the program would incorrectly consider it valid because '1' < 'b'. However, the correct requirement is that no digit should come after any letter, meaning the entire sequence of digits must precede the entire sequence of letters.

3. **Concatenation and Comparison**:
   - The program concatenates the sorted digits and letters and compares this with the original password. This approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the digits and letters are in their respective sorted positions within the original password. The correct approach would involve iterating through the password once and checking the conditions directly.

### Correct Approach:
- Iterate through the password once to ensure that:
  1. All digits come before any letters.
  2. Digits are in non-decreasing order.
  3. Letters are in non-decreasing order.

### Revised Code Example:
Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1` that adheres to the problem requirements:

```python
def func_1(password):
    seen_letter = False
    prev_digit = None
    prev_letter = None
    
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            if seen_letter:
                return False  # A digit comes after a letter
            if prev_digit is not None and char < prev_digit:
                return False  # Digits are not in non-decreasing order
            prev_digit = char
        else:
            seen_letter = True
            if prev_letter is not None and char < prev_letter:
                return False  # Letters are not in non-decreasing order
            prev_letter = char
    
    return True
```

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified and the need for a more robust solution, the original program does not meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
