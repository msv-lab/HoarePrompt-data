To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `i`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(len(digits)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `digits` contains at least one digit.
- `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` sorted in ascending order.
- `i` is 0.
- Either `i` is not less than `len(digits) - 1` or `digits[i]` is not greater than `digits[i + 1]`.
- Additionally, either `i` is not less than `len(letters)` or `digits[-1]` is not greater than `letters[i]`.

Since the loop iterates over `range(len(digits))`, the value of `i` at the start of each iteration should be the next integer in the sequence.

Let's analyze the conditions:
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(digits)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be 1 (since it was 0 at the end of the previous iteration).

No other variables in the loop head (`digits`) need to be adjusted because they are not modified within the loop head itself.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`digits` contains at least one digit, `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 1**.
