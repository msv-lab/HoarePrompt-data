Postcondition: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing at least two elements, both of which are the digit `char`, and `letters` is an empty list. Otherwise, `digits` is an empty list and `letters` is a list containing one element `char`, where `char` is not a digit.**
