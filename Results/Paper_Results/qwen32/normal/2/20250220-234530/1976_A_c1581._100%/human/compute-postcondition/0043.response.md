Functionality: **The function `func_1` checks if the given password string, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, is already sorted such that all digits come before any letters, both groups are individually sorted in ascending order, and the last digit is not greater than any letter. It returns `True` if these conditions are met; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
