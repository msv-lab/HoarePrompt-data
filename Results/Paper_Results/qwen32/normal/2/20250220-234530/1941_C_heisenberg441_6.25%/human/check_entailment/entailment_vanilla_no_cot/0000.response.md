Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not handle overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" properly. It also incorrectly handles the special case `if s == 'mapie': return 1`, which is unnecessary and incorrect. Here's why:

1. **Overlapping Substrings**: The current implementation removes non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie". However, if the removal of one substring creates another occurrence of "map" or "pie", this new occurrence will not be detected and removed. For example, in the string "mapiepie", the first removal of "map" results in "iepie", and then "pie" is removed, but the function should actually remove only 2 characters to make it beautiful.

2. **Incorrect Special Case Handling**: The condition `if s == 'mapie': return 1` is incorrect because it assumes that only the exact string "mapie" requires one removal, which is not true. Any string containing "map" or "pie" should be processed according to the logic of removing these substrings.

3. **Inefficient Removal Logic**: The current logic of finding and removing substrings repeatedly is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results due to the reasons mentioned above.

To fix these issues, a more robust approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that correctly handles overlapping substrings.
