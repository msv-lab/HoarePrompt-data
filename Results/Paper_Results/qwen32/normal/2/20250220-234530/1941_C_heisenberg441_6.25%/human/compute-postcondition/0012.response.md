Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\) (but now `n` is reduced by 2), `s` is a string of length `n-2` that no longer contains 'ap' from the first 'map', `ans` is 3**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
