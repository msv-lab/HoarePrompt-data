To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `s.find('pie') != -1`. This condition checks if the substring 'pie' exists within the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the new length of `s` after all 'map' substrings have been removed, decreased by 4
- `s` is a string that no longer contains the first occurrence of 'pie' and the character immediately following it
- `ans` is the total number of times 'map' was found and removed, increased by 1

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `s.find('pie') != -1` evaluates to `True`. This means that the string `s` must contain the substring 'pie'.

### Steps to Adjust the State:
1. **Ensure `s` contains 'pie':**
   - Since `s` no longer contains the first occurrence of 'pie' and the character immediately following it from the previous iteration, we need to add 'pie' back into `s` to satisfy the loop condition.

### Adjusted State:
- We need to modify `s` such that it includes the substring 'pie'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `ans` do not directly affect the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the new length of `s` after all 'map' substrings have been removed, decreased by 4; `s` is a string that contains the substring 'pie'; `ans` is the total number of times 'map' was found and removed, increased by 1**.
