Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the new length of `s` after all 'map' substrings have been removed, decreased by 4; `s` is a string that no longer contains 'pie' at the original position; `ans` is the total number of times 'map' was found and removed, increased by 3.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so if `ans` was previously increased by 2 due to the removal of 'map', it is now increased by 3. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
