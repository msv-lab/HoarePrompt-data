Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32; `ac` is 2 if the next character `i` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is 1; `bc` is 1 if the next character `i` is not 'A' and has been incremented by 1 in that case, otherwise `bc` remains 0; `s` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character; `i` is the next character in the string `s`.**
