Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

- Initial State:
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
  - `s` is the newly input string.
  - `s2` remains unchanged.

- Code Snippet:
  ```python
  print('No')
  ```

From the initial state, we see that the values of `t`, `s`, and `s2` are described but are not directly relevant to the print statement. The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`.

Output: **No**
