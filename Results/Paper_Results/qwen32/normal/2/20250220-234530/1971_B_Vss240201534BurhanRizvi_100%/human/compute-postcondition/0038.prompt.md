Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = input()
    if len(s) == 1:
        print('No')
    elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
        print('No')
    else:
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s == s2:
            s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
        print('Yes')
        print(s2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the input string. If the length of `s` is 1, `s` remains unchanged. If the length of `s` is greater than 1 and `s` consists of identical characters, `s` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is a shuffled version of `s`. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is the string `s` rotated by moving its first character to the end. Otherwise, `s2` remains a shuffled version of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `s` is the input string. If the length of `s` is 1, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `s` consists of the same character repeated more than once, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s2` is the string formed by moving the first character of `s` to the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the newly input string, and `s2` remains unchanged if the length of `s` is 1 or if `s` consists of identical characters and has a length greater than 1. Otherwise, `s2` is either `s` (if `s` equals `s2`) or `s[1:] + s[0]` (if `s` does not equal `s2`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
