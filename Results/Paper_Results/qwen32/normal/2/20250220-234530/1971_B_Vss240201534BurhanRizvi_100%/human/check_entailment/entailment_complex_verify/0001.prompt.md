You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: After executing all iterations, for each input string `s`, the program outputs "No" if `s` has a length of 1 or consists of identical characters (length > 1). Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" followed by a modified version of `s` (`s2`), which is either a shuffled version of `s` or `s` rotated by one position if the shuffle didn't change the order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of a string `s`. For each string, it checks if the string has a length of 1 or consists of identical characters. If so, it outputs "No". Otherwise, it outputs "Yes" followed by a modified version of the string, which is either a shuffled version of the string or the string rotated by one position if the shuffle did not change the order.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem statement:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If the length of `s` is 1, it immediately prints "NO" because there's no way to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
   - If the string `s` consists of all identical characters (checked using `len(set(s)) == 1`), it also prints "NO" because all permutations of such a string will be the same as the original.

3. **Generating a Different String:**
   - For other cases, it attempts to generate a new string `s2` by randomly shuffling the characters of `s` using `random.sample(s, len(s))`.
   - If the generated string `s2` happens to be the same as the original string `s`, it manually creates a new string by moving the first character to the end (`s[1:] + s[0]`).
   - It then prints "YES" followed by the newly generated string `s2`.

### Analysis:

- **Edge Cases Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the string cannot be rearranged to form a different string (single character or all identical characters).

- **Random Shuffling:**
  - The use of `random.sample` ensures that a permutation of the string is generated.
  - However, relying solely on random sampling might not always produce a different string in the first attempt, especially for smaller strings with repeated characters.
  - The fallback mechanism of moving the first character to the end ensures that a different string is always produced if possible.

- **Output Format:**
  - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" as required and provides a valid rearrangement when possible.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program seems to correctly handle all scenarios described in the problem statement. It ensures that a different string is produced when possible and correctly identifies when it's impossible to do so.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
