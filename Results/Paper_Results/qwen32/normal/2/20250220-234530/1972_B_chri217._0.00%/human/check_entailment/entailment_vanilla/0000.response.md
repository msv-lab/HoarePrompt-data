Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
- We have a circular arrangement of coins.
- Each coin can be either facing up ('U') or down ('D').
- Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its two adjacent coins.
- The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.

### Key Observations:
- The game revolves around the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of facing-up coins.
- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.
- If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.

### Explanation of the Solution:
- The solution reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins and their initial arrangement.
- It counts the number of facing-up coins (`num_up`).
- It checks the parity of `num_up`:
  - If `num_up` is odd, it prints "YES" (indicating Alice wins).
  - If `num_up` is even, it prints "NO" (indicating Bob wins).

### Code Review:
- The code correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- The function `func_1` accurately determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
- The logic aligns with the key observations made above.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
