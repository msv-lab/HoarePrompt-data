### Reasoning:

The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins ('U') at the start of the game. The key insight is that if the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will win if both players play optimally; if it's even, Bob will win.

Here's the breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a string `s` representing the state of each coin ('U' for up, 'D' for down).

2. **Counting 'U' Coins**: For each test case, the program counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.

3. **Determining the Winner**: The program checks if the count of 'U' coins is odd. If it is, Alice wins, and the program prints 'YES'. If the count is even, Bob wins, and the program prints 'NO'.

4. **Execution Summary**: The summary confirms that the function `func_1` correctly identifies whether the number of 'U' characters is odd or even and returns 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

Based on the problem statement and the provided solution, the logic implemented in the program aligns with the optimal strategy for determining the winner. The parity of the number of 'U' coins directly dictates the winner when both players play optimally.
