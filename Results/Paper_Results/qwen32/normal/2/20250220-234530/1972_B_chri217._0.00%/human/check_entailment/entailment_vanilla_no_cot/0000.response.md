To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly determines the winner of the game based on the provided problem description.

The key insight in the problem is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`). Here's the reasoning:

- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.
- If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.

This is because each move flips two coins, which changes the parity of the number of facing-up coins. Starting with an odd number of facing-up coins, Alice can ensure that she always leaves an even number for Bob, and vice versa.

Let's verify this with the provided example cases:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `UUDUD`
   - Number of `'U'`: 3 (odd)
   - Expected Output: `YES` (Alice wins)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `UDDUD`
   - Number of `'U'`: 2 (even)
   - Expected Output: `NO` (Bob wins)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `2`, `UU`
   - Number of `'U'`: 2 (even)
   - Expected Output: `NO` (Bob wins)

The provided program correctly implements this logic in the function `func_1`. It counts the number of `'U'` in the string `s` and returns `'YES'` if the count is odd and `'NO'` if the count is even.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
