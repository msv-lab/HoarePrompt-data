Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an integer greater than 0, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, `y` remains the same, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15)` if `x > 0`; otherwise, `bxsfory1` is 0. If `x == 0` or `y <= 0`, the values of `t`, `ap`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged except that `k` is incremented by 1.**
