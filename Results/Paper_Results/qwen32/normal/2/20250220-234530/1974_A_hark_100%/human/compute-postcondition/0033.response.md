Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `bxsfory` is calculated as the ceiling of `y / 2`, meaning it is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
