The code snippet calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`. This means `bxsfory` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Given the initial state, `t`, `ap`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `x` and `y` are also unchanged except for the new variable `bxsfory` being introduced.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`.**
