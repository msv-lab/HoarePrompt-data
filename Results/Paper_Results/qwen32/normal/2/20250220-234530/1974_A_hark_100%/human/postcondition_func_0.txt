The function reads an integer `ap` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`. It then calculates and prints a value based on the following rules: if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it computes a specific formula involving `x` and `y` and prints the result; if only `y` is greater than 0, it prints half of `y` rounded up; if only `x` is greater than 0, it prints `x` divided by 15 rounded up; if both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.
