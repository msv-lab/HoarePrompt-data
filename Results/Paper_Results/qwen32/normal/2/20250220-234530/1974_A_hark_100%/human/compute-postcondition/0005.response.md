Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is greater than 0, and `ap` is an integer greater than 0; `bxsfory` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `x` has been updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. All other variables (`t`, `y`, `ap`, and `bxsfory`) retain their original values and constraints.
