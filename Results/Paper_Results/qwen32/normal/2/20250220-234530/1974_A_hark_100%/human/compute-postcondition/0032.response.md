The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The values of `t`, `ap`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `ap` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input.**
