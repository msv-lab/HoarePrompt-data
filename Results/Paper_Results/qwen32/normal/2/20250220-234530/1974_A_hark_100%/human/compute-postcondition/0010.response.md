To determine the output of the `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is an integer greater than 0.
- `ap` is an integer greater than 0.

From this information, we know that `y` is a positive integer. The expression `y / 2` will result in a floating-point number that is half of `y`. The `math.ceil()` function rounds this floating-point number up to the nearest integer.

Let's break it down further:
- If `y` is even, `y / 2` will be an integer, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will return the same integer.
- If `y` is odd, `y / 2` will be a floating-point number with a fractional part of 0.5, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will round it up to the next whole number.

Therefore, the output will be the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Given that `y` is a positive integer, the precise value of the output depends on the specific value of `y`. However, we can describe the output in general terms.

Output: **the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2` (where `y` is a positive integer)**
