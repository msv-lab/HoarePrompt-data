To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is an integer greater than 0.
- `k` is incremented by 1 (though `k` is not used in the print statement).
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input (though `y` is not used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```

### Analysis:
- The `math.ceil()` function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the given number.
- The expression inside the `math.ceil()` function is `x / 15`.

### Steps:
1. **Determine the value of `x`**: Since `x` is the first integer from the input, its exact value is not specified in the initial state. We will denote it as `[x]`.
2. **Calculate `x / 15`**: This will result in a floating-point division.
3. **Apply `math.ceil()`**: This will round up the result of `x / 15` to the nearest integer.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`.

### Final Output:
Output: **math.ceil([x] / 15) (where [x] is the first integer from the input)**
