Let's analyze the given Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by calling `func_1()` which is defined below. This function reads the number of test cases (`ap`) and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons respectively.

2. **Logic for Placing Icons:**
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:**
     - It calculates `bxsfory` as the ceiling of `y / 2`. This represents the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons since each screen can fit at most 2 of these icons.
     - Then it adjusts `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and we need to account for the remaining space after placing these icons). However, this calculation seems incorrect because it subtracts 15 times the number of screens for 2x2 icons from `x`, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.
     - It then calculates `bxsfory1` as the ceiling of the adjusted `x` divided by 15, which is supposed to be the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. Again, this calculation is flawed because it assumes that the remaining space can be filled by 1x1 icons in multiples of 15 cells, which is not necessarily true.
     - Finally, it prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
   
   - **Case 2: Only `y` is greater than 0:**
     - It simply prints the ceiling of `y / 2`, which is correct as explained above.
   
   - **Case 3: Only `x` is greater than 0:**
     - It prints the ceiling of `x / 15`, which is incorrect because each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons, so the correct formula should be `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0:**
     - It correctly prints `0` as no screens are needed.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for handling both `x` and `y` being greater than 0 is flawed. Specifically, the way `x` is adjusted and the subsequent calculation of `bxsfory1` are incorrect.
- The calculation for the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons when `y` is 0 is incorrect. It should be `math.ceil(x / 15)` instead of `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of screens needed in all cases.

**Correctness:** **False**
