To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `ap` is an integer greater than 0.
- `k` is incremented by 1 (though `k` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(x / 15))
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet uses the `math.ceil()` function, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
- The argument to `math.ceil()` is `x / 15`, where `x` is one of the integers read from the input.

### Output Calculation:
- The output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`.
- Since `x` is an integer, `x / 15` may not be an integer, so `math.ceil(x / 15)` ensures that the result is rounded up to the nearest whole number.

### Final Output Description:
The code prints the smallest integer greater than or equal to the division of `x` by 15.

Output: **the smallest integer greater than or equal to x / 15 (where x is one of the integers read from the input)**
