The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. If `pl` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `pl` has at least 2 elements, and `j` is the second element of `pl`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `pl` must have at least 3 elements, and `j` should be the third element of `pl`.

State: **`w` is the length of `palka`, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`. If there exists an element `j` in `d` such that the count of `j` in `d` is greater than or equal to 3, then `shapes` is 2. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 1. `j` is the third element of `pl`.**
