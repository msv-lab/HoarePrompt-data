Postcondition: **`shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d` (updated if `i`'s count became 3 or more). `w` is incremented by 1. `ln` is an input integer. `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element. `i` is the next element in `palka`. If `d.get(i)` is `None`, `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented, and `shapes` is updated accordingly if `i`'s count becomes 3 or more.**
