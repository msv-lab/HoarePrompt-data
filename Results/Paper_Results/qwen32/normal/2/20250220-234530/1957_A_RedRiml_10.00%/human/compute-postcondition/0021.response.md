The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements in the list `palka`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next element in `palka`.

Given:
- `i` is currently `i_next`, where `i_next` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.
- `palka` is a list of integers with at least two elements.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- The current `i` has just finished its iteration, so `i` should be updated to the subsequent element in `palka`.

Let's denote the current `i` as `i_current`. The next element in `palka` after `i_current` is `i_next`. Since `i` is already set to `i_next` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be set to the element following `i_next`.

However, since the problem statement indicates that `i` is already `i_next` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to find the element after `i_next` for the next iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an integer read from the input; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least two elements; `pl` is a list that now contains the integer `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d` now contains the key `i` with the value 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i_next`, where `i_next` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.

For the next iteration, `i` should be the element after `i_next` in `palka`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an integer read from the input; `palka` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least two elements; `pl` is a list that now contains the integer `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`; `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d` now contains the key `i` with the value 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is the element in `palka` after `i_next`**
