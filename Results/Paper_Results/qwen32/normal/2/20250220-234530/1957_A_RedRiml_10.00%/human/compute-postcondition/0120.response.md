To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and understand the variables involved:

- `palka`: This is the original list of integers.
- `w`: This is the length of `palka` minus 1. It represents the last index of the list `palka`.
- `pl`: This is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
- `d`: This is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`. Each key is an element from `palka`, and the corresponding value is how many times it appears in `palka`.
- `shapes`: This is the total number of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times.
- `ln`: This is the original input integer, but its role is not specified in the context of the `shapes` variable.

The `print(shapes)` statement will output the value of `shapes`, which is the count of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times.

Given the information, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `shapes` without knowing the specific contents of `palka`. However, we can describe what `shapes` represents based on the provided initial state.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the total number of unique elements in `palka` that appear at least 3 times)**
