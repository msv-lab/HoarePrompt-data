The code snippet reassigns the variable `palka` to a new list of integers obtained from the input. This means that the original values of `w`, `pl`, `d`, and `shapes` are no longer valid because they were derived from the previous `palka`. After the new `palka` is assigned, `w` should be recalculated as the length of the new `palka` minus 1. `pl` should be updated to be a list of unique elements from the new `palka`. `d` should be recalculated to reflect the counts of each element in the new `palka`. Finally, `shapes` should be recalculated as the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in the new `palka`.

Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers from the input, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`, and `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`; `ln` is an input integer.**
