You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        print(shapes)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers, and prints the number of unique integers in each list that appear at least three times.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `w`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and then the list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Frequencies:**
   - The program initializes an empty dictionary `d` to store the frequency of each stick length.
   - It also initializes an empty list `pl` to keep track of unique stick lengths.
   - For each stick length `i` in `palka`, it updates the frequency in `d` and adds the length to `pl` if it's not already present.

3. **Determining Maximum Number of Polygons:**
   - The program initializes a variable `shapes` to zero, which will count the number of regular polygons that can be formed.
   - It iterates through the list of unique stick lengths `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length `j`, it checks if there are at least 3 sticks of that length (`if d[j] >= 3`).
     - If true, it increments the `shapes` counter by 1.
   - This logic assumes that a regular polygon can be formed with any set of 3 or more sticks of the same length, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

### Issue in the Logic:
- The problem requires forming regular polygons, which means all sides must be equal and the number of sides must be at least 3. However, the program only checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length and counts each such occurrence as one polygon.
- This approach does not consider the actual number of sides required for a polygon, nor does it ensure that the sticks can form a valid polygon with more than 3 sides.

### Correct Approach:
- For each unique stick length, determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed using that stick length. This involves dividing the count of sticks of that length by the smallest possible number of sides for a polygon (which is 3) and taking the integer part of the division.
- Sum these values across all unique stick lengths to get the total number of polygons.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not account for the number of sides required to form a polygon beyond 3.
