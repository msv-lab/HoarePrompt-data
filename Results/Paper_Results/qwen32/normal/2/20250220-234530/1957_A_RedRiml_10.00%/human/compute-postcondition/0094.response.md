Postcondition: **`palka` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `w` is the length of `palka` minus 1, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the element `i`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either `1` (if `i` was not previously in `d`) or incremented by `1` (if `i` was already in `d`), `shapes` is the number of unique elements in the previous `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, `ln` is an input integer. If `i` was not in `pl` before the if statement, it is now added to `pl` and `d[i]` is updated accordingly.**
