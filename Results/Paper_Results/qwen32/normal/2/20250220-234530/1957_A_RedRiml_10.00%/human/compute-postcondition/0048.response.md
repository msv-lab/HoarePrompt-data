The code snippet `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. This means that the dictionary `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`.

Since `d` was initially an empty dictionary, after executing the code, `d` will have one entry: `{i: 1}`.

The other variables (`shapes`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`) are not affected by this line of code, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that have a count of 3 or more in `d`; `w` is incremented by 1; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is `{i: 1}`.**
