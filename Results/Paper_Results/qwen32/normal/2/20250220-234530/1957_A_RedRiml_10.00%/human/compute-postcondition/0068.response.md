The code sets the variable `shapes` to 0. This overrides the previous value of `shapes`, which was the number of unique elements in `pl` that appeared 3 or more times in `d`. The other variables (`w`, `pl`, `d`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is the length of `palka`, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each element in `palka`, and `shapes` is 0.**
