The code snippet `t %= MOD` modifies the value of `t` to be the remainder when `t` is divided by `MOD`. This operation does not affect the values of `tmp`, `ans`, or `k`.

Given that `t` was initially defined as twice the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0, after the operation `t %= MOD`, `t` will hold the value of `t % MOD`.

The value of `ans` is initially calculated as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. Since `t` changes, `ans` will also change to reflect this new value of `t`. However, the problem statement asks us to only describe the changes to the variables that have been directly modified by the code snippet, which is `t` in this case.

Therefore, the updated state is:
Output State: **`t` is `(twice the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0) % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `k` must be greater than 1.**
