Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `ans` is `((s + t * (2^k - 2)) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line, `s` is the sum of the list `a`.**

Natural Language: The variables `t` and `tmp` have been reset to 0. All other variables (`ans`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `s`) retain their original values.
