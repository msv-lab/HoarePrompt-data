Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer read from the input and `a` must have at least one element, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`. Since the condition `tmp < 0` is false, no changes are made to the variables.**
