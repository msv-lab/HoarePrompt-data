Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is the integer read from input representing the number of test cases; for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `MOD` is 1000000007.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
    s = sum(a)
    t, tmp = 0, 0
    for x in a:
        tmp += x
        if tmp < 0:
            tmp = 0
        t = max(tmp, t)
    ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD
    for i in range(k - 1):
        t *= 2
        t %= MOD
        ans += t
        ans %= MOD
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t_initial * 2^(k-1) % MOD`; `tmp` is 0 if the last contiguous subarray sum was negative; otherwise, it is the sum of the last contiguous subarray with a positive sum; `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than or equal to 1; `n` and `k` are integers such that `k` is at least 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer; `MOD` is 1000000007; `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`; `ans` is `((s + t_initial) % MOD + t_initial * (2^(k-1) - 1)) % MOD`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends, `ans` is `((s + t * (2^k - 2)) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`; `tmp` is the final cumulative sum (or 0 if negative); `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t * (2^(k-1) - 1)) % MOD`; `T` is `T - 1`; `n` is the first integer read from input; `k` is the second integer read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input line; `s` is the sum of the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
