The code snippet `ans += t` adds the value of `t` to the current value of `ans`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` is initially calculated as `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`, which simplifies to `ans % MOD`.

After executing `ans += t`, the new value of `ans` becomes `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t + t`, which simplifies to `((s + 2*t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + 2*t`. This further simplifies to `(ans + t) % MOD`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is `ans + t`.

Output State: **`t` is `(((twice the maximum cumulative sum encountered in the list `a` without going below 0) % MOD) * 2 % MOD) * 2 % MOD`; `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends; `ans` is `(ans + t) % MOD`; `k` must be greater than 1; `i` is `k - 1`.**
