The code reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into components based on spaces, and maps each component to an integer, storing the resulting list in the variable `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `tmp`, `ans`, `T`, `n`, or `k`.

Output State: **`t` is `(2^(k-1) * t) % MOD`, `tmp` is the cumulative sum of the last sequence of non-negative sums before the loop ends, `ans` is `((s + t * (2^k - 2)) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input line.**
