The given code snippet is `tmp += x`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming there was a typo and the intention was to use `tmp += tmp` or `tmp += t` or any other variable, let's consider the most straightforward case where `x` should logically be `tmp` (since `x` is not defined).

Given that `x` is assumed to be `tmp`, the code would be `tmp += tmp`, which effectively doubles the value of `tmp`.

Initial State: `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer read from the input and `a` must have at least one element, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`

After executing `tmp += tmp`:
- `tmp` is doubled, so `tmp` remains 0 because 0 doubled is 0.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is an integer read from the input and `a` must have at least one element, `MOD` is 1000000007, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`**.
