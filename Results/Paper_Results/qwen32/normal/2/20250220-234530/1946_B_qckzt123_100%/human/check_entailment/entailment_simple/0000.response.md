### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The key insight is to identify the maximum possible sum of any contiguous subarray (`t`) because repeatedly adding this maximum sum can lead to the highest overall sum.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array), `k` (number of operations), and the array `a`.

2. **Calculating Initial Sum (`s`):**
   - It calculates the sum of the array `a` and stores it in `s`.

3. **Finding Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`):**
   - It uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`. This is stored in `t`.

4. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`. This accounts for the initial sum of the array plus the maximum possible subarray sum.

5. **Performing Operations:**
   - For each remaining operation (from `k-1` down to `0`), the program doubles the current maximum subarray sum (`t`) and adds it to the answer. This doubling reflects the fact that we can keep adding the maximum subarray sum to maximize the total sum. The result is taken modulo `MOD` to prevent overflow.

6. **Output:**
   - After processing all operations, the program prints the final answer for each test case.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with some example test cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `2 2`, `-4 -7`
  - Initial sum `s = -11`
  - Maximum subarray sum `t = 0` (since all elements are negative, the best subarray sum is the empty subarray)
  - Final answer: `((-11 + 0) % MOD + MOD) % MOD = 999999996`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `3 3`, `2 2 8`
  - Initial sum `s = 12`
  - Maximum subarray sum `t = 12` (the entire array)
  - First operation: `ans = (12 + 12) % MOD = 24`
  - Second operation: `t = 24`, `ans = (24 + 24) % MOD = 48`
  - Third operation: `t = 48`, `ans = (48 + 48) % MOD = 96`

These examples align with the expected outputs, indicating that the program logic is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations by leveraging the maximum subarray sum and repeatedly adding it. Therefore, the program is correct.
