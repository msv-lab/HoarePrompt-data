Output State: **`t` is `(2 * t) % MOD`; `tmp` is the final cumulative sum (or 0 if negative); `ans` is `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD`; `T` is `T - 1`; `n` is the first integer read from input; `k` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input line; `s` is the sum of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is recalculated to be `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t) % MOD` due to the operation `ans %= MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
