### Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations where each operation allows the insertion of the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array. The key insight here is that the maximum possible sum can be achieved by repeatedly inserting the maximum subarray sum (obtained via Kadane's algorithm) into the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:** The program reads the number of test cases `T`. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Calculating Total Sum (`s`):** It calculates the total sum of the array `a`.

3. **Finding Maximum Subarray Sum (`t`):** Using Kadane's algorithm, it finds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `a`. This is done by iterating through the array and maintaining a running sum `tmp` which resets to 0 if it becomes negative. The maximum value of `tmp` during this process is stored in `t`.

4. **Initial Answer Calculation:** The initial answer is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`. This accounts for the original sum of the array plus the maximum subarray sum.

5. **Doubling the Maximum Subarray Sum:** For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, the program doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` and adds it to the answer. This is because the optimal strategy is to keep adding the maximum subarray sum to maximize the overall sum of the array. The modulo operation ensures that the result remains within the bounds of the problem constraints.

6. **Printing the Result:** Finally, the program prints the computed answer for each test case.

The program correctly implements the above logic and handles large numbers using modulo operations. It efficiently computes the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, adhering to the problem's requirements.
