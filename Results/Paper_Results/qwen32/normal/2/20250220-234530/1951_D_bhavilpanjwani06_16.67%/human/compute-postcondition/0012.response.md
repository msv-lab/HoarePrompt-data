To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k` (\(n \geq k\)).
- `n` is not equal to `k` (\(n \neq k\)).
- The current value of `k` satisfies the condition \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Expression `n - k + 1`:**
   - Given that \(n > k\), it follows that \(n - k\) is a positive integer.
   - Adding 1 to \(n - k\) ensures that `n - k + 1` is also a positive integer.
   - The exact value of `n - k + 1` depends on the specific values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Constant `1`:**
   - The second argument in the `print` statement is the integer `1`.

### Condition Analysis:
- The condition \(k - 1 < n - k + 1\) simplifies to \(2k - 2 < n\) or \(2k < n + 2\), which further simplifies to \(k < \frac{n + 2}{2}\).
- This condition confirms that `k` is less than the midpoint of `n` plus one, ensuring that `n - k + 1` is indeed a positive integer greater than 1.

### Conclusion:
- The `print` statement will output two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
- The value of `n - k + 1` is determined by the specific values of `n` and `k`, but it is guaranteed to be a positive integer greater than 1 based on the given conditions.

### Final Output:
Output: **n - k + 1, 1 (where n - k + 1 is a positive integer greater than 1 based on the given conditions)**
