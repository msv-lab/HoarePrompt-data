Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- It is specified that `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- Additionally, it is mentioned that the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(1)`. This statement directly prints the integer `1` to the console. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the execution of this particular `print` statement because it does not reference any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
