Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are described with specific constraints, but the `print` statement does not depend on these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
2. It also specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers, each between 1 and \(10^{18}\), inclusive, and that `n` is currently less than `k`.
3. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`, which means it will output the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`.

Output: **NO**
