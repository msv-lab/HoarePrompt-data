Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ \(10^{18}\).
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k` (`n ≥ k`).
- `n` is not equal to `k` (`n ≠ k`).
- The current value of `k` satisfies the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement directly outputs the integer `2`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` do not influence the output of this specific print statement because it does not reference these variables. It simply prints the constant value `2`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement is the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
