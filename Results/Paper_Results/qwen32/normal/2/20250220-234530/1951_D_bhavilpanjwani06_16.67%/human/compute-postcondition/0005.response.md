The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers, each between 1 and \(10^{18}\), inclusive, with `n` being greater than or equal to `k`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
