### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by handling three distinct scenarios:

1. **When `n < k`:**
   - In this scenario, Alice does not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels, so the output should be "NO".
   - The code correctly handles this by printing "NO".

2. **When `n == k`:**
   - Here, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if she buys one jewel for `n` coins.
   - The code correctly handles this by printing "YES", followed by `1` (indicating one stall), and then `n` (the price of one jewel).

3. **When `n > k`:**
   - The code checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. If true, it sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.
     - If Alice buys one jewel at the first stall, she will have `n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1` coins left.
     - With `k - 1` coins, she can buy `k - 1` more jewels at the second stall, totaling `k` jewels.
   - However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in all cases. Specifically, if `k` is large, the difference `n - k + 1` might be too high, preventing Alice from buying any jewels at the first stall, or it might not allow her to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Moreover, the code does not handle cases where more than two stalls are needed, which is necessary when `k` cannot be achieved with just two stalls.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not cover all possible scenarios and does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in all cases. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness:** **False**
