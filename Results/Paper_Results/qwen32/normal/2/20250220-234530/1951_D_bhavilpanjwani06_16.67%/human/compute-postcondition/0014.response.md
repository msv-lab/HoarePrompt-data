Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are described with certain constraints, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable Descriptions:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and \(10^{18}\), inclusive.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.
   - `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`, which simplifies to `k - 1 >= n - k + 1` or `2k - 2 >= n` or `2k >= n + 2` or `k >= (n + 2) / 2`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.
   - This statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
