Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- We know that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers, both between 1 and \(10^{18}\), inclusive.
- It is specified that `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- Importantly, it is stated that the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

Given this information, we need to determine what the `print(n)` statement will output.

Since `n` is explicitly stated to be equal to `k`, and no further operations or changes to `n` are described in the given context, `n` retains the value of `k`.

Therefore, when the `print(n)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `n`, which is the same as the value of `k`.

Output: **n (where n is equal to k)**
