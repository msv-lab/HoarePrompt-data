Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs a list of numbers based on powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\), modifies this list by adding and removing specific elements related to `k`, and then outputs the length of the modified list followed by its elements. The results for each test case are independent of one another.**
