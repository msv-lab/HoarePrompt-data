### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Initialization of `nums`:**
   ```python
   nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
   ```
   This initializes `nums` with the first 21 powers of 2 (i.e., 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^20). These values are chosen because they form a basis for creating subsequences that can sum to many different values.

2. **Finding the appropriate index:**
   ```python
   idx = -1
   for i in range(len(nums)):
       if nums[i] > k:
           idx = i - 1
           break
   ```
   This loop finds the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`. The variable `idx` will hold the index of this value in the `nums` list.

3. **Modifying `nums`:**
   ```python
   nums.append(k - nums[idx])
   nums.append(k + 1)
   nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
   nums.remove(1 << idx)
   ```
   Here, the program modifies the `nums` list by:
   - Adding `k - nums[idx]` to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - Adding `k + 1` to cover sums greater than `k`.
   - Adding `k + nums[idx] + 1` to further ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - Removing `1 << idx` (which is the same as `nums[idx]`) to adjust the set of possible sums.

4. **Output:**
   ```python
   print(len(nums))
   print(*nums)
   ```
   Finally, the program prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the list itself.

### Analysis:

- **Subsequences Summing to Values Other Than `k`:**
  The initial set of powers of 2 allows for the creation of subsequences that can sum to many different values. By modifying the list as described, the program ensures that all sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be achieved through some combination of the elements in `nums`.

- **Avoiding Subsequences Summing to `k`:**
  The specific modifications made to `nums` (adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, and removing `nums[idx]`) are designed to prevent any subsequence from summing to `k`. This is because the removed element and the added elements are carefully chosen to disrupt any combination that would sum to `k`.

- **Size Constraint:**
  The final size of `nums` is at most 25, which satisfies the problem's requirement that the sequence has a size of at most 25.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
