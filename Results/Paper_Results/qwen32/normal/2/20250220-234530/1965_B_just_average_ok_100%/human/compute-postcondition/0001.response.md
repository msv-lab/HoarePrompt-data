The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state only specifies the range of `t`, which is not affected by the given code. Therefore, after executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values read from the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input.**
