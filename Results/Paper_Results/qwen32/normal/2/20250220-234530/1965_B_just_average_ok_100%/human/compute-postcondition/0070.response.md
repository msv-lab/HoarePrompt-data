To determine the output of the `print(len(nums))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `nums` list.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. This value does not directly affect the construction of `nums`.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `nums` is constructed as follows:
  - Start with the list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
  - Append `k + 1` to this list.
  - Append `k + nums[idx] + 1` to this list, where `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k` or -1 if no such index exists.
  - Remove the element `2^idx` from the list.

### Determining `idx`:

- `idx` is the largest index `i` such that `nums[i] <= k`.
- If no such index exists (i.e., all elements in `nums` are greater than `k`), then `idx = -1`.

### Constructing `nums`:

1. Start with the base list: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
2. Determine `idx`:
   - If `k < 1`, `idx = -1`.
   - Otherwise, find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
3. Append `k + 1` to the list.
4. Append `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list.
5. Remove the element `2^idx` from the list.

### Length Calculation:

- The base list has 21 elements.
- Two additional elements are appended (`k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`).
- One element is removed (`2^idx`).

Thus, the length of `nums` will be `21 + 2 - 1 = 22`.

### Final Output:

Output: **22**
