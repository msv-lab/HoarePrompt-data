Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `nums` is a predefined list with specific values: 
  \[
  [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, k - 1048576, k + 1, 2*k - 1048575]
  \]
- `idx` is set to 20.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(nums))
```

### Analysis:
The `print(len(nums))` statement will output the length of the list `nums`.

From the definition of `nums`, we know it contains 23 elements:
- The first 20 elements are explicitly listed as powers of 2 up to \(2^{19}\).
- The next three elements are calculated based on `k`: \(k - 1048576\), \(k + 1\), and \(2*k - 1048575\).

Therefore, regardless of the value of `k`, the list `nums` will always have 23 elements.

### Conclusion:
The `print(len(nums))` statement will print the number 23.

### Final Output:
Output: **23**
