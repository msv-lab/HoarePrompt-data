In this case, the loop head only contains the variable `_` which is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times based on the input. The loop iterates `int(input())` times, meaning it depends on the value of `n` (the first integer from the input).

Given that the loop head does not contain any other variables that are modified within the loop, the only state that needs adjustment is the loop counter itself. However, since `_` is not explicitly used or modified in the loop, we focus on the iteration count.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have completed one iteration, so the remaining iterations would be `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that there is one less iteration left to complete.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`] excluding `1 << idx`, and `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` (excluding the newly added elements) that is less than or equal to `k`, or `-1` if `k` is greater than 1048576.**
