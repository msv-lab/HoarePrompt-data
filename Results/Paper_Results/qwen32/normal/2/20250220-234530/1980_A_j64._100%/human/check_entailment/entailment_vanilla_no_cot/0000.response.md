Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement that each round must contain one problem of each difficulty level ('A' through 'G'). The current implementation calculates the total number of additional problems needed across all difficulty levels, but it does not ensure that each round will have exactly one problem of each required difficulty level.

To fix this, we need to ensure that for each round, there is at least one problem of each difficulty level. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        # For each difficulty level, we need `m` problems, so we check if we have less than `m`
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
    return needed_problems
```

However, the logic in the function is actually correct for the problem statement provided. The function correctly calculates the minimum number of problems needed to ensure that each of the `m` rounds has at least one problem of each difficulty level 'A' through 'G'. Therefore, the initial implementation is indeed correct.

Thus, the original response should be:

Correctness: **True**
