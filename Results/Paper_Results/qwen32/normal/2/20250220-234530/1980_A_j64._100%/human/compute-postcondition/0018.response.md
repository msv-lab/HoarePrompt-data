Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers, `i` is 2. If `count[2] < m`, then `needed_problems` is set to `m - count[2]`. Otherwise, `needed_problems` remains 0.**
