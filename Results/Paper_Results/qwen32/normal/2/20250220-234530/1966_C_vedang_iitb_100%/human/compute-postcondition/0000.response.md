Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is now assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
