To determine the necessary adjustments for the given loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head contains the variable `tc` and the range `t`.

Given the loop:
```python
for tc in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- **Variable `tc`:** This variable is the loop variable that takes values from 0 up to `t-1`.
- **Range `t`:** This specifies how many times the loop will iterate, which is determined by the value of `t`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute because the range will be empty.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The state of `t` must be such that the loop can execute. Since `t` is already defined as an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself.
- The loop variable `tc` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is automatically initialized by the `range` function.

### Conclusion:
Since `t` is already within the valid range (1 to \(10^4\)), no changes are required to ensure the loop executes. The initial state of `t` is sufficient for the loop to run.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tc` is initialized by the range function starting from 0**.

However, since the problem asks us to specify only the necessary adjustments and `t` is already correctly specified, we can simply state:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.
