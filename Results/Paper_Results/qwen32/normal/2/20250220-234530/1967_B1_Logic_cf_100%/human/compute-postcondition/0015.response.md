The code snippet converts the strings `n` and `m` into integers. This affects the types of `n` and `m` but does not change their values in terms of the numbers they represent.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer representing the first number from the input, `m` is an integer representing the second number from the input, `ans` is equal to `n + Î£((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`, `T` is `T + 1`.**

In natural language: The variables `n` and `m` are now integers instead of strings, while the other variables remain unchanged.
