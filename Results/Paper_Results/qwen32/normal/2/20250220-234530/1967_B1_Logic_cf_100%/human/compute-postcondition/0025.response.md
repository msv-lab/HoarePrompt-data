The only variable in the loop head is `T`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T` and `t`. If `T` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is incremented by 1.

Given that `T` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `T` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, if `T` was `T` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `T` will be `T + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` is the first number from the input, `m` is the second number from the input, `ans` is `n + Î£((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`, `T` is `T + 1`**
