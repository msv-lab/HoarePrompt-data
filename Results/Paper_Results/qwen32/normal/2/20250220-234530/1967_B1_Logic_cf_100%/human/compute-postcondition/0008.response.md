Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `b` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and the incremented `b` remain as per their initial conditions.
