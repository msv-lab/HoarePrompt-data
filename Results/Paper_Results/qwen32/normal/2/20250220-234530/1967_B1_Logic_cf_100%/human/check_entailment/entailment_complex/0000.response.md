### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem statement and the provided code to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Statement:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \( 1 \leq a \leq n \)
2. \( 1 \leq b \leq m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of \( b \) and calculating the contribution to the answer based on the formula:
\[ \text{ans} = n + \sum_{b=2}^{\min(n, m)} \left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor \]

However, there are some issues with this approach:

1. **Initialization of `ans`:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This suggests that the code assumes that for every \( b = 1 \), there are exactly \( n \) valid pairs (since \( \gcd(a, 1) = 1 \) and \( a + 1 \) is always a multiple of 1). This part seems correct.

2. **Loop for `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`:**
   - The loop iterates over possible values of \( b \) starting from 2 up to \( \min(n, m) \).
   - For each \( b \), it calculates the contribution to the answer using the formula \( \left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor \).

3. **Formula Validation:**
   - The formula \( \left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor \) is intended to count the number of valid \( a \) values for a fixed \( b \).
   - However, the formula does not directly account for the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). It seems to be an approximation or a derived formula that might not hold true for all cases.

#### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the code against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:** \( n = 1, m = 1 \)
  - Expected Output: 1
  - Calculation: \( \text{ans} = 1 + \sum_{b=2}^{1} \left\lfloor \frac{1 + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor = 1 \)
  - Output: 1 (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:** \( n = 2, m = 3 \)
  - Expected Output: 3
  - Calculation: \( \text{ans} = 2 + \sum_{b=2}^{2} \left\lfloor \frac{2 + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor = 2 + \left\lfloor \frac{4}{4} \right\rfloor = 3 \)
  - Output: 3 (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:** \( n = 3, m = 5 \)
  - Expected Output: 4
  - Calculation: \( \text{ans} = 3 + \sum_{b=2}^{3} \left\lfloor \frac{3 + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor = 3 + \left\lfloor \frac{5}{4} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{6}{9} \right\rfloor = 3 + 1 + 0 = 4 \)
  - Output: 4 (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:** \( n = 10, m = 8 \)
  - Expected Output: 14
  - Calculation: \( \text{ans} = 10 + \sum_{b=2}^{8} \left\lfloor \frac{10 + b}{b \cdot b} \right\rfloor = 10 + \left\lfloor \frac{12}{4} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{13}{9} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{14}{16} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{15}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{16}{36} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{17}{49} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{18}{64} \right\rfloor = 10 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 14 \)
  - Output: 14 (Correct)

From the above examples, the code seems to produce the correct output. However, the correctness of the formula used in the loop is not immediately obvious without a rigorous mathematical proof.

### Conclusion:
Given the examples provided and the behavior of the code, it appears to be correct. However, the correctness of the formula used in the loop is not thoroughly proven here. Nonetheless, based on the given examples, we can conclude:

**Correctness: True**
