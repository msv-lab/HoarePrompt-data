To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the first number from the input.
- `m` is the second number from the input.
- `ans` is calculated as `n + Σ((n + b) // (b * b))` for `b` ranging from 2 to `min(n, m)`.
- `T` is incremented by 1 (`T = T + 1`), but it is not used in the `print` statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variable `n`**: This is the first number from the input.
2. **Variable `m`**: This is the second number from the input.
3. **Variable `ans`**: This is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{ans} = n + \sum_{b=2}^{\min(n, m)} \left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \times b} \right\rfloor
   \]
   Here, \(\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor\) denotes the floor function, which rounds down to the nearest integer.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- Start with `ans = n`.
- For each integer `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, compute \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b \times b} \right\rfloor\) and add this value to `ans`.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the computed value of `ans` based on the above formula.

Given the initial state and the calculation method, the output will be:

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as n + Σ((n + b) // (b * b)) for b ranging from 2 to min(n, m))**
