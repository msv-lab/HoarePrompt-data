Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 2, `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b) + (n + (b + 1)) // ((b + 1) * (b + 1)) + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `T` is `T + 1`, `b` is `b + 1` where `b + 1 <= min(n, m)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged except for `ans`, which now includes the additional term.
