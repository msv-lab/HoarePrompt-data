Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The current implementation sorts the array and then finds the count of the median element, which does not help in determining the number of operations needed to increase the median.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to focus on increasing the median element(s) to make the median larger than its current value. Here's a corrected approach:

1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the median element(s).
3. Determine how many increments are needed to make the median larger than its current value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    import heapq
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Find the median index
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        
        # The current median
        current_median = a[p]
        
        # We need to find the smallest number greater than the current median
        # and count how many increments are needed to make the median that number.
        
        # Use a min-heap to efficiently find the smallest number greater than the current median
        min_heap = []
        for num in a:
            if num > current_median:
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, num)
        
        # If there are no elements greater than the current median, we need to increment the current median itself
        if not min_heap:
            next_median = current_median + 1
        else:
            next_median = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        
        # Calculate the number of operations needed to make the median equal to next_median
        operations = 0
        for i in range(p + 1):
            if a[i] < next_median:
                operations += next_median - a[i]
        
        print(operations)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
