The given code snippet reassigns the value of `p` based on the length of the list `a`. Since `p` is already defined as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` in the initial state, the code does not change its value because it is being reassigned the same expression.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 10^4, `n` is the length of the newly input list `a`, `a` is the newly input list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` using the new `n`, `res` is the count of `a[p]` in the sorted list `a`.**
