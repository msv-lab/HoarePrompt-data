The provided code snippet is just a comment and does not contain any executable Python code. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) will be modified. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
