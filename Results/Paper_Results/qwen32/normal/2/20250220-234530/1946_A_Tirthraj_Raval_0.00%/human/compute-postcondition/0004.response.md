The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. This means the original list `a` is overwritten with the new list of integers from the input.

Given the initial state, `t` and `n` retain their values, but `a` is updated to the new list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `t` must be at least 1.**
