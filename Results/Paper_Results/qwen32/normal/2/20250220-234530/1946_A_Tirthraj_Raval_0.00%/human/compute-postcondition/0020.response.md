The given code snippet updates the value of `p` based on the newly input integer `n`. The variable `p` is recalculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.

Since the initial state specifies that `p` was previously calculated using the old `n` value, and now it is recalculated with the new `n` value, only `p` changes. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 10^4, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` is the newly input list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` using the new `n`, `res` is the count of `a[p]` in the sorted list `a` using the old `n`.**
