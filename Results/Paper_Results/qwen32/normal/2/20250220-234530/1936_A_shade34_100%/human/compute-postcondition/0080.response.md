The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Given that the current input is `'<'`, and `mak` is initially 0, after executing the code, `mak` will take the value of `i`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`; `mak` is `i`; the current input is `'<'`.**
