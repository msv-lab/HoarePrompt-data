The code snippet assigns the list `[i]` to the variable `pans`. Since `mak` is defined as `i`, and `mak2` is defined as the original `mak`, these variables remain unchanged. The string `s` and the integer `n` also remain unchanged. The only change is that `pans` now holds the list `[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is `i`, `mak2` is `i`, `pans` is `[i]`, `s` is `'<'`.**
