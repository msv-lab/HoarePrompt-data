The code assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. Since `mak` is defined as the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak2` will now hold the same value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`; `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.**
