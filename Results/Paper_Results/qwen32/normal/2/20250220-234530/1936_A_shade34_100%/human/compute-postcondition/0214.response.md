The code assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. This changes the value of `mak` from its previous state (`i` if the input is `'>'`; otherwise, `mak` was `i - 1`) to simply `i`. The values of `mak2`, `pans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list with at least `i + 1` elements, and `i` is `i`.**
