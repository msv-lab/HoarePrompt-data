The value of `mak` is updated to the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`, and possibly the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`; `mak` is `i`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
