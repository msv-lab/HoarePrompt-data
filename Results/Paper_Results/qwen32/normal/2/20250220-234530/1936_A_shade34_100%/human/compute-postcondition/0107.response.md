To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.
- `s` is the input string.
- Depending on the value of `s`, `pans` and `mak` are updated accordingly.

Since the loop head only involves `i` and `n`, we need to adjust these two variables for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`).
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

2. **Current State of `n`:**
   - `n` does not change during the loop iterations. It remains constant throughout the loop.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that needs adjustment is `i`. It should be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.

### Final State:
- `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration (`i_prev`) is not specified, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` where `i` is the value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `s` is the input string; `i` is incremented by 1**.
