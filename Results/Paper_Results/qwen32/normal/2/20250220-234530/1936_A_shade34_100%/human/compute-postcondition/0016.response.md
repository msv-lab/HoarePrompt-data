The given code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered data is written to the console. However, this command does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `mak`, or `i` are modified by this command. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i` if the input string was `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
