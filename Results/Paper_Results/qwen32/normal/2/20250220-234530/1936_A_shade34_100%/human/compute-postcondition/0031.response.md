The code snippet provided is `pans.append(i)`. This line appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since `pans` was initially an empty list, after executing this line, `pans` will contain one element, which is the value of `i`.

Given that `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its exact value, but we know it is being added to `pans`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`, `s` is the input string, `s` is not equal to `'<'`, and `s` is equal to `'='`**.
