To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` is greater than 0.

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `mak`: This variable is not mentioned in the initial state, so its value is unknown.
- `mak2`: This variable is also not mentioned in the initial state, so its value is unknown.
- `i`: This variable is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Let's denote the previous value of `i` as `i_prev`. Therefore, the current value of `i` is `i_prev + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will output a string starting with `'?'`.
- It will then output the value of `mak`, followed by the value of `mak2`.
- Next, it will output the current value of `i`, which is `i_prev + 1`.
- Finally, it will output the value of `mak2` again.

### Output Description:
Since the values of `mak` and `mak2` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i_prev + 1] [mak2] (where mak and mak2 are the values of the respective variables, and i_prev + 1 is the incremented value of i)**
