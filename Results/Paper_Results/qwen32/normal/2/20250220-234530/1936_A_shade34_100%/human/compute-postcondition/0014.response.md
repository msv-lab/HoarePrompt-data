The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its current value. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Given that `mak` is determined based on the input string and is not part of the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted here. Similarly, `t` is also not part of the loop head and does not need adjustment.

So, if `i` was some value `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i` if the input string was `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i` if the input string was `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, and `i` is now `i + 1`.**

To make this concrete, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i` if the input string was `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, and `i` is 4.**

Generalizing, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i` if the input string was `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Since we don't have the specific value of `i` from the previous iteration, we express the state in terms of the incremented `i`.
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i` if the input string was `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak` is `i` if the input string was `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
