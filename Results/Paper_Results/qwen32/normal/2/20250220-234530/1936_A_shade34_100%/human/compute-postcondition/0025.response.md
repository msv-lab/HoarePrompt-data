The code snippet assigns the value of `input()` converted to a string to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list, `s` is the input string.**
