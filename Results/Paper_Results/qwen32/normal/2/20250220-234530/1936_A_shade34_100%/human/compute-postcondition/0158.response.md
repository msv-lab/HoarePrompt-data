The code assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Given that `i` is 4, `mak` will now hold the value 4. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `mak` is 4, and `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`, `i` is 4**.
