The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this
- `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`
- `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`, or it remains unchanged unless `s` was `'='`, in which case `pans` contains the new value `i`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `s` is the string input by the user

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`, `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`, or it remains unchanged unless `s` was `'='`, in which case `pans` contains the new value `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the string input by the user, and `i` is now the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, so the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`**.

To simplify, we just need to adjust `i`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`, `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`, or it remains unchanged unless `s` was `'='`, in which case `pans` contains the new value `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the string input by the user, `i` is now the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

Since only `i` can be adjusted in the loop head:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1**.

So the final state considering only the variables in the loop head:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise in the context of the full state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`, `pans` is a list containing the current value of `i` if `s` was `'<'`, or it remains unchanged unless `s` was `'='`, in which case `pans` contains the new value `i`, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `s` is the string input by the user**.
