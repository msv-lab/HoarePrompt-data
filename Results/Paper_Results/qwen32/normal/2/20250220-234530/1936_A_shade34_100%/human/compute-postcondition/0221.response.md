Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of indices from 0 to n-1. It interacts with an external system by sending queries and receiving responses to determine specific indices based on comparison results. For each test case, it identifies and outputs two indices: one where a certain condition is met for the last time (`mak2`) and another within a subset of indices (`pans`) where a different condition is met for the last time (`mak`).**
