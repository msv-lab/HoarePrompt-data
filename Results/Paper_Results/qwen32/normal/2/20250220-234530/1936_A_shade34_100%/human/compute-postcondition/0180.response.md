To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The other variables (`t`, `mak2`, `mak`, and `pans`) are not directly controlled by the loop head and should remain as they are unless modified within the loop body (which is omitted here).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is greater than 0
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this
- `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received
- `pans` is a list. If `s` is `'<'`, then `mak` is updated to `i` and `pans` is set to `[i]`. If `s` is `'='`, `pans` is set to `[i]`. If `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `pans` remains an empty list.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has taken some value, and since the loop is about to iterate again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The variable `n` does not change; it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains the same.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `pans` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1**
