The given code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `mak` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 0**.
