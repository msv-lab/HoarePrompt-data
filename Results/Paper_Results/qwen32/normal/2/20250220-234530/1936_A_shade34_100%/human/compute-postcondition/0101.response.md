The code snippet `pans = [i]` assigns a new list containing the single element `i` to the variable `pans`. This means `pans` is no longer an empty list but now holds the value `[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `mak`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Given that `s` is currently `'<'`, and `mak` is set to the current index `i`, we infer that `i` is the index at which the character `'<'` was encountered in the input string `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `pans` is `[i]`; `mak` is now equal to the current index `i`; `s` is the input string and its current value is `'<'`.**
