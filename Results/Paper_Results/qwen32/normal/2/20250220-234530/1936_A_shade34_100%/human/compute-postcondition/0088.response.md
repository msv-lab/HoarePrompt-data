To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable does not directly affect the `print` statement.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1. This variable also does not directly affect the `print` statement.
- `mak2` is initialized to 0. This variable does not appear in the `print` statement.
- `pans` is a list that contains all indices `i` for which the input was `'='`. It may also contain the last index `i` for which the input was `'<'`. This variable does not directly affect the `print` statement.
- `mak` is set to `i` if the input was `'<'`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0. The value of `mak` depends on the input during the execution of the program.
- `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. This means `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of a loop.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

The output will be:
- The character `'?'`.
- The value of `mak` (which could be 0 or the last index `i` where the input was `'<'`).
- The value of `mak` again (same as the second item).
- The value of `i` (which is the current index in the loop).
- The value of `i` again (same as the fourth item).

Since the exact value of `mak` and `i` depend on the specific inputs during the execution of the program, we can only describe their roles and not their exact values without additional context.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] (where [mak] is the last index i where the input was '<', or 0 if no such input was encountered, and [i] is the current index in the loop)**
