The code snippet assigns the list `[i]` to the variable `pans`. Given that `s` is the input string which is `'<'`, and `i` is the current index (which is not explicitly defined in the snippet but implied to be the current iteration index in a loop), `pans` will now hold a list containing the current index `i`.

Since the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `mak` are not modified by the code snippet, they retain their initial values. The only change is that `pans` is updated to contain the list `[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this, `mak` is `i`, `pans` is `[i]`, and `s` is the input string which is `'<'`.**
