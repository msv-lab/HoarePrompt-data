The value of `mak` is updated to the current index `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `pans` is an empty list; `mak` is now equal to the current index `i`; `s` is the input string and its current value is `'<'`.
