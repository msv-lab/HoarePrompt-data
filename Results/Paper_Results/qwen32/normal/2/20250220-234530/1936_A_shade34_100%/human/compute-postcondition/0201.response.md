To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the code and analyze the variables involved:

1. **Variables and Initial State**:
   - `mak` is initialized to 0.
   - `mak2` is initialized to 0 (though it is not used in the print statement).
   - `pans` is a list with at least two elements.

2. **Print Statement Analysis**:
   - The print statement is: `print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`
   - We know `mak` is 0, so `pans[mak]` translates to `pans[0]`, which is the first element of the list `pans`.
   - The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means it is undefined and will raise a `NameError` if the code tries to execute as is. However, since the task is to determine the output based on the given information, we'll assume `i` is intended to be another valid index within the bounds of the list `pans`.

Given the above analysis, the output will depend on the actual values in the list `pans` and the value of `i`. Since `i` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value, but we can describe the output in terms of `pans[0]` and `pans[i]`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [first element of pans] [first element of pans] [element at index i of pans] [element at index i of pans] (where i is an undefined index in the list pans)**

However, if we assume `i` is also 0 (as a common default assumption when the index is not specified), then the output would be:
Output: **? [first element of pans] [first element of pans] [first element of pans] [first element of pans]**
