The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `mak2`, `mak`, and `pans`) are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received
- `mak` is the highest index `i` in `pans` (from index 1 to the end) for which the input response was `'>'`, or 0 if no such response was received
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`

After executing the code, the only variable that changes is `n`, which now holds the value of the integer input provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is the integer input provided by the user; `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `mak` is the highest index `i` in `pans` (from index 1 to the end) for which the input response was `'>'`, or 0 if no such response was received; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` where the input was `'='`**
