To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and the length of `pans`.

Here's the given loop:
```python
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will iterate over the indices of `pans` starting from 1 up to (but not including) `len(pans)`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `len(pans)` must be greater than 1. This ensures that there is at least one valid index `i` (which would be 1) for the loop to start.

### Adjustments:
- `mak` and `mak2` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
- `pans` must have at least two elements to ensure that the loop runs at least once.

### Final State:
State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list with at least two elements**
