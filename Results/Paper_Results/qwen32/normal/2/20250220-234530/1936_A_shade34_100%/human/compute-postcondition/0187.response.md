Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received prior to this, `mak` is the highest index `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received, `pans` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is the string input by the user. If `s` equals `'='`, `pans` contains the new value `i`.**
