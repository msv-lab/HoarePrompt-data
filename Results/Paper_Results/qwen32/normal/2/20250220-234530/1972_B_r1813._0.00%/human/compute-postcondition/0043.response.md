Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "U" and "D". For each test case, the function returns the count of contiguous segments in the string `s` where all characters are the same ("U" or "D").**
