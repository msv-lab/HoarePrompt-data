The code modifies the value of `q` by dividing it by `gcd`. Since `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, this operation simplifies `q` to its reduced form relative to `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the total sum of all `f` values read from the input, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the last set of values read from the input, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2 // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**
