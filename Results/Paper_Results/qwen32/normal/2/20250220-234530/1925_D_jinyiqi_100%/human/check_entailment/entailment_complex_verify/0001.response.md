### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided solution's formula is incorrect for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values over multiple excursions. Let's delve deeper into why the formula is flawed and whether the solution can be salvaged or if it fundamentally misunderstands the problem.

#### Problem Understanding

The core of the problem is to compute the expected sum of friendship values when pairs of children are chosen randomly for excursions. The friendship values evolve over time as pairs are chosen repeatedly. Here are the critical points:

1. **Initial Friendship Values:** Given pairs of friends with initial friendship values.
2. **Random Selection:** Pairs are chosen randomly with replacement for `k` excursions.
3. **Friendship Value Update:** If a selected pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for future selections.
4. **Expected Value Calculation:** Compute the expected sum of friendship values at the time of selection for all `k` excursions.

#### Flawed Formula Analysis

The provided solution uses the following formula:
- Numerator \( p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \)
- Denominator \( q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2 \)

This formula does not accurately capture the expected value because:
- **Initial Contribution:** The term \( 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} \) incorrectly assumes that the initial friendship values contribute linearly to the expected sum without accounting for the probability of selecting each pair.
- **Incremental Contribution:** The term \( m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \) incorrectly assumes that each pair's friendship value increases by 1 for every subsequent selection, which is not the case due to the probabilistic nature of the selections.

#### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve:
1. **Probability of Selection:** Calculate the probability of selecting each pair in each excursion.
2. **Expected Increment:** Compute the expected increment in friendship values for each pair over `k` excursions.
3. **Dynamic Programming:** Use dynamic programming to keep track of the expected friendship values for each pair as excursions progress.

Given the complexity of the correct approach, the provided solution's formula is fundamentally flawed and cannot be corrected without a significant overhaul.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided solution is incorrect due to the flawed formula used to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

**Final: False**
