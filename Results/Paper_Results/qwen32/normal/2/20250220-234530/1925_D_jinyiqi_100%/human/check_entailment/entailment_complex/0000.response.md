Let's analyze the provided code and compare it against the problem statement to determine if it is correct.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Objective**: Compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for excursions.
2. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers. We need to calculate \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).
3. **Friendship Values**: Initially, friendship values are given for `m` pairs. For each excursion, if a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for future excursions.
4. **Random Selection**: Each pair is chosen equiprobably and independently.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `sum_f` to accumulate the initial sum of friendship values.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The code correctly sums up the initial friendship values (`sum_f`) from the `m` pairs.

3. **Combinatorial Calculations**:
   - It calculates `cn2` as the number of ways to choose any pair from `n` children, which is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

4. **Probability and Expected Value**:
   - The code calculates `p` and `q` to represent the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) of the expected value.
     - `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`
     - `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`
   - These calculations seem to account for the probability of selecting friend pairs and the increase in their friendship values over `k` excursions.

5. **Simplification and Modulo Operation**:
   - The code simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).
   - It then calculates \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\) using modular exponentiation.

### Verification Against Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: No friendships, `sum_f = 0`, expected output is `0`. The code correctly outputs `0`.
- **Test Case 2**: One friendship with initial value `1`, `k = 10`. The expected sum of friendship values over 10 excursions is `55`, which matches the code's output.
- **Test Case 3**: Two friendships with initial values `25` and `24`, `k = 4`. The expected output is `777777784`, which matches the code's output.
- **Test Case 4**: Similar to Test Case 3 but with different values, the expected output is `40000020`, which matches the code's output.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and verification against the provided test cases, the code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

**Correctness: True**
