### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to see if it correctly computes the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines containing the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**: The code calculates the sum of the initial friendship values of all friend pairs (`sum_f`).

3. **Total Possible Pairs**: The code calculates the total number of possible pairs of children (`cn2`), which is given by the combination formula \( C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The numerator `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`.
   - The denominator `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

5. **Simplification and Modulo Operation**:
   - The code simplifies the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`).
   - Finally, it calculates the modular inverse of `q` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) and multiplies it with `p` to get the final result.

### Analysis of the Formula:

The formula used in the code seems to be incorrect based on the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

- The numerator `p` should account for the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions. The current formula does not correctly represent this.
- The denominator `q` should be the total number of ways to choose `k` pairs out of `cn2` pairs, but the current formula does not reflect this.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. This involves:

1. Calculating the probability of selecting each friend pair in each excursion.
2. Summing up the expected contributions of each friend pair over `k` excursions.

The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions is:

\[ E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \left(1 + \frac{k-1}{cn2}\right) \]

Where:
- \( f_i \) is the initial friendship value of the i-th friend pair.
- \( cn2 \) is the total number of possible pairs.
- \( \frac{k-1}{cn2} \) is the expected number of times the friendship value of the i-th pair increases over `k` excursions.

The expected value can be simplified to:

\[ E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \left(\frac{k \cdot cn2 + (k-1)}{cn2}\right) \]

\[ E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \left(\frac{k \cdot cn2 + k - 1}{cn2}\right) \]

\[ E = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \left(\frac{k \cdot (cn2 + 1) - 1}{cn2}\right) \]

Finally, we need to compute the modular inverse of `cn2` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) and multiply it with the numerator to get the result.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the code is:

Correctness: **False**
