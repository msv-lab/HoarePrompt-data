To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `j` and `m`.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1 because `range(m)` generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `m`. If `m` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the first input integer
- `m` is the second input integer
- `k` is the third input integer
- `sum_f` is 0
- `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd`
- `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`
- `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`

We need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop as per the loop head.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `m` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is 0, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`**
