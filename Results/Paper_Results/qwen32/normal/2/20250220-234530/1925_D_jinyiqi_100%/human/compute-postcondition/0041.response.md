To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the expression and the variables involved:

### Variables and Their Definitions:
- `t`: An input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4 (number of test cases).
- `i`: Initialized to 1 (likely used as a loop counter).
- `n`: The first input integer (likely the number of elements in a set or list).
- `m`: The second input integer (possibly a multiplier or another parameter).
- `k`: The third input integer (possibly another multiplier or parameter).
- `sum_f`: The total sum of all `f` values read from the input (where `f` could be a frequency or some other value).
- `cn2`: Calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2` (number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items, also known as "n choose 2").
- `a`, `b`, `f`: The last set of values read from the input (likely coordinates and a frequency or value associated with them).
- `p`: Calculated as `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
- `q`: Calculated as `2 * cn2 // gcd`.
- `gcd`: The greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

### Expression Breakdown:
The `print` statement contains the following expression:
```python
int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)
```

- `pow(q, -1, M)`: This computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `M`. In other words, it finds an integer `x` such that `(q * x) % M == 1`.
- `p * pow(q, -1, M)`: This multiplies `p` by the modular multiplicative inverse of `q` modulo `M`.
- `int(... % M)`: This takes the result of the multiplication and reduces it modulo `M` to ensure the final result is within the range `[0, M-1]`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the integer result of the expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)`. Given the definitions and calculations above, this value is derived from the modular arithmetic operations involving `p`, `q`, and `M`.

Since the exact values of `p`, `q`, and `M` are not provided in the initial state, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the computed result of the expression.

Output: **result (where result is the integer value of int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))**
