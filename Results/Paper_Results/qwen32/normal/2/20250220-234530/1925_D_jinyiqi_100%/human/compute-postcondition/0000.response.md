Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the next `m` lines contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, where `a_i` ≠ `b_i`, 1 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `f_i` ≤ 10^9. All pairs (`a_i`, `b_i`) are distinct. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The sum of `k` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state description and have not been modified by the provided code snippet.
