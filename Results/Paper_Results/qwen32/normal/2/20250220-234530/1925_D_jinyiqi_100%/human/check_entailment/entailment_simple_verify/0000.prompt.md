You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   The formula used in the program to compute `p` and `q` is incorrect. The expected value calculation should consider the probability of selecting a friend pair versus a non-friend pair and how the friendship values evolve over the k excursions.

2. **Handling of Friendship Values**:
   The program simply sums up the initial friendship values and uses them in a way that does not reflect the dynamic nature of friendship values increasing over excursions. Specifically, the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time that pair is chosen, which needs to be factored into the expected value calculation.

3. **Probability Considerations**:
   The probability of choosing a friend pair in any given excursion is `m / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`, and the probability of choosing a non-friend pair is `(n * (n - 1) / 2 - m) / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`. These probabilities need to be used to correctly compute the expected value.

Here is a simplified explanation of the correct approach:
- For each friend pair, calculate the expected contribution to the sum of friendship values over k excursions.
- For each non-friend pair, the expected contribution is 0 initially but changes as the friendship value increases.
- Use these contributions to compute the overall expected value and convert it to the required modular inverse form.

Given these issues, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and will not produce the correct results for all potential cases.
