The given Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. This affects the values of `a`, `b`, and `f`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains the first input integer.
- `m` remains greater than 0.
- `k` remains the third input integer.
- `sum_f` was `sum_f + f` before, now it becomes `sum_f + f` (where `f` is the newly read value).
- `cn2` remains `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `a`, `b`, and `f` are now the newly read values from the input.
- `p` remains `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`.
- `q` remains `2 * cn2 // gcd`.
- `gcd` remains the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
- `j` remains incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f` (where `f` is the newly read value), `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the newly read values from the input, `p` is `(2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2 // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `j` is incremented by 1.**
