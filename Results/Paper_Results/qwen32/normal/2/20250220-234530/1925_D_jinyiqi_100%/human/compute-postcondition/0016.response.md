The given code calculates the value of `p` using the formula `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`. Here, `cn2` is already calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `sum_f` remain unchanged except for the newly computed `p`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`**.
