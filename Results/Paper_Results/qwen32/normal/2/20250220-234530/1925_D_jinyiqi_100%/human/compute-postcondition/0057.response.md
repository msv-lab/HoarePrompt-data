The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `q`. Specifically, `q` is updated to be `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

Given the initial state, the only change is the value of `q`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values read during the `m` iterations, `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the values read during the last iteration, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * cn2 ** 2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the new `p` and `q`.**
