Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440. For each test case, it receives a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm). The function returns a result for each test case indicating whether the given time is during the day or night. Specifically, if the time is between 06:00 and 18:00 (inclusive), it returns "day"; otherwise, it returns "night".**
