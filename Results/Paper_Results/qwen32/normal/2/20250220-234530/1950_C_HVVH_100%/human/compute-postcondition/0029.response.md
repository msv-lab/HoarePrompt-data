Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `h` and `m` are the new hour and minute values read from the input. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is adjusted to `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.**
