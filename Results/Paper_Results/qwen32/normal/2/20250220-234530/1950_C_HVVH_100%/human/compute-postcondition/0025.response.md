The given code snippet only changes the value of the `day` variable to `'AM'`. No other variables are modified by this single line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `h`, `m`, and the previous determination of `day` based on `h` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `h` and `m` are the new hour and minute values read from the input, `day` is 'AM'**.
