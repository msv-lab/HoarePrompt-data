To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and how it affects the variables `h`, `m`, and `day`.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`:** 
   - An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440. This represents the number of minutes past midnight.

2. **Variable `s`:**
   - A string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (e.g., "13:45").

3. **Variable `n`:**
   - Initially greater than 0, but is now `n-1`. This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output.

4. **Variables `h` and `m`:**
   - These are the new hour and minute values read from the input. The exact values of `h` and `m` are not specified in the initial state, but they are derived from the time string `s`.

5. **Variable `day`:**
   - This variable is determined based on the value of `h`:
     - If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is adjusted to `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is 12, `day` is 'PM'.
     - Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM'.

### Deriving Values of `h` and `m`:

Given that `s` is a string in 24-hour format, we can split it into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`). For example, if `s` is "13:45", then `h` would be 13 and `m` would be 45.

### Adjusting `h` and Determining `day`:

- If `h` is 0, adjust `h` to 12 and set `day` to 'AM'.
- If `h` is between 1 and 11, keep `h` as is and set `day` to 'AM'.
- If `h` is 12, keep `h` as is and set `day` to 'PM'.
- If `h` is between 13 and 23, adjust `h` to `h - 12` and set `day` to 'PM'.

### Example Calculation:

Let's assume `s` is "13:45". Here's how `h`, `m`, and `day` would be determined:

- `h` = 13
- `m` = 45
- Since `h` is greater than 12, adjust `h` to `h - 12` which gives `h` = 1, and set `day` to 'PM'.

### Print Statement:

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This will format `h` and `m` to always be two digits, padding with zeros if necessary, and then print them followed by the `day`.

### Output:

Using the example where `s` is "13:45", the output would be:
Output: **01:45 PM**

However, since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we need to describe the output in terms of `h` and `m`:

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day} (where h and m are derived from the input time string s and day is determined based on the rules provided)**

But if we consider a specific example like "13:45" for clarity:
Output: **01:45 PM**
