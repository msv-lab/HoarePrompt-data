Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `h` is 12, `m` are the new minute values read from the input, `day` is 'PM'.**

Explanation: The value of `h` is set to 12, and since `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'PM'. All other variables remain unchanged.
