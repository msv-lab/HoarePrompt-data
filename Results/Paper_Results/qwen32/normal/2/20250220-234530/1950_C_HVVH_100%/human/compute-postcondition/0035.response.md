The value of `h` is decremented by 12. The values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is greater than 0, `h` is the original value of `h` minus 12, `m` is unchanged.**
