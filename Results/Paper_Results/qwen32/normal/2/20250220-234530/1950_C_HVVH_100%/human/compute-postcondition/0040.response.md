Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `n` is greater than 0, `h` and `m` are the new hour and minute values read from the input. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is set to `'PM'`. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to `'PM'`. Otherwise, `day` remains `'AM'`.**
