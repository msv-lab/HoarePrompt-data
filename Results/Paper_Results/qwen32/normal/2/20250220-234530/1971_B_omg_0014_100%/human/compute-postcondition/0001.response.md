To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop's header. In this case, the loop header is:

```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables involved in the loop header are `i` and `n`. The variable `i` is the loop counter, and `n` determines how many times the loop will iterate.

### Analysis:
- **Variable `i`:** This variable is automatically initialized by the `range(n)` function and does not need to be set manually before the loop starts. It will take on values from 0 up to (but not including) `n`.
- **Variable `n`:** This variable controls the number of iterations of the loop. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `n` is an input integer.

### Necessary Adjustments:
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The current state does not specify any condition on `n`, so we need to adjust it to ensure `n > 0`.

### Final State:
- `t` remains as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` remains as a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than 0**
