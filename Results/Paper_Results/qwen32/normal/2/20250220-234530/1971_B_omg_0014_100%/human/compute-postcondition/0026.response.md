Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the new string input by the user, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the string `s`, `i` is `i_end + 1`. If `a` contains exactly one unique character, the conditions remain as specified in the if part. Otherwise, `b` is the sorted string of `s`, and `c` is the sorted string of `s` in reverse order.**
