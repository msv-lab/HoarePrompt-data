You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase English letters. For each string, it checks if all characters are identical. If they are, it outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES' and then prints the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string, depending on whether the original string is already in lexicographically smallest order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to rearrange the characters of the input string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.
- If it's impossible to do so, we should output "NO".
- Otherwise, we should output "YES" followed by one possible rearrangement of the string.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the input string `s`.
2. Checks if all characters in `s` are the same using a set (`a = set(s)`).
   - If the length of the set is 1, it means all characters are the same, and it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and attempts to create a different arrangement of the string.
3. It sorts the string in ascending order (`b = ''.join(sorted(s))`) and in descending order (`c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))`).
4. If the original string `s` is the same as the sorted string `b`, it prints the reversed sorted string `c`.
5. Otherwise, it prints the sorted string `b`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program assumes that sorting the string in ascending or descending order will always produce a different string if the original string has more than one unique character. This is generally true, but let's consider edge cases:
  - If the input string is already sorted in ascending or descending order and has more than one unique character, the program might still output a string that is different from the original.
  - However, the program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted in ascending order and reversing it would result in the same string (which is not possible with distinct characters, but let's ensure this is covered).

### Edge Cases:
- Consider the string "abc", which is already sorted in ascending order. The program will sort it again in ascending order and print "abc", which is incorrect.
- Consider the string "cba", which is sorted in descending order. The program will sort it in ascending order and print "abc", which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle most cases correctly, but there's a potential issue with strings that are already sorted in ascending order. Let's verify this:

- For the string "abc":
  - `b` will be "abc".
  - Since `b` is equal to `s`, it will print `c` which is "cba".
  - This is correct.

- For the string "cba":
  - `b` will be "abc".
  - Since `b` is not equal to `s`, it will print `b` which is "abc".
  - This is correct.

- For the string "aabbcc":
  - `b` will be "aabbcc".
  - Since `b` is equal to `s`, it will print `c` which is "ccbbaa".
  - This is correct.

Given these checks, the program appears to handle all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all edge cases by checking if the string can be rearranged to a different permutation. If the string is already sorted in ascending order, it reverses the sorted string to ensure it is different from the original. If the string has all identical characters, it correctly outputs "NO".
