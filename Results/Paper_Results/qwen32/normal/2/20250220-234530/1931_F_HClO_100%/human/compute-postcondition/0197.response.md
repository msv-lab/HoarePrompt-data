Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` must be at least 3, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `i` is 3, `idx1` is 3 if `l1[i + p1] == a2` otherwise `idx2` is 3, `p1` is 1 if `l1[i + p1] == a2` otherwise `p2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `t` is incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement is broken out of. The values of `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is 3. The values of `idx1` and `idx2` depend on whether `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`. If it does, `idx1` is set to 3 and `p1` is set to 1; otherwise, `idx2` is set to 3 and `p2` is set to 1.
