Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `m` is set to 5.
- `n` is an integer read from the input.
- `a1` is the first integer from the new input line.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line.
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input line.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`.
- `l11` is not equal to `l22`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('no')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'no'`. The values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, and `l22` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply `'no'`.

Output: **no**
