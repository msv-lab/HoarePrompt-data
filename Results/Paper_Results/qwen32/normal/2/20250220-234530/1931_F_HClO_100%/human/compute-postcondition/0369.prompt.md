Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged unless `m` was initially 2 and `idx1 <= idx2`, in which case `m` becomes `m - 1`. `t` is incremented by `m - 2` for each iteration. `val` is an empty list unless `idx1 <= idx2`, in which case `val` contains the tuple `(a3, l3)`. `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop. `a1` and `a2` are unchanged. `l1` and `l2` are unchanged unless `idx1 <= idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, in which case `a1` is inserted at `idx2` in `l1`; otherwise, `a2` is inserted at `idx1` in `l2`. `l11` and `l22` are unchanged. `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes all iterations. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1`. If `idx1 <= idx2`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2` and `a3` is the first integer from the input, while `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. `l` is either `l1` or `l2` depending on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` if `idx1 <= idx2`; otherwise, `l` is equal to `l1` if `idx1 < idx2`. If `idx2` was `-1` and `idx1` was not `-1`, then `idx2` is now `n - 2`; otherwise, `idx2` remains unchanged. If `idx1` was `-1` and `idx2` was not `-1`, then `idx1` is now `n - 2`; otherwise, `idx1` remains `-1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is unchanged, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` includes the new tuple `(a3, l3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is unchanged, `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is unchanged, `m` is 5, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` three times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
