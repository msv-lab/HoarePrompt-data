The code appends the tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains the tuple `(a3, l3)` twice. After appending, `val` will contain the tuple `(a3, l3)` three times.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is 5, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `val` includes the tuple `(a3, l3)` three times.**
