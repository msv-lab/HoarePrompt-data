Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` compared to its value at the end of the previous iteration, `val` is an empty list if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `val` remains as `m - 2` tuples (a3, l3). If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is `i`, and `idx2` is -1. Otherwise, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is -1, and `idx2` is `i`. Additionally, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1` or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` unless `l1[i + p1] == a2`. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
