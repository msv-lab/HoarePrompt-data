The code snippet assigns the value of `l1` to `l`. This means that `l` now holds the same list as `l1`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 2 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`.**
