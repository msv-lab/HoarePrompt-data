The given Python code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the first integer to `a3` while the rest of the integers are collected into the list `l3`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, or `val`.

Given the initial state and the operation performed by the code, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line excluding the first integer.**
