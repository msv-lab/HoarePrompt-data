Postcondition: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `t` is incremented by `m - 2` for each iteration, `val` is an empty list, `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop, `a1` and `a2` are unchanged, `l1` and `l2` are unchanged, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `i` is `n-2` if the loop completes all iterations, `idx1` is less than `idx2`. If `idx2` was `-1` and `idx1` was not `-1`, then `idx2` is now `n - 2`; otherwise, `idx2` remains unchanged. If `idx1` was `-1` and `idx2` was not `-1`, then `idx1` is now `n - 2`; otherwise, `idx1` remains `-1`.**
