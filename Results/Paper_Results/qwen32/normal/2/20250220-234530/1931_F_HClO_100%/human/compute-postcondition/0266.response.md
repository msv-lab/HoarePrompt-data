The code creates a new list `l22` by filtering out elements from `l2` that are equal to `a1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `t` is incremented by 1 compared to its value at the end of the previous iteration, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples (a3, l3), `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.**
