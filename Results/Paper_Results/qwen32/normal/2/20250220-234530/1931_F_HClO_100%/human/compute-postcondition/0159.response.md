Output State: **`t` is incremented by 1, `n` must be at least 2, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding those equal to `a1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
