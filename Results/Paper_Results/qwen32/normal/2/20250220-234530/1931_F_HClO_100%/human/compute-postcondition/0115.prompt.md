Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1. `n` is an integer read from the input. `a1` is the first integer from the new input line. `l1` is a list of integers. `a2` is the first integer from the new input line. `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`. `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`. `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1. `idx2` is not -1. `p1` is 0. `p2` is 0. `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `idx1 < idx2`, `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `l` is the same as `l2`. If `idx1 > idx2`, `l1` is a list of integers with `a1` inserted at `idx2`. If `idx1 == idx2`, `m` is 1 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 0, and `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; otherwise, `l2` has `a2` inserted at the position `idx1`, and `l` is a list that holds the same value as `l2`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line excluding the first integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing two tuples `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line excluding the first integer, `_` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing three tuples `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line excluding the first integer, `_` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
