Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is 5, `t` is incremented by 9, `val` contains the next tuple `(a5, l5)`, `a1` and `a2` are unchanged, `l1` and `l2` are updated based on the indices of `a1` and `a2` in `l3` if `idx1 <= idx2`, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` may have changed based on specific conditions, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing any of the variable values. Thus, all variables retain their previous states except that the loop or if statement is terminated.
