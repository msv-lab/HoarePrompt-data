The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, which is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.**
