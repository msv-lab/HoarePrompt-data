The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `val`. None of the other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list.**
