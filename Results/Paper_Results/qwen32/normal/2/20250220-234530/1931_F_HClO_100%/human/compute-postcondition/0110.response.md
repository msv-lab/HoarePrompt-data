The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, assigns the first integer to `a3`, and the rest to `l3`. 

Given the initial state, the only variables that will be affected are `a3` and `l3`. The values of `a3` and `l3` will be determined by the new input line.

Let's assume the new input line is `x y1 y2 ... yk`, where `x` is the first integer and `y1, y2, ..., yk` are the remaining integers.

After executing the code snippet:
- `a3` will be assigned the value `x`.
- `l3` will be assigned the list `[y1, y2, ..., yk]`.

All other variables (`t`, `m`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5, `n` is an integer read from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is either `n - 2` or -1, `idx2` is not -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line excluding the first integer, `_` is 1**.
