The code snippet `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a2` and the rest to `l2`.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, and `l1` remain unchanged. The new input is processed, and `a2` is assigned the first integer from this new input, while `l2` is assigned the list of the remaining integers.

Output State: **The loop completes all iterations and prints 'yes'. `t` is incremented by 1. `n` remains the first integer from the input. `m` remains the second integer from the input. `a1` is the first integer from the new input. `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input. `a2` is the first integer from the latest input. `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input.**
