Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` is at least 2, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, and `i` is `i_end + 2`. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, no changes are made to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`, and the loop or if statement continues. If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i_end + 2` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, if `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, `idx1` is set to `i_end + 2` if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, otherwise `idx2` is set to `i_end + 2`, `p1` is set to 1 if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, otherwise `p2` is set to 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If either `idx1` or `idx2` is negative, no changes are made to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`, and the loop or if statement continues.**
