The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(a3, l3)` and the list `val`. Therefore, we can only adjust these for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `val` is a list containing at least one tuple, specifically `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`.
- The condition checks if `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- After each iteration, the loop moves to the next tuple in `val`.
- Since `val` contains at least three tuples, there will be at least two more iterations possible before the loop ends.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop was working with the last tuple `(a3, l3)` from the list `val`. For the loop to execute one more time, it should move to the next tuple in `val`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `val` remains the same, but the current tuple `(a3, l3)` should be the next tuple in the list.

Since the list `val` contains at least three tuples, the next tuple `(a3, l3)` will be the second last tuple in the list.

State: **`val` is a list containing at least one tuple, specifically `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, and the current tuple `(a3, l3)` is the second last tuple in the list.** 

However, to be more precise and align with the loop's natural progression, we should specify the exact tuple:

State: **`val` is a list containing at least one tuple, specifically `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, and the current tuple `(a3, l3)` is the second tuple in the list.**
