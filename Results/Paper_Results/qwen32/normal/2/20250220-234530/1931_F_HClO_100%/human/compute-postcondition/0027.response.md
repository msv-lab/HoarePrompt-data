Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `m` is 5 if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, otherwise `m` remains 1, `n` must be at least 2, `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
