The code takes the string representation of `t` (which is `s`) and creates a new string `s2` by randomly shuffling the characters of `s`. The length of `s2` remains the same as `s`.

Since `s` is the string representation of `t` and `random.sample(s, len(s))` shuffles the characters of `s`, `s2` will be a permutation of the digits in `s`.

Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` will be a string of length 1 to 4 characters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is equal to the string representation of `t`, `s2` is a permutation of the characters in `s`.**
