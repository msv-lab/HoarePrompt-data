In this task, we are given the following initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is the new user's input.
- `s2` is a random permutation of the characters in the original `s`.

The Python code snippet provided is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

Let's analyze the print statement:

The print statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`. This string does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `s`, or `s2`. It is a constant string.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
