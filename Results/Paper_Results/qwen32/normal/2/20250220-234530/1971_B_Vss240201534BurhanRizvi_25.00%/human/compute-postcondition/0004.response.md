Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `s` is the string representation of `t`.
- `s2` is a permutation of the characters in `s`, and `s` is not equal to `s2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, or `s2`. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Explanation:
- The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
- `s` is the string representation of `t`, meaning if `t` is 123, then `s` would be `'123'`.
- `s2` is a permutation of the characters in `s` and is not equal to `s`. For example, if `s` is `'123'`, `s2` could be `'321'` or `'213'`, but it cannot be `'123'`.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `s`, `s2`) are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
