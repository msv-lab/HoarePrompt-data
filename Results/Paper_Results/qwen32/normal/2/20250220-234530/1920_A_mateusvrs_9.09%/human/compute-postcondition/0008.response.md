The code reads a pair of integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `r`, `cx`, `ax`, or `bx`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `r` is an empty list; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is -1; `a` and `x` are the integers read from the input where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.**
