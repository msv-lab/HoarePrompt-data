Postcondition: **`bx` is the maximum value of `x` when `a` is `1`, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` when `a` is `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` when `a` is neither `1` nor `2`, `n` is the input integer, and `r` includes `1000000009`. If `bx >= ax`, then `r` includes `1000000009` and possibly `0`. Otherwise, `r` includes `1000000009`, `0`, and `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
