The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. The values of `bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bx` is `-1`, `ax` is `1000000007`, `cx` is an empty set, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` includes the element `1000000009`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input`.**
