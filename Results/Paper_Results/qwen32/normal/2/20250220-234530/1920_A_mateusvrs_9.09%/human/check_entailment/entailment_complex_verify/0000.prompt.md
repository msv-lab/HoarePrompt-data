You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of several constraints defined by pairs (a, x). It calculates and outputs an integer for each test case based on the constraints, specifically focusing on the relationship between the maximum value of type 1 constraints (`bx`) and the minimum value of type 2 constraints (`ax`). If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it counts how many type 3 constraints fall within the range [bx, ax] and outputs the difference between the range size and this count.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints.
- Constraints can be of three types:
  1. `k` must be greater than or equal to some integer `x`.
  2. `k` must be less than or equal to some integer `x`.
  3. `k` must be not equal to some integer `x`.

### Program Analysis
The program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then processes each constraint to determine the valid range for `k` and the values that `k` cannot take.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `cx`: A set to store values that `k` cannot be (`a == 3`).
   - `ax`: Initially set to a large value (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the upper bound.
   - `bx`: Initially set to `-1` to represent the lower bound.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint:
     - If `a == 1`, update `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, update `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, add `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Determining Valid Range**:
   - If `bx >= ax`, it means there is no valid range for `k` (impossible constraints), so append `0` to the results.
   - Otherwise, calculate the number of valid integers in the range `[bx, ax]` excluding those in `cx`.

### Potential Issues
- The logic seems correct in terms of processing constraints and determining the valid range.
- However, there is a subtle issue in the condition `if bx >= ax:`. This condition checks if the lower bound is greater than or equal to the upper bound, which would mean no valid `k` exists. But the condition should be `if bx > ax:` because `bx` and `ax` should be strictly different for there to be no valid `k`.

### Edge Cases
- **No Valid Range**: When `bx > ax`, the program correctly returns `0`.
- **Valid Range with No Exclusions**: When there are no `a == 3` constraints, the program correctly calculates the range size.
- **Valid Range with Exclusions**: When there are `a == 3` constraints, the program correctly excludes these values from the range.

### Correctness Check
Given the above analysis, the only issue is the condition `if bx >= ax:`. It should be `if bx > ax:` to correctly handle the case where the lower and upper bounds are exactly the same but still valid.

### Conclusion
Since there is a logical error in the condition checking for the valid range, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation
The program incorrectly handles the case where `bx` equals `ax`. It should only return `0` if `bx > ax`, not if `bx >= ax`. This is a critical edge case that the program fails to handle correctly.
