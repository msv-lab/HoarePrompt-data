Postcondition: **`bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` contains `{x}`. `n` is greater than 0, `r` includes the element 1000000009, `a` is the first integer from the input, and `x` is the second integer from the input.**
