Postcondition: **`bx` is -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `1000000007` if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is `1000000007`. `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` includes the new element 1000000009, `a` is an integer not equal to 1, and `x` is the second integer from the input.**
