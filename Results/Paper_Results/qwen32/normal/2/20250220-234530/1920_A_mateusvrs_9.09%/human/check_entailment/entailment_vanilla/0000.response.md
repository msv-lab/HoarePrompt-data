Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - It initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes:
     - `cx` as an empty set to store values that `k` cannot be (type 3 constraints).
     - `ax` to a large value (`1000000000 + 7`) to keep track of the maximum upper bound (type 2 constraints).
     - `bx` to `-1` to keep track of the minimum lower bound (type 1 constraints).

3. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - Depending on the type of constraint:
     - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and `x` (to ensure `k` is at least `x`).
     - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and `x` (to ensure `k` is at most `x`).
     - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (values `k` cannot be).

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx >= ax`. If true, it means there is no valid `k` that satisfies all constraints (since the lower bound is greater than or equal to the upper bound), so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.

5. **Counting Valid `k` Values**:
   - If `bx < ax`, it calculates the total number of integers between `bx` and `ax` inclusive (`ax - bx + 1`).
   - It then subtracts the count of integers in `cx` that fall within this range to get the number of valid `k` values.
   - This result is appended to the result list `r`.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints all the results stored in `r`, separated by newlines.

### Correctness Evaluation

- The program correctly processes each type of constraint and maintains the necessary bounds and exclusions.
- It handles the feasibility check (`bx >= ax`) correctly to determine if there are any valid `k` values.
- The calculation of valid `k` values by subtracting excluded values within the range is also correct.
- The program adheres to the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically correct and should produce the expected results for all valid inputs as per the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
