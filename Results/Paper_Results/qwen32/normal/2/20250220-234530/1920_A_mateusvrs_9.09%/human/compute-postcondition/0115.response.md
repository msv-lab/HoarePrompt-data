The given code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This means the values of `a` and `x` will be updated based on the input provided.

Given the initial state, the values of `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` depend on the values of `a` and `x`. Since `a` and `x` are being reassigned from the input, the conditions that determine `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` will be evaluated using these new values.

However, since the new values of `a` and `x` are coming from the input, we cannot determine their exact values without knowing the input. Therefore, we can only describe the output state in terms of these new values.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` contains `{x}`, `n` is greater than 1, `r` includes the element 1000000009.**
