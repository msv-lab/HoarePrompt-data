The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Given the initial conditions, if `a` is 1 or 2, `cx` starts as an empty set. Otherwise, `cx` starts with the value `x`. After executing `cx.add(x)`, `cx` will definitely contain `x`.

Here's the updated state:

- `a` remains the first integer from the input.
- `x` remains the second integer from the input.
- `n` remains `n + 1`.
- `r` includes the new element `1000000009`.
- `bx` remains `max(x, -1)`.
- `ax` remains `1000000007` if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `ax` remains `min(x, 1000000007)`.
- `cx` now contains `x` (if `a` was 1 or 2, it transitions from an empty set to a set containing `x`; if `a` was not 1 or 2, `cx` remains unchanged as it already contained `x`).

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `n` is `n + 1`, `r` includes the new element `1000000009`, `bx` is `max(x, -1)`, `ax` is `1000000007` if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`, and `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
