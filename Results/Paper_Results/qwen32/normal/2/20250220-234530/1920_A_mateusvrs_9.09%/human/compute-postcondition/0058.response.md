The code snippet `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `x`. Given that `bx` is initially `-1` and `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` will be updated to `x` if `x` is greater than `-1`. Otherwise, `bx` remains `-1`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we consider two cases:
1. If `x` is greater than `-1`, then `bx` becomes `x`.
2. If `x` is less than or equal to `-1`, then `bx` remains `-1`.

However, since `x` is described as "the second integer from the input" and no constraints are given that would make `x` less than or equal to `-1`, we assume the more general case where `x` could be any integer. Thus, `bx` will be updated to `max(x, -1)`.

Output State: **`a` is 1, `bx` is `max(x, -1)`, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` includes the new element 1000000009, `x` is the second integer from the input.**
