The code appends the value `0` to the list `r`. The values of `bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `n`, and the initial elements of `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was `1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was `2`, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values encountered when `a` was `3`, `n` is `0`, and `r` includes the elements `[1000000009, 0]`. Additionally, `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`.**
