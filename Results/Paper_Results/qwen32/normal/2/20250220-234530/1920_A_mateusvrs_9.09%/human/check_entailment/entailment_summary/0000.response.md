### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it initializes `cx` as a set to store values from type 3 constraints, `ax` to a large number (representing the minimum value of type 2 constraints), and `bx` to a small number (representing the maximum value of type 1 constraints).

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint `(a, x)`:
     - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`. This ensures `bx` holds the largest value among all type 1 constraints.
     - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`. This ensures `ax` holds the smallest value among all type 2 constraints.
     - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Determining Valid Range**:
   - After processing all constraints for a test case, the program checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If true, it means there is no valid range for `k` because the minimum allowable value (`bx`) exceeds the maximum allowable value (`ax`), so it appends `0` to the result list.
   - If `bx < ax`, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that do not violate any type 3 constraints. This is done by counting how many elements in `cx` fall within `[bx, ax]` and subtracting this count from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Handling Type 1 and Type 2 Constraints**: The program correctly identifies the range `[bx, ax]` where `k` must lie by using the maximum of type 1 constraints and the minimum of type 2 constraints.
- **Handling Type 3 Constraints**: The program correctly excludes values specified in type 3 constraints from the valid range by counting them and subtracting from the total possible values.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when there are no valid `k` values (`bx >= ax`) by returning `0`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
