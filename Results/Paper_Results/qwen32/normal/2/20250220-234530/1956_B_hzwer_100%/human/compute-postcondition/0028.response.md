The code increments the value at index `x` in the list `cnt` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged except for `cnt[x]`.

Output State: **`iterations_left` is decremented by 1 from its previous value and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one element; `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the integer at index `x` is incremented by 1; `x` is the next element in the list `a`; `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1.**
