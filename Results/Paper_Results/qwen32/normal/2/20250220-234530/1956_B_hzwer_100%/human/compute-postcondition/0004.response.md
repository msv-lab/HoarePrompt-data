The code snippet initializes a list named `cnt` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` retains its original list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value returned by `input()` which is within the range [1, 10^4], `a` is a list of integers obtained from the second input line, `cnt` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0.**
