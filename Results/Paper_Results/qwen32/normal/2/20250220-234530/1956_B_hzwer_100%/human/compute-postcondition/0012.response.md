The given code snippet initializes a variable `ans` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `cnt`) are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t`: Remains unchanged as it was initially; `n`: Remains unchanged as it was initially; `a`: Remains unchanged as it was initially; `cnt`: A list of integers with `n + 1` elements where each element `cnt[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`; `ans` is 0.**
