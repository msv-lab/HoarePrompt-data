The code increments the count of the current element `x` in the list `cnt`. Since `cnt[x]` was not incremented before this line, its value is now increased by 1.

Output State: **`iterations_left` is decremented by 1 from its previous value and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one element; `cnt` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cnt[x]` has been incremented by 1; `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
