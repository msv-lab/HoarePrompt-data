To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
- Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people.
- He can swap places with any person in front of him, paying `a_j` coins to swap directly with person `j`, and `b_k` coins to each person `k` between `j` and his current position.
- The goal is to minimize the total cost of these swaps.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **func_1()**: This function handles the logic for a single test case.
2. **func_2()**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each one.

#### Key Steps in `func_1()`:
1. **Input Parsing**: It reads `n` and `m`, then reads lists `a` and `b`.
2. **Reversing Lists**: Both `a` and `b` are reversed. This step seems unnecessary and could lead to incorrect results because the problem requires operations based on the original order of the queue.
3. **Calculating Costs**:
   - It initializes `soma_b` (sum of `b` values) and `pref` (prefix sum of costs).
   - It iterates through the first `n - m` elements of the reversed lists to calculate prefix sums and conditions for swapping.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions using the prefix sums and remaining `b` values.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Reversing Lists**: Reversing the lists `a` and `b` changes their original order, which is crucial for calculating the correct costs based on the problem's requirements.
2. **Logic for Calculating Costs**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost seems flawed due to the incorrect handling of the order of elements in `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly the reversal of the lists, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
