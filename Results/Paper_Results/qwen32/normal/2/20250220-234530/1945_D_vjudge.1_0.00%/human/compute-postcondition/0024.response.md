The code snippet sets `soma_b` to 0. No other variables are modified in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `lista_A` is the reversed list of `n` integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `pref` is `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`, `soma_b` is 0.**
