Output State: **`pref` is the accumulated sum of relevant elements from `lista_A` and `soma_b` is the accumulated sum of relevant elements from `lista_B` after all iterations; `resultado` is `float('inf')`.**

Explanation: The values of `pref` and `soma_b` remain unchanged as they were before the code snippet was executed. The new variable `resultado` is assigned the value `float('inf')`.
