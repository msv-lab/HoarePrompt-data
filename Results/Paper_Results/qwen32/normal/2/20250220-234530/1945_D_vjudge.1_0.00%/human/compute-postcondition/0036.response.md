Output State: **`pref` is the accumulated sum of relevant elements from `lista_A` and `soma_b` is the accumulated sum of relevant elements from `lista_B` after all iterations including the current `lista_B[i]` plus `lista_B[i]`; `resultado` is the minimum of its previous value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[n - 1]`; `n` must be greater than `k`; `i` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `resultado` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the new calculated value `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`. All other variables (`pref`, `soma_b`, `n`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged.
