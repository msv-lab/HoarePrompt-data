The code snippet provided sets `soma_b` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `i`, or `pref`. Therefore, the only change in the state is the assignment of `soma_b`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `lista_A` is the reversed list of `n` integers read from the input, `lista_B` is the reversed list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `pref` is `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`, `soma_b` is 0.**
