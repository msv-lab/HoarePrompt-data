To determine the output of the `print(resultado)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables involved:

- `pref` is a value that remains unchanged.
- `soma_b` is the sum of the elements in `lista_B` from index `n - k` to `n - 1`.
- `resultado` is the minimum value of the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for `i` ranging from `n - k` to `n - 1`.

Given this information, we need to understand how `resultado` is computed:

1. **`pref`**: This is a constant value that does not change.
2. **`soma_b`**: This is a fixed sum of specific elements in `lista_B`.
3. **`resultado`**: This is determined by evaluating the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for each `i` in the range `[n - k, n - 1]` and selecting the minimum value among these evaluations.

Since the exact values of `pref`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `n`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `resultado`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

The `resultado` is the smallest value obtained by adding `pref` and `soma_b` to each element in `lista_A` from index `n - k` to `n - 1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(resultado)` statement will be:

Output: **resultado (where resultado is the minimum value of pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] for i from n - k to n - 1)**
