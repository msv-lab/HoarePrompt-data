To determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem, let's break down the logic and compare it with the requirements.

### Problem Breakdown

The goal is to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. Kirill can swap places with any person in front of him, paying `a_j` coins to swap with person `j` and an additional `b_k` coins for each person `k` between `j` and his current position.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: This function handles a single test case.
- `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one.

#### Function `func_1()`

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Reads `n` (number of people excluding Kirill) and `k` (maximum allowable final position).
   - Reads two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which represent the costs `a_i` and `b_i`.

2. **Reversing Lists**:
   - Both `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed. This means the last element in the original list becomes the first in the reversed list, and vice versa.

3. **Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - Initializes `soma_b` (sum of `b_i` values) and `pref` (prefix sum of costs).
   - Iterates through the first `n - k` elements of the reversed lists.
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it updates `pref` by adding `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]`, then resets `soma_b`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - Initializes `resultado` to infinity.
   - Iterates through the last `k` elements of the reversed lists.
     - Updates `resultado` with the minimum value between the current `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.
     - Adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.

4. **Output**:
   - Prints the minimum cost stored in `resultado`.

#### Function `func_2()`

- Reads the number of test cases.
- Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Reversing the Lists**:
   - Reversing the lists does not align with the problem's requirement to find the minimum cost to reach one of the first `m` positions. Instead, we should consider the original order of the queue.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - The logic for calculating the prefix sums and the minimum cost does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. Specifically, the approach does not properly account for the cumulative costs of swapping and the positions of the swaps.

### Correct Approach

A more appropriate approach would involve:
- Using a priority queue or a similar data structure to keep track of the minimum costs to reach each position.
- Iteratively calculating the minimum cost to move to each position up to `m` by considering the costs of swapping and the cumulative costs.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the program's logic and the reversal of lists, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
