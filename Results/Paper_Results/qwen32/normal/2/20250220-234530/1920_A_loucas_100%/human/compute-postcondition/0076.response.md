Given the initial state and the code snippet, here's the output state:

Initial State: `num` is 0, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 1, an empty list if `x` is 2, or an empty list otherwise, `less` is an empty list if `x` is 1, a list containing `a` if `x` is 2, or an empty list otherwise, `no` is an empty list if `x` is 1 or 2, or a list containing `a` otherwise, `iterable2` is 3.

Code Snippet:
```
big.append(a)
```

Impact: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`.

If `x` was 1, `big` initially contained `[a]`. After appending `a` again, `big` will be `[a, a]`.
If `x` was 2, `big` initially was an empty list `[]`. After appending `a`, `big` will be `[a]`.
If `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `big` initially was an empty list `[]`. After appending `a`, `big` will be `[a]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big` is `[a, a]` if `x` is 1, `[a]` if `x` is 2, or `[a]` otherwise, `less` is an empty list if `x` is 1, a list containing `a` if `x` is 2, or an empty list otherwise, `no` is an empty list if `x` is 1 or 2, or a list containing `a` otherwise, `iterable2` is 3.**
