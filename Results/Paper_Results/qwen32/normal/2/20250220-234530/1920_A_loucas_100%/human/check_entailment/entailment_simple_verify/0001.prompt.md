You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`loop`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints (`innerLoop`).
   - It then iterates through these constraints, categorizing them into three lists:
     - `big`: Contains values for constraints where `k` must be greater than or equal to some value (`a == 1`).
     - `less`: Contains values for constraints where `k` must be less than or equal to some value (`a == 2`).
     - `no`: Contains values for constraints where `k` must not be equal to some value (`a == 3`).

2. **Calculating the Range:**
   - The program calculates the potential range of valid `k` values using `min(less) - max(big) + 1`. This represents the count of integers from the smallest upper bound to the largest lower bound, inclusive.
   - If this calculated range is less than 1, it means there is no overlap between the minimum required value and the maximum allowed value, so the output should be `0`.

3. **Adjusting for Exclusions:**
   - If the initial range is valid (greater than or equal to 1), the program then iterates through the `no` list to subtract any values that fall within the calculated range. This ensures that `k` does not take on any of the excluded values.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the adjusted count of valid `k` values.

### Correctness Check:

- **Handling Constraints:**
  - The program correctly handles the three types of constraints by categorizing them appropriately.
  - It calculates the initial range based on the minimum upper bound and the maximum lower bound, which is the correct approach to find the feasible range of `k`.
  
- **Exclusion Handling:**
  - The program correctly adjusts the count by excluding any values that are explicitly forbidden by the constraints of type 3.
  
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where there is no overlap between the minimum required value and the maximum allowed value by checking if the calculated range is less than 1 and printing `0` in such cases.
  
- **Example Verification:**
  - The program correctly processes the example inputs and produces the expected outputs, verifying its logic.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
