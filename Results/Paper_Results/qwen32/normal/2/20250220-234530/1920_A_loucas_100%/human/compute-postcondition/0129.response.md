Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is 4, `loop` is greater than 4, `innerLoop` is greater than 2, `x` is `x_new`, `a` is `a_new`, `big` is `[a_new, a]` if `x_new` is 1, `[a_new, a_new]` otherwise, `less` is `[a_new, a]` if `x_new` is 2, `[a_new]` otherwise, `no` is `[a_new, a]` if `x_new` is neither 1 nor 2, `[a]` if `x_new` is either 1 or 2, `iterable2` is 2.**
