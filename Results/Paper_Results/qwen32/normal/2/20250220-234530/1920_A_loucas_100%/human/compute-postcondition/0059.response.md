The code snippet `big.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `big`. Given that `a` is the second integer from the input, the list `big` will now contain this integer.

Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `no` is an empty list, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is 1, `a` is the second integer from the input.**
