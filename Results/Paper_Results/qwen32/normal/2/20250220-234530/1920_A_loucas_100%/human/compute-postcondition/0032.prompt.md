Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, constraints are represented by distinct pairs (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, `loop` must be greater than 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, constraints are represented by distinct pairs (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, `loop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer read from input, and `a` is the second integer read from input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, constraints are represented by distinct pairs (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, `loop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer read from input, `a` is the second integer read from input, `iterable2` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `iterable2` at the end of the previous iteration. If `x` equals 1, `big` contains the value `a` appended to it. If `x` equals 2, `less` contains the value `a` appended to it. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing its previous elements plus the value of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, constraints are represented by distinct pairs (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, `loop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer read from input, `a` is the second integer read from input, `iterable2` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `iterable2` at the end of the previous iteration. If `x` equals 1, `big` contains its previous elements plus the value of `a`, `less` is unchanged, and `no` is unchanged. If `x` equals 2, `less` contains its previous elements plus the value of `a`, `big` is unchanged, and `no` is unchanged. Otherwise, `no` contains its previous elements plus the value of `a`, `big` contains the values appended to it from previous iterations where `x` was 1, and `less` contains the values appended to it from previous iterations where `x` was 2.`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
