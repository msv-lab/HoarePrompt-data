The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. None of the other variables are affected.

Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and `x` is not equal to 1 or 2, `a` is the second integer from the input**.
