Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9; there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case; all pairs (a, x) are distinct within a test case; `loop` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
    if num < 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    for i in no:
        if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
            num -= 1
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: num = min(less) - max(big) + 1 - count_in_range

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1 - countInRange`, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: min(less) - max(big) + 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
