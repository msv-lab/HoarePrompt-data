Output State: **`num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `iterable` is 4, `loop` is greater than 4, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` is a list containing at least one element, and `i` is such that `i <= min(less)` and `i >= max(big)`**

Explanation: The value of `num` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `min(less) - max(big) + 1` to `min(less) - max(big)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
