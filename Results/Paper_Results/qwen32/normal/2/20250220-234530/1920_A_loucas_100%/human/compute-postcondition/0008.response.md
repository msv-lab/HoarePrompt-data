The code reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `x` and `a` respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `loop`, `less`, `big`, `no`, and `num` remain unchanged. `innerLoop` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, constraints are represented by distinct pairs (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, `loop` must be greater than 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer read from input, `a` is the second integer read from input.**
