Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `big` and `no` are empty lists. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `big` and `less` are empty lists.**
