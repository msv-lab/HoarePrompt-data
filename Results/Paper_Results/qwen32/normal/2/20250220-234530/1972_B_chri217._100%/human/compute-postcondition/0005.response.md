The code appends a tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged except that `cases` now contains the newly added tuple.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `n` is the new positive integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is the string read from input containing only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`**.
