The code snippet reads a new line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to the variable `s`. This means that the previous value of `s` is overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the new positive integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is the new string read from input containing only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first being the original tuple and the second being `(n, s)`**
- `t` remains 1.
- `n` remains the new positive integer read from input.
- `s` is updated to the new string read from input.
- `cases` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
