You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Game Setup**: Coins in a circle, each either facing up ("U") or down ("D").
- **Game Rules**:
  - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
  - Special cases:
    - If only two coins remain, removing one leaves the other unaffected.
    - If only one coin remains, no flips occur.
    - If no facing-up coins remain, the current player loses.
- **Objective**: Determine if Alice (first player) wins if both players play optimally.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: Reads input and returns a list of test cases.
2. `func_2(case)`: Determines the winner based on the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`).

#### Key Logic in `func_2(case)`:
- Counts the number of `'U'` in the string `s`.
- Returns `'YES'` if the count is odd, `'NO'` if even.

### Verification Against Problem Description:
The core strategy here is based on the observation that the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner. This is because:
- Each move reduces the number of facing-up coins by exactly one.
- If the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always make the last move, ensuring her victory.
- Conversely, if the initial number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will make the last move, leading to his victory.

This strategy works because:
- The game ends when no facing-up coins remain.
- The parity of the number of facing-up coins changes with each move.
- The player making the last move (when the count becomes zero) wins.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider the provided example inputs and verify the outputs:
1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `UUDUD`
   - Number of `'U'`: 3 (odd)
   - Expected Output: `'YES'`
   - Program Output: `'YES'`
   
2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `UDDUD`
   - Number of `'U'`: 2 (even)
   - Expected Output: `'NO'`
   - Program Output: `'NO'`
   
3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `2`, `UU`
   - Number of `'U'`: 2 (even)
   - Expected Output: `'NO'`
   - Program Output: `'NO'`

All these test cases match the expected outcomes, indicating that the program correctly implements the strategy based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and verification against the problem description and example cases, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, which is the optimal strategy for this game. The provided test cases confirm that the program produces the expected results.
