Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the last positive integer read from input such that 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is the last string read from input containing only "U" and "D", `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple being a pair of `(n, s)` corresponding to each test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times and decrements `t` implicitly with each iteration. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last number of coins read, and `s` will hold the last string of coin orientations read. The list `cases` will contain all the test cases as tuples, where each tuple consists of the number of coins and their respective orientations for each test case.
