You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    #The program returns 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (the size of a matrix), `c` and `d` (two integers), and `l` (a list of `n^2` integers representing the elements of the matrix). It returns 'yes' if the list `l` can be rearranged to match a specific sequence generated based on the minimum value in `l` and the integers `c` and `d`; otherwise, it returns 'no'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to ensure it meets the problem description for all potential cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to construct a progressive square of size `n x n` using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d`.
- Given `n`, `c`, and `d`, we need to check if a given list of `n*n` integers can form such a progressive square.
- The program should output "YES" if the list can form the progressive square, otherwise "NO".

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - It then reads the list `l` of `n*n` integers.

2. **Constructing the Progressive Square:**
   - The program finds the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - It constructs the progressive square by calculating `a + k*c + d*h` for each cell `(k, h)` in the `n x n` matrix.
   - These values are stored in the list `li`.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - Both the constructed list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted `li` matches the sorted `l`.
   - If they match, it returns "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Potential Issues:
- The program assumes that the minimum value in the list `l` is `a_{1,1}`. This assumption might not always hold true because `a_{1,1}` could be any value, not necessarily the minimum value in the list.
- The program does not verify if the constructed list `li` contains unique values, which is necessary for it to represent a valid progressive square.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
Here, `a_{1,1}` could be 1, but the program assumes the minimum value is `a_{1,1}`. However, if `a_{1,1}` were 2, the progressive square would be:
```
2 5 8
4 7 10
6 9 12
```
which does not match the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. The program would incorrectly output "YES" because it assumes `a_{1,1}` is 1.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it makes an incorrect assumption about `a_{1,1}` being the minimum value in the list and does not ensure that the constructed list contains unique values.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.
