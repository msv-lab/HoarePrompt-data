To determine the final state of the loop after it has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables over time. The loop runs `n` times, appending new elements to the list `li` in each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initialization:**
  - `li` starts with `n` elements: `[a + k*c + d*0, a + k*c + d*1, ..., a + k*c + d*(n-1)]`.
  - `k` is incremented by 1 after the loop completes.

- **Loop Iteration:**
  - For each iteration `h` from `0` to `n-1`, the loop appends `a + k*c + d*h` to `li`.
  - After each iteration, `k` is incremented by 1.

### Final State Calculation:
- **Number of Iterations:** The loop runs `n` times.
- **Final Length of `li`:** Initially, `li` has `n` elements. After `n` iterations, `li` will have `n + n = 2*n` elements.
- **Contents of `li`:** 
  - The first `n` elements are `[a + k*c + d*0, a + k*c + d*1, ..., a + k*c + d*(n-1)]`.
  - The next `n` elements are `[a + (k+1)*c + d*0, a + (k+1)*c + d*1, ..., a + (k+1)*c + d*(n-1)]`.

### Final Output State:
- `t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- `a` remains the minimum value in `l`.
- `li` will contain `2*n` elements as described above.
- `k` is incremented by 1 after the loop completes, so `k` becomes `k + n`.

### Final Output State in Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `2*n` elements where the first `n` elements are `a + k*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and the next `n` elements are `a + (k+1)*c + d*i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is `k + n`.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all `n` iterations, the list `li` will have `2*n` elements, with the first `n` elements being the initial sequence and the next `n` elements being a new sequence with `k` incremented by 1. The variable `k` itself will be incremented by `n` after the loop completes.
