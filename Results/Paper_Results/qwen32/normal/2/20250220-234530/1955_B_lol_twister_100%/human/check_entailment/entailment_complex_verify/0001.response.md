### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to ensure it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Understanding the Progressive Square Construction**:
   - The progressive square is defined by its top-left element `a_{1,1}` (which is the smallest element in the list `l`), and two constants `c` and `d`.
   - Each element in the square can be calculated using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d`, where `i` and `j` are the row and column indices starting from 1.
   - This means that for a given `n`, `c`, and `d`, there is exactly one possible progressive square.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n*n` integers.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, c, d, l)` to determine if the list `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It finds the minimum value in the list `l` and assigns it to `a` (which corresponds to `a_{1,1}`).
   - It constructs a new list `li` by calculating each element of the progressive square using the formula `a + k*c + d*h` for `k` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
   - It sorts both `li` and the original list `l`.
   - If the sorted `li` matches the sorted `l`, it returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

4. **Validation Using Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly identifies the smallest element in the list as `a_{1,1}`.
   - The annotations also show that the program accurately constructs the progressive square using the given formula.
   - The annotations indicate that the program sorts both lists and compares them to check if they match.

5. **Comparison with Expected Behavior**:
   - The program's logic aligns with the problem description. It correctly identifies the smallest element, generates the expected progressive square, sorts both lists, and compares them.
   - The annotations provide a clear step-by-step verification of the program's behavior, which supports the correctness of the implementation.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the given list of integers can form a progressive square with the specified parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. The annotations support the original assessment and do not reveal any discrepancies.

**Final:** **True**
