### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if a given list of integers can form a specific "progressive square" matrix based on the parameters \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).

Here's how the program works:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \), and the list \( l \) of \( n^2 \) integers.
2. **Finding Minimum Value**: It identifies the smallest integer \( a \) in the list \( l \).
3. **Generating Progressive Square**: It constructs a list \( li \) of \( n^2 \) integers using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h \) for all \( k \) and \( h \) ranging from 0 to \( n-1 \).
4. **Sorting**: Both lists \( l \) and \( li \) are sorted.
5. **Comparison**: It checks if the sorted list \( l \) matches the sorted list \( li \). If they match, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Analysis:

- **Progressive Square Construction**: The construction of the list \( li \) correctly represents the progressive square based on the given rules. Each element in the matrix is uniquely determined by its position and the parameters \( a \), \( c \), and \( d \).
- **Sorting**: Sorting both lists ensures that we are comparing the same set of numbers, regardless of their original order.
- **Comparison**: If the sorted lists match, it confirms that the given list \( l \) can indeed form the progressive square with the specified parameters.

### Conclusion:

The logic implemented in the program correctly determines whether the given list of integers can form the progressive square as defined by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:

Reasoning: The program correctly constructs the progressive square based on the given parameters and compares it with the input list after sorting both. If they match, it correctly identifies that the input list can form the progressive square.
Correctness: **True**
