The only variable in the loop head is `h`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `h` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `h` is some value such that `0 ≤ h < n`. Since the loop increments `h` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `h` should be incremented by 1.

Given that `k` and `h` are both incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to reflect this in the state. However, since only the variables in the loop head (`h`) can be adjusted, we focus on `h`.

Here’s the adjusted state:

- `h` was previously `h`, now it should be `h + 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, `l`, `a`, `li`, `k`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `n+2` elements where the first `n+1` elements are `a + k * c + d * i` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, and the `(n+2)-th` element is `a + (k+1) * c + d * (h+1)`, `k` is `k + 1`, `h` is `h + 1`**
