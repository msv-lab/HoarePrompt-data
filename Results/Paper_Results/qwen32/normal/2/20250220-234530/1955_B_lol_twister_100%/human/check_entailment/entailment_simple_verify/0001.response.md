### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to ensure it correctly solves the problem.

#### Understanding the Progressive Square Construction:
- The progressive square is defined by its top-left element `a_{1,1}`, which is the smallest element in the list `l`, and two constants `c` and `d`.
- Each element in the square can be calculated using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d`, where `i` and `j` are the row and column indices starting from 1.
- This means that for a given `n`, `c`, and `d`, there is exactly one possible progressive square.

#### Program Logic:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n*n` integers.
- It then calls `func_1(n, c, d, l)` to determine if the list `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters.

#### Function `func_1`:
- It finds the minimum value in the list `l` and assigns it to `a` (which corresponds to `a_{1,1}`).
- It constructs a new list `li` by calculating each element of the progressive square using the formula `a + k*c + d*h` for `k` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
- It sorts both `li` and the original list `l`.
- If the sorted `li` matches the sorted `l`, it returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

#### Validation:
- The program correctly identifies the smallest element in the list as `a_{1,1}`.
- It accurately constructs the progressive square using the given formula.
- By sorting both lists and comparing them, it ensures that the provided list `l` contains exactly the same elements as the progressive square.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm the state of the program before and after key operations:
  - Before the function call, the variables `t`, `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l` are correctly initialized.
  - Inside `func_1`, the variable `a` is correctly set to the minimum value in `l`.
  - The list `li` is correctly populated with the values calculated using the formula `a + k*c + d*h`.
  - Both `li` and `l` are sorted and compared correctly.

#### Challenges to the Original Assessment:
- The annotations support the correctness of the program's logic.
- There are no apparent issues in the implementation that would lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the given list of integers can form a progressive square with the specified parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.
