The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state specifies that `T` must be greater than 0, but since `T` is not used in the given code snippet, its condition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the input.**
