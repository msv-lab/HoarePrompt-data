To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is defined as:

```python
for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
```

Here, `line` is the variable being iterated over. The iterable is `[*open(0)][2::2]`, which means it takes every second line starting from the third line (index 2) of the input.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `line` is `"1 2 3"`
- `elements` is `['1', '2', '3']`

We need to figure out what `line` will be at the start of the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Iterable**: The iterable is `[*open(0)][2::2]`. This means it starts from the third line (index 2) and takes every second line thereafter.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `line` was `"1 2 3"`. This implies that `"1 2 3"` was the third line (index 2) in the input.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `line` should be the next element in the iterable, which is every second line starting from index 2. Therefore, `line` should be the fifth line (index 4) in the input.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `line` should be the fifth line of the input. The state of `elements` does not affect the loop's continuation and thus remains unchanged.

State: **`line` is the fifth line of the input, `elements` is `['1', '2', '3']`**

If we assume the fifth line of the input is `"4 5 6"`, then the state would be:

State: **`line` is `"4 5 6"`, `elements` is `['1', '2', '3']`**

However, since the exact content of the fifth line is not specified, we express the state in terms of the general description:

State: **`line` is the fifth line of the input, `elements` is `['1', '2', '3']`**
