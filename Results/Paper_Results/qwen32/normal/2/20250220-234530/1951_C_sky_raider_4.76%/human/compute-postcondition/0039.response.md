To determine the output of the `print(int(c))` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the variables are defined and updated throughout the execution of the program.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: The first integer from the input, representing the number of elements in the list `l`.
- `m`: The second integer from the input, likely used in calculations involving `k` and `s`.
- `k`: Initially not explicitly defined but is reduced by the total `s` accumulated over all iterations.
- `l`: A sorted list of integers from the input.
- `s`: In the last iteration, `s` is set to `min(m, k)`.
- `c`: Updated to `k * k / 2 + Σ(l[i] * s - s * s / 2)` for all iterations.
- `i`: Set to `n`.

### Calculation of `c`:

The variable `c` is calculated iteratively, and its final value is determined by the following formula:

\[ c = \frac{k \times k}{2} + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (l[i] \times s - \frac{s \times s}{2}) \]

Where:
- `k` is a value that changes with each iteration.
- `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` from the last iteration.
- `l[i]` are the elements of the sorted list `l`.

### Iterative Process:

1. **Initialization**: Assume `k` starts with some initial value.
2. **Iteration**: For each element in `l` (from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`):
   - Calculate `s` as `min(m, k)`.
   - Update `c` using the formula above.
   - Reduce `k` by `s`.

### Final Output:

Given the iterative nature of the problem and the complexity of the formula, the exact numerical value of `c` cannot be determined without specific values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `l`. However, the expression for `c` is well-defined based on the initial state and the iterative process.

### Conclusion:

The `print(int(c))` statement will output the final integer value of `c` after all iterations are completed. Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l` are not provided, we can only describe `c` in terms of the given formula and the iterative process.

Output: **c (where c is calculated as k * k / 2 + Σ(l[i] * s - s * s / 2) for all iterations, with s being min(m, k) from the last iteration)**
