The value of `k` is decremented by `s`. The value of `s` is the smaller of `m` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` and `k` are integers read from the input, with `k` being `k - s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the smaller of `m` and `k`; `c` is `k * k / 2`.**
