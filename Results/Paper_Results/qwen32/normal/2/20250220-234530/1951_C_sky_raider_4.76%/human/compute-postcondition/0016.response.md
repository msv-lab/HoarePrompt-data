The value of `k` is decremented by `s`, where `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Since `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` will be reduced by this minimum value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` is `k - s`**.
