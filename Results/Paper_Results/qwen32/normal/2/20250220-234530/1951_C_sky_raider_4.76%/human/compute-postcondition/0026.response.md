To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `n`, as `i` is the loop variable that gets initialized within the loop.

Here's the analysis:

- The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.
- The other variables (`t`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, `c`, and `i`) are mentioned but are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be directly adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given the above points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted such that `n` is at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `k` is reduced by the total `s` accumulated over all iterations; `l` is a sorted list of integers from the input; `s` is 0; `c` is `k * k / 2`; `i` is `i + 1`**
