To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) Vasya received during the settling match the pattern described.
- The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
- The settling sequence alternates between increasing from 1 to \( k \) and decreasing back to 2.
- \( k > 1 \).

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) (Vasya's position) and \( x \) (the number Vasya received).

2. **Initial Check:**
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 because the pattern described requires \( y \) to be even for valid \( k \) values.

3. **Finding Possible \( k \) Values:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of \( q \) (which is \((y - 2) // 2\) initially) that are at least \( x - 1 \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it also considers another set of divisors of \((n - x) // 2\).
   - The results from both sets of divisors are combined, duplicates are removed, and the length of the resulting list is printed as the answer.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number \( q \) that are at least \( x - 1 \).
   - It checks both the divisor and its complement (i.e., \( q // i \)) to ensure all possible divisors are considered.

### Issues with the Provided Code:
- **Logic for Finding \( k \):**
  - The approach taken by the code seems to be based on finding divisors of certain expressions related to \( n \) and \( x \). However, the logic for determining which divisors correspond to valid \( k \) values is not clearly explained or justified.
  - The code does not explicitly check if the calculated \( k \) values satisfy the conditions of the problem (e.g., ensuring that the sequence correctly places \( x \) at position \( n \)).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, it assumes that the sum \( n + x \) being even is sufficient to determine the validity of \( k \), which may not be true in all scenarios.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code does not seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem accurately for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
