You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and q contains between 1 and 100 tuples.
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []

    #State: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. If `w` is an integer that satisfies `w == w // 1` and `w >= x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the single element `w`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.

    return M
    #The program returns M, which contains all valid divisors of q that satisfy the conditions i >= x - 1 and q // i >= x - 1 for each tuple (n, x) in q.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `q` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. It returns a list `M` containing all valid divisors of `n` from each tuple `(n, x)` in `q` that satisfy the conditions `i >= x - 1` and `n // i >= x - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to be incomplete and does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used but not defined within the provided code snippet, which makes it impossible to verify its correctness. Additionally, the logic for determining the valid values of `k` appears to be flawed or incomplete based on the problem description.

Let's analyze the logic needed to solve the problem:

1. The sequence of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
2. For a given position `n` and number `x`, we need to find all possible values of `k` such that the number at position `n` is `x`.
3. The sequence alternates between increasing from 1 to `k` and decreasing from `k-1` to 2.

To correctly implement this, we need to check the following conditions for each possible `k`:
- Calculate the cycle length `cycle_length = 2 * k - 2`.
- Determine the position within the cycle: `position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length`.
- Check if the number at `position_in_cycle` is `x`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_valid_ks(n, x):
    valid_ks = []
    for k in range(2, n + 1):  # k must be greater than 1
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length
        
        if position_in_cycle < k - 1:
            # Increasing part of the cycle
            if position_in_cycle + 1 == x:
                valid_ks.append(k)
        else:
            # Decreasing part of the cycle
            if 2 * k - 2 - position_in_cycle == x:
                valid_ks.append(k)
    return len(valid_ks)

t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    results.append(find_valid_ks(n, x))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This code correctly implements the logic to find all valid `k` values for each test case. Since the original program does not provide a complete and correct implementation, it is marked as incorrect.
