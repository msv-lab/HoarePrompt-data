### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and its annotations to ensure that it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to determine the number of possible values of `k` such that, given Vasya's position `n` in the line and the number `x` he received during the settling process, the conditions of the settling process are satisfied. The sequence of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions, starting with `1, 2, ..., k`, then decreasing back to `2`, and then starting again.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n` (Vasya's position) and `x` (number Vasya received) are read.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if `(n + x)` is odd. If it is, it immediately prints `0` because the sequence length must be even for valid `k` values.
     - **Annotation:** The annotation correctly states that `q` is a list of tuples, but this is incorrect since `q` is actually a single integer derived from `(y - 2) // 2` or `(n - x) // 2`.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` where `y = n + x`. These divisors represent potential `k` values.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, another set of potential `k` values is found using `func_1` with `(n - x) // 2`.
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined and duplicates are removed using `set`.
   - The length of the resulting set is printed as the number of valid `k` values.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and includes it in the result if it meets the criteria.
   - It also iterates through numbers from `1` to the square root of `q` to find other divisors.
     - **Annotation:** The annotation incorrectly states that `q` is a list of tuples, but `q` is a single integer. The rest of the annotation seems correct in terms of finding divisors.

#### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial Check:** The check `(n + x) % 2 != 0` is correct. If the sum is odd, there cannot be a valid repeating sequence of length `2k - 2`.

- **Finding Divisors:** The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of a number that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This is crucial for determining the possible `k` values.

- **Combining Results:** The program combines results from two sets of divisors and removes duplicates. This ensures that all valid `k` values are counted without repetition.

- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases like `n = 3` and `x = 1` correctly by ensuring that `k > 1`.

#### Annotation Issues:
- The annotations incorrectly describe `q` as a list of tuples, which is misleading. `q` should be understood as a single integer derived from `(y - 2) // 2` or `(n - x) // 2`.

#### Conclusion:
Despite the annotation issues, the program logic itself appears to be correct. The annotations do not affect the correctness of the program but could lead to confusion.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
