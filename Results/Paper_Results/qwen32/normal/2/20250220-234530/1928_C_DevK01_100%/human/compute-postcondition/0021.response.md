Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `w` is greater than 2; `i` is 2. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` for any tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, then `M` includes the value 2. Additionally, if `q // i >= x - 1` for any tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, `M` includes the result of `n // i` for that tuple. Since there is no else part, no other changes occur if the condition `q % i == 0` is not met.**

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the provided program fragment and its postconditions. The condition `q % i == 0` involves a list `q` being used with the modulus operator `%`, which is not valid in Python as lists do not support this operation directly. Assuming `q` is intended to be a single integer or some element within `q` is being checked, let's correct the interpretation.

Let's assume the intention was to check if the length of `q` modulo `i` equals 0. Here is the corrected version:

Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `w` is greater than 2; `i` is 2. If the length of `q` modulo `i` equals 0, and if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` for any tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, then `M` includes the value 2. Additionally, if the length of `q` modulo `i` equals 0, and `q // i >= x - 1` for any tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, `M` includes the result of `n // i` for that tuple. Since there is no else part, no other changes occur if the condition `len(q) % i == 0` is not met.**
