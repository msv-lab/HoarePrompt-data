You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

It returns a list `M` containing all valid divisors of `n` from each tuple `(n, x)` in `q` that satisfy the conditions `i >= x - 1` and `n // i >= x - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves determining the number of possible values of `k` such that, given Vasya's position `n` in the line and the number `x` he received during the settling process, the conditions of the settling process are satisfied.

The key points of the problem are:
- The sequence of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
- The sequence starts with `1, 2, ..., k`, then decreases back to `2`, and then starts again.
- We need to find all possible `k` values that satisfy the condition for a given `n` and `x`.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the number of valid `k` values.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n` (Vasya's position) and `x` (number Vasya received) are read.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if `(n + x)` is odd. If it is, it immediately prints `0` because the sequence length must be even for valid `k` values.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` where `y = n + x`. These divisors represent potential `k` values.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, another set of potential `k` values is found using `func_1` with `(n - x) // 2`.
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined and duplicates are removed using `set`.
   - The length of the resulting set is printed as the number of valid `k` values.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and includes it in the result if it meets the criteria.
   - It also iterates through numbers from `1` to the square root of `q` to find other divisors.

### Correctness Evaluation

Let's evaluate the correctness of the program based on the logic:

- **Initial Check:** The check for `(n + x) % 2 != 0` is correct. If the sum is odd, there cannot be a valid repeating sequence of length `2k - 2`.
  
- **Finding Divisors:** The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of a number that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This is crucial for determining the possible `k` values.

- **Combining Results:** The program combines results from two sets of divisors and removes duplicates. This ensures that all valid `k` values are counted without repetition.

- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases like `n = 3` and `x = 1` correctly by ensuring that `k > 1`.

Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
