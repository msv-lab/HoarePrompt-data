Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `w` is greater than 3; `i` is 3. If `q % i == 0` and `q // i >= x - 1`, then `M` is set to `[3, 0, 1, 1]`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.**
