Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves determining the number of possible values of `k` such that, given Vasya's position `n` in the line and the number `x` he received during the settling process, the conditions of the settling process are satisfied.

The key points of the problem are:
- The sequence of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
- The sequence starts with `1, 2, ..., k`, then decreases back to `2`, and then starts again.
- We need to find all possible `k` values that satisfy the condition for a given `n` and `x`.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the number of valid `k` values.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n` (Vasya's position) and `x` (number Vasya received) are read.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if `(n + x)` is odd. If it is, it immediately prints `0` because the sequence length must be even for valid `k` values.

3. **Finding Possible `k` Values:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` where `y = n + x`. These divisors represent potential `k` values.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, another set of potential `k` values is found using `func_1` with `(n - x) // 2`.
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined and duplicates are removed using `set`.
   - The length of the resulting set is printed as the number of valid `k` values.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and includes it in the result if it meets the criteria.
   - It also iterates through numbers from `1` to the square root of `q` to find other divisors.

### Correctness Evaluation

Let's evaluate the correctness of the program based on the logic:

- **Initial Check:** The check for `(n + x) % 2 != 0` is correct. If the sum is odd, there cannot be a valid repeating sequence of length `2k - 2`.
  
- **Finding Divisors:** The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of a number that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This is crucial for determining the possible `k` values.

- **Combining Results:** The program combines results from two sets of divisors and removes duplicates. This ensures that all valid `k` values are counted without repetition.

- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases like `n = 3` and `x = 1` correctly by ensuring that `k > 1`.

Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**
