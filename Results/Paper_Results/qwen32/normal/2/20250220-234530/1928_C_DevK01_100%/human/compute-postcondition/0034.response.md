Functionality: **The function accepts a list `q` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. It returns a list `M` containing all valid divisors of `n` from each tuple `(n, x)` in `q` that satisfy the conditions `i >= x - 1` and `n // i >= x - 1`.**
