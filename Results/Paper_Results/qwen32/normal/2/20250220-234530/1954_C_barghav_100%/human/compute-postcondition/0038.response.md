To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end='')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Variable `t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This variable indicates the number of test cases or iterations but does not directly affect the current print statement.

2. **Variables `x` and `y`**: Integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, with constraints \(1 \leq x < 10^{100}\) and \(1 \leq y < 10^{100}\). These variables are not directly used in the print statement.

3. **List `a`**: A list of digits derived from an input string `s`. Each element in `a` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b`.

4. **List `b`**: A list of characters from a new input string. This list is used to compare with `a` but does not directly affect the print statement.

5. **Variable `f`**: An integer flag that is set to 1 if any swap occurs during a loop, otherwise, it remains 0. This flag is not relevant to the current print statement.

6. **Index `i`**: The index used to access an element in the list `a`. The value of `i` is not explicitly provided in the initial state, so we assume it is defined within the context of a loop or another part of the code.

Given this information, the `print(a[i], end='')` statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`, without adding a newline character after it.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact digit that will be printed. However, we know that `a[i]` is a digit from the list `a`, which consists of digits from 1 to 9.

Thus, the output will be a single digit from the list `a` at the position `i`.

Output: **a[i] (where a[i] is the digit at index i of the list a)**
