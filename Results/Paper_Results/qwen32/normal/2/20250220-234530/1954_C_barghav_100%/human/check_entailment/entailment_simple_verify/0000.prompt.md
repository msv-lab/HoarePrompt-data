You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not always maximize the product of `x` and `y`. The current implementation only performs a single swap if the digits in `x` are less than the corresponding digits in `y`, and then it stops checking further. This approach does not guarantee the maximum product because it does not consider all possible swaps that could lead to a higher product.

Let's consider an example:

**Input:**
```
1
123
321
```

**Expected Output:**
To maximize the product, we should swap the digits to make both numbers as close to each other as possible while still being valid. One optimal solution would be:
```
321
123
```
This results in a product of `321 * 123 = 39483`.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program will output:
```
321
321
```
This is incorrect because the digits are not swapped optimally to maximize the product.

Another example:

**Input:**
```
1
199
911
```

**Expected Output:**
To maximize the product, we should swap the digits to make both numbers as close to each other as possible while still being valid. One optimal solution would be:
```
911
199
```
This results in a product of `911 * 199 = 181289`.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program will output:
```
911
911
```
This is incorrect because the digits are not swapped optimally to maximize the product.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct result and hence is incorrect.
