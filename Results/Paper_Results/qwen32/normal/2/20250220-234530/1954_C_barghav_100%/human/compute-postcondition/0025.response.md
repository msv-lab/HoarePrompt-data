Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, where 1 ≤ x < 10^100 and 1 ≤ y < 10^100; `a` is a list of digits from the input string `s` with the element at index `i` potentially swapped with the element at index `i` from `b` if `a[i] > b[i]`; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string with the element at index `i` potentially swapped with the element at index `i` from `a` if `a[i] > b[i]`; `f` is a flag (0 or 1); `i` is `i + 1`.**
