The given code snippet modifies the value of `lex` by subtracting 1 from it. The initial state specifies conditions under which `lex` is adjusted, but the provided code only includes a single operation: `lex = lex - 1`. This operation will apply regardless of the initial value of `lex` relative to the specified thresholds (28, 52, 78), as long as `lex` is greater than 1.

Here's the updated state:

- `cases` remains an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100.
- `info` remains a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with an additional `1` appended to it.
- `lex` is now `lex - 1`.
- `j` remains 1.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with an additional `1` appended to it, `lex` is `lex - 1`, and `j` is 1.**
