The code snippet modifies the `temp` variable by appending a character to it. The character appended is determined by converting the ASCII value derived from `info[i][j] + 96` to its corresponding character using the `chr()` function.

Given:
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 2
- `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists
- `temp` is initially an empty string

The value of `info[3][2]` is added to 96, and the resulting value is converted to a character. This character is then concatenated to `temp`.

Let's denote `info[3][2]` as `val`. The new value of `temp` will be `chr(val + 96)`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is `chr(info[3][2] + 96)`, `j` is 2, `i` is 3**
This means that `temp` now holds a single character determined by the value of `info[3][2]` plus 96, while all other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
