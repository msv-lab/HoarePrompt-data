To determine what will be printed by the `print(temp)` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`cases`**: An integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100.
2. **`info`**: A list containing `cases` sublists.
3. **`lex`**: Adjusted based on some rules for each test case (not directly used in the `print(temp)` statement).
4. **`temp`**: Defined as `chr(info[3][0] + 96) + chr(info[3][1] + 96) + chr(info[3][2] + 96)`.
5. **`j`**: Set to 3.
6. **`i`**: Set to 3.

### Key Focus:
The `print(temp)` statement will output the value of `temp`. According to the definition of `temp`, it is constructed from characters derived from the fourth sublist (`info[3]`) of the `info` list. Specifically, it takes the first three elements of `info[3]`, adds 96 to each, converts the result to a character using `chr()`, and concatenates these characters together.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Accessing `info[3]`**: This is the fourth sublist within the `info` list. Since the exact contents of `info` are not provided, we denote the elements of `info[3]` as `info[3][0]`, `info[3][1]`, and `info[3][2]`.
2. **Character Conversion**:
   - `chr(info[3][0] + 96)`: Converts the ASCII value of `info[3][0] + 96` to a character.
   - `chr(info[3][1] + 96)`: Converts the ASCII value of `info[3][1] + 96` to a character.
   - `chr(info[3][2] + 96)`: Converts the ASCII value of `info[3][2] + 96` to a character.
3. **Concatenation**: These three characters are concatenated to form the string `temp`.

### Example Calculation:
For illustration, let's assume `info[3]` contains `[1, 2, 3]`:
- `chr(1 + 96)` -> `chr(97)` -> `'a'`
- `chr(2 + 96)` -> `chr(98)` -> `'b'`
- `chr(3 + 96)` -> `chr(99)` -> `'c'`

Thus, `temp` would be `'abc'`.

### General Case:
Without the specific values of `info[3]`, we cannot determine the exact characters. However, we know the pattern: `temp` will be a string of three characters derived from the ASCII values of `info[3][0] + 96`, `info[3][1] + 96`, and `info[3][2] + 96`.

### Final Output:
Given the general nature of the problem and the lack of specific values for `info[3]`, the output will be a string of three characters determined by the elements of `info[3]`.

Output: **temp (where temp is the string formed by converting the ASCII values of info[3][0] + 96, info[3][1] + 96, and info[3][2] + 96 to characters)**
