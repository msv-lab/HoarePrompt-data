The code snippet `arr = []` reassigns the variable `arr` to an empty list, regardless of its previous content. The other variables (`cases`, `info`, `lex`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is updated based on the described rules, `i` is `i + 1`.**
