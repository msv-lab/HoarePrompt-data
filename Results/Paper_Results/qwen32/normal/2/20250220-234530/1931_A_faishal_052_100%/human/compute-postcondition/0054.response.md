Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr`, `arr` is [26], `lex` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `lex` is greater than or equal to 2 and `lex` is less than 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` was originally between 28 and 51 (inclusive). After executing `lex = lex - 26`, the new value of `lex` is between 2 and 25 (inclusive). All other variables remain unchanged.
