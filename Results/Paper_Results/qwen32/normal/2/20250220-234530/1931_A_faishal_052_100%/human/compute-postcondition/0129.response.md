In the given for loop, the loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `cases`. The loop will execute if `cases` is at least 1 because `range(cases)` generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) `cases`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100.
- `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists.
- `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case.

Since `cases` is already specified to be between 1 and 100, no adjustment is needed for `cases` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function and does not need to be adjusted beforehand.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute. We just need to ensure that `cases` is within the specified range.

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case**. 

No further adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.
