To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given information:

- The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 2 (inclusive), meaning it runs 3 times.
- In each iteration, `temp` is concatenated with a character derived from `info[i][j] + 96`.
- Given `i` is fixed at 4, we can deduce that `temp` will accumulate characters from `info[4][0]`, `info[4][1]`, and `info[4][2]`.

From the provided output states after the first three iterations, we see that:
- After 1 iteration, `temp` contains `chr(info[4][0] + 96)`.
- After 2 iterations, `temp` contains `chr(info[4][0] + 96)` and `chr(info[4][1] + 96)`.
- After 3 iterations, `temp` contains `chr(info[4][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[4][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[4][2] + 96)`.

Since the loop runs exactly 3 times, the final state of `temp` will be the concatenation of these three characters.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations is:
Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is a string containing the characters `chr(info[4][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[4][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[4][2] + 96)`, `j` is 2, `i` is 4.**

In simpler terms, `temp` will contain the string formed by converting the ASCII values of `info[4][0] + 96`, `info[4][1] + 96`, and `info[4][2] + 96` to characters, and `j` will be 2 after the loop completes its 3 iterations.
