The given code snippet attempts to modify the variable `lex` by subtracting 26 from it. However, `lex` is not defined in the initial state, which means the code would raise a `NameError` in a real execution environment. Since the task specifies simulating the execution without describing the runtime errors, we'll assume `lex` was intended to be part of the initial state but was omitted.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume `lex` was supposed to be included in the initial state. Given that it's not specified, we can't determine its exact value before the operation. However, we can still describe the transformation that would occur if `lex` were present.

If `lex` were initially some value, say `lex_initial`, after executing `lex = lex - 26`, the new value of `lex` would be `lex_initial - 26`.

Since `lex` is not provided, we cannot specify its exact value in the output state. However, we can still represent the transformation accurately.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing [26], `j` is 2, `lex` is `lex_initial - 26`**, where `lex_initial` is the initial value of `lex` before the operation.
