Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26, `lex` is an integer, the current value of `lex` is less than 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since the initial value of `lex` was less than 52, after subtracting 26, the new value of `lex` will be less than 26. All other variables remain unchanged.
