Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state after executing the code.

Initial State:
- `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100.
- `info` is a list containing two sublists:
  - The first sublist is the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it.
  - The second sublist is `arr` with either [1, 26] appended to it if `lex` was originally less than 28, [26, 26] appended to it if `lex` was originally greater than 78, or just `arr` with `26` appended to it if 28 <= `lex` <= 78.
- `j` is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `lex` is decreased by 1 if `lex` was originally less than 28, otherwise `lex` is decreased by 26.

Code Snippet:
```python
lex = lex - 26
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `lex` is further decreased by 26.

Output State:
- `cases` remains an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100.
- `info` remains a list containing two sublists as described in the initial state.
- `j` remains 0.
- `i` remains 2.
- `lex` is now `lex - 26`.

To make it more understandable:
- The value of `lex` is reduced by an additional 26 from its already adjusted value based on the initial conditions.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing two sublists (the first being the sorted `arr` with `lex` appended to it, and the second being `arr` with either [1, 26] appended to it if `lex` was originally less than 28, [26, 26] appended to it if `lex` was originally greater than 78, or just `arr` with `26` appended to it if 28 <= `lex` <= 78), `j` is 0, `i` is 2, and `lex` is decreased by 26 from its adjusted value.**
