The code appends another character to the `temp` string. This character is determined by converting the ASCII value `info[i][j] + 96` to its corresponding character using the `chr` function. Since `j` is initially 1, the code now updates `temp` to include the character corresponding to `info[i][1] + 96`.

Given the initial state, `temp` was already containing the character `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` where `j` was 1. After executing the line of code, `temp` will now contain the original character plus the new character derived from `info[i][1] + 96`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is a string containing the characters `chr(info[i][0] + 96)` and `chr(info[i][1] + 96)`, `j` is 1**.
