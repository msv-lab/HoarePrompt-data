The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range is determined by `cases`. For the loop to execute, `cases` must be at least 1. The current state specifies that `1 <= cases <= 100`, which already ensures that the loop can execute. The variable `i` is initialized automatically by the `range` function and does not need to be set manually before the loop starts.

However, since `info` is mentioned in the initial state and it's an empty list, it doesn't affect the execution of the loop itself but is part of the given state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `info` regarding the loop execution.

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is an empty list**
