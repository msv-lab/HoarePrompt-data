The code snippet appends a new character to the string `temp`. This character is derived from the ASCII value of `info[i][j] + 96`, where `j` is initially 2. After the operation, `temp` will include this newly appended character.

Given the initial state, `temp` is initially composed of two characters: `chr(info[i][0] + 96)` and `chr(info[i][1] + 96)`. After executing the code snippet, `temp` will now contain three characters: the original two characters followed by `chr(info[i][2] + 96)`.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is a string containing the characters `chr(info[i][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[i][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[i][2] + 96)`, `j` is 2**.
