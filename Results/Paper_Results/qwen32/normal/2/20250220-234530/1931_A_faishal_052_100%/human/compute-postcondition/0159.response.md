To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and what the final values of the relevant variables will be when the loop completes.

The given loop iterates over the range of `cases`. For each iteration `i`, it constructs a string `temp` by converting each element in the sublist `info[i]` (which contains up to three elements) to a character using `chr(element + 96)` and concatenates these characters together. This string `temp` is then printed.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

- The outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = cases - 1`.
- For each `i`, the inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = 2` (since each sublist in `info` has up to three elements).
- During each iteration of the inner loop, the character corresponding to `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` is appended to `temp`.
- After the inner loop completes, `temp` is printed, and the process repeats for the next `i`.

After all iterations, the loop will have processed all `cases` sublists in `info`, and the final state of the variables will be as follows:

- `i` will be equal to `cases` (since the loop runs until `i` reaches `cases - 1` and then increments one more time to exit the loop).
- `j` will be 2 (as it is the last value it takes in the inner loop before exiting).
- `temp` will be the string constructed from the last sublist `info[cases - 1]`.

Since `lex` is mentioned in the problem statement but not used or modified within the provided loop code, its state remains unchanged.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is a string containing the characters `chr(info[cases - 1][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[cases - 1][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[cases - 1][2] + 96)`, `j` is 2, `i` is `cases`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will have processed all test cases, and the final `temp` will be the string formed from the last test case's values, while `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases (`cases`), and `j` will be 2.
