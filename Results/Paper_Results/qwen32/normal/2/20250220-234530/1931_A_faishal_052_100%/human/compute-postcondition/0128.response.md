Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, where each sublist is a sorted list with up to three elements representing the final values of `arr` after processing each test case, and `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `info` will contain a number of sublists equal to the initial value of `cases`. Each sublist corresponds to the processed result of one test case, with the values in the sublist being sorted according to the logic within the loop. The variable `lex` is modified during each iteration based on the input value for that test case, but its final value is not stored; instead, the resulting `arr` is what gets added to `info`.
