The given code snippet modifies the value of the variable `lex`. Specifically, it subtracts 26 from `lex`.

Given the initial state:
- `cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100.
- `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with `26` appended to it.
- `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value: `lex - 1` if `lex` < 28, `lex - 26` if 28 <= `lex` < 52 or 52 < `lex` <= 78, or unchanged if `lex` > 78.
- `j` is 1.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
lex = lex - 26
```

This means that regardless of the initial conditions for `lex` (as long as they fall within the ranges specified), the new value of `lex` will be its old value minus 26.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with `26` appended to it, `lex` is `lex - 26`, and `j` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `cases` remains an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `info` remains a list containing one sublist which is `arr` with `26` appended to it, `lex` is reduced by 26, and `j` remains 1.
