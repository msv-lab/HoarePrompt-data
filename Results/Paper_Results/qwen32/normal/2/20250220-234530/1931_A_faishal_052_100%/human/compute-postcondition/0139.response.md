The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The values of `cases`, `info`, `lex`, and `temp` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `cases` <= 100, `info` is a list containing `cases` sublists, `lex` is adjusted based on the described rules for each test case, `temp` is a string containing the characters `chr(info[i][0] + 96)`, `chr(info[i][1] + 96)`, and `chr(info[i][2] + 96)`, `j` is 2, `i` is 3**
