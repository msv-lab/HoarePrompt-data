Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78).
- Each letter in the word corresponds to its position in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' = 1, 'b' = 2, ..., 'z' = 26).
- The goal is to construct the smallest possible word (lexicographically) that sums up to `n`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Constructing the Word:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the values corresponding to the letters.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice to fill the first two positions of `arr`:
     - If `lex` (which is initially `n`) is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 28 and 51, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it again appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted to ensure the smallest possible values come first.
   - The sorted list `arr` is added to the `info` list.

3. **Generating Output:**
   - For each test case stored in `info`, the program constructs a string `temp` by converting each number in `arr` to its corresponding letter using `chr(value + 96)`.
   - The constructed string is printed.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for constructing the word is flawed. Specifically, the conditions inside the loop do not correctly handle all possible values of `lex`.
- The sorting step after filling `arr` does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word because it doesn't consider the constraints of the problem properly.
- The program does not handle cases where the sum of the first two letters is already close to `n` correctly.

### Example Analysis:
Let's take the first test case with `n = 24`:
- The program might incorrectly append 1 and 1 to `arr` and then 22, resulting in `[1, 1, 22]`.
- Sorting this results in `[1, 1, 22]`, which corresponds to "aab", not "aav".

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly generate the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n`.

**Correctness: False**
