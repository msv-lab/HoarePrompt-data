Output State: **`t` is `abs(m - y2)`, `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b], `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` plus `a`, `y1` is `m`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is `m - y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. Additionally, `y1` is greater than `y2`.**

Explanation: The value of `y1` is updated to be equal to `m`. Consequently, `t` is recalculated as `abs(m - y2)` since `t` depends on the difference between `y2` and `y1`. All other variables retain their original values and constraints.
