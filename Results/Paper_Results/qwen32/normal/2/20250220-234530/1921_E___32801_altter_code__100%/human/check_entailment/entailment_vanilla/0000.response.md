Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Key Points of the Game Rules:
1. **Alice's Moves**: Down, Down-Right, Down-Left.
2. **Bob's Moves**: Up, Up-Right, Up-Left.
3. **Winning Condition**: A player wins if they move their chip to the same cell as the opponent's chip.
4. **Draw Condition**: If a player cannot make a move, the game ends in a draw.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:

#### Function `func_1()`:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Reads the dimensions of the board (`n`, `m`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`).

2. **Immediate Draw Check**:
   - If `x2 <= x1`, the code immediately prints "draw". This is incorrect because it doesn't consider the possibility of Alice moving diagonally to reach Bob's position in subsequent moves.

3. **Odd Distance Check**:
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0` (i.e., the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is odd):
     - If `y1 == y2`, Alice wins because she can directly move down to Bob's position.
     - Otherwise, Alice makes a diagonal move towards Bob's position.
     - After the move, if `y1 == y2`, Alice wins.
     - The code then calculates the remaining distance and checks if Alice can force a win by reaching a position where Bob cannot counter her moves effectively.
     - The logic here seems overly complex and may not correctly account for all scenarios.

4. **Even Distance Check**:
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0` (i.e., the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is even):
     - If `y1 == y2`, Bob wins because Alice cannot force a win.
     - The code then calculates the remaining distance and checks if Bob can force a win by reaching a position where Alice cannot counter his moves effectively.
     - Again, the logic here seems overly complex and may not correctly account for all scenarios.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Immediate Draw Check**: The condition `if x2 <= x1` is too simplistic and doesn't consider the possibility of Alice winning through diagonal moves.
2. **Complex and Error-Prone Logic**: The logic for determining the winner when the vertical distance is odd or even is overly complex and may not cover all edge cases correctly.
3. **Lack of Comprehensive Testing**: The provided code lacks comprehensive testing for various edge cases, such as when Alice or Bob is on the edge of the board or when the chips are initially close to each other.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect immediate draw check and the overly complex logic for determining the winner, the provided program is not correct for all scenarios.

**Correctness: False**
