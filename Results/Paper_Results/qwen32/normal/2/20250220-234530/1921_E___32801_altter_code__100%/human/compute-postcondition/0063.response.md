The code snippet `x2 -= a` modifies the value of `x2`. Given the initial state, `x2` is initially set to the fifth element of the list `r`. After executing the code, `x2` is reduced by the value of `a`.

To determine the new value of `x2`, we need to consider the value of `a`. According to the initial state, `a` is defined as:
- `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1`
- `m - y1` if `y2 < y1`

Since `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` will take one of these two values based on the comparison between `y2` and `y1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b], `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` plus `a`, `y1` is the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, otherwise `a` is `m - y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`.**
