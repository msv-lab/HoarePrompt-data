The given code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. This line of input is expected to contain multiple integers, but the exact number and their meanings are not specified in the initial state description. However, based on the context, it's likely that this line corresponds to one set of the six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) mentioned for each test case.

Given that `t` is the number of test cases and each test case consists of six integers, the input line read by `map(int, input().split())` should correspond to these six integers for one of the test cases.

Since the code only reads one line of input and assigns it to the variable `r`, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b] for one of the test cases; Each of the next t-1 lines contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
