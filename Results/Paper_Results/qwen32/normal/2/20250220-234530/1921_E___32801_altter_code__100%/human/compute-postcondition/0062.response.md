The value of `x1` is incremented by `a`. Given that `a` is defined as `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, otherwise `a` is `m - y1`, the new value of `x1` will be `x1 + a`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b], `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` plus `a`, `y1` is the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, otherwise `a` is `m - y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`.**
