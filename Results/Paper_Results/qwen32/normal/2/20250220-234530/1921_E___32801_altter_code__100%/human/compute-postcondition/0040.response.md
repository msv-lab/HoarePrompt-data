Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state:

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]
- `n` is the first element of `r`
- `m` is the second element of `r`
- `x1` is the third element of `r` plus 1 plus (`m - y2`)
- `y1` is the fourth element of `r` minus 1
- `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus (`m - y2`)
- `y2` is the sixth element of `r`
- `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`
- `a` is `m - y2`
- `b` is `x2 - x1`
- `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`
- `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is not greater than `n`
- `y1` is greater than `y2`

Code Snippet:
```python
y2 = m
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `y2` is updated to be equal to `m`.

New State:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `r` remains a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]
- `n` remains the first element of `r`
- `m` remains the second element of `r`
- `x1` remains the third element of `r` plus 1 plus (`m - y2`) (Note: `y2` is now `m`, so `x1` recalculates to the third element of `r` plus 1)
- `y1` remains the fourth element of `r` minus 1
- `x2` remains the fifth element of `r` minus (`m - y2`) (Note: `y2` is now `m`, so `x2` recalculates to the fifth element of `r`)
- `y2` is now equal to `m`
- `x2` is still greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`
- `y1` is not equal to `y2` (since `y1` was originally greater than `y2` and `y2` is now `m`)
- `a` is recalculated as `m - y2` which is `m - m` and thus `a` is `0`
- `b` remains `x2 - x1`
- `t` remains the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` (which recalculates to the absolute difference between `m` and `y1`)

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]; `n` is the first element of `r`; `m` is the second element of `r`; `x1` is the third element of `r` plus 1; `y1` is the fourth element of `r` minus 1; `x2` is the fifth element of `r`; `y2` is equal to `m`; `x2` is greater than `x1` and `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`; `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `a` is `0`; `b` is `x2 - x1`; `t` is the absolute difference between `m` and `y1`.**
