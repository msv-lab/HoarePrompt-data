Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]; `n` is the first element of `r`; `m` is the second element of `r`; `x1` is `r[2] + 1` if `y2 > y1`, otherwise `r[2] + 2`; `y1` is `r[3] - 1`; `x2` is the fifth element of `r`; `y2` is `r[6]` if `y2 > y1`, otherwise `1`; `a` is `0` if `y2 > y1`, otherwise `m - y2`; `b` is `x2 - x1`; `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`; `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is not greater than `n`; `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`; `c` is `m - y1` if `y2 > y1`, otherwise `r[3] - 2`. Additionally, either `b // 2 <= a` or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c` or `(y1 < 1 or y1 > m)` or `(x1 < 1 or x1 > n)`**
