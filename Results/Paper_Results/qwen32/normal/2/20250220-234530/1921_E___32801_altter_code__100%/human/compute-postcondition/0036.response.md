The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `y2`. This change impacts the value of `y2` directly. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `r` is a list of six integers [h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b]; `n` is the first element of `r`; `m` is the second element of `r`; `y2` is 1; `a` is `y2 - 1`; `x1` is the third element of `r` plus 1 plus `a`; `y1` is the fourth element of `r` minus 1; `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a`; `b` is `x2 - x1`; `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`; `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is not greater than `n`; `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`.**
