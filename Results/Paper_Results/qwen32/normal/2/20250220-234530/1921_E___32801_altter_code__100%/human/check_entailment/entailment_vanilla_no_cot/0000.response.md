Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules and examples given. There are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Moves**: The program incorrectly simulates the moves of Alice and Bob. It doesn't properly account for the fact that players can move diagonally and vertically/horizontally.

2. **Incorrect Win Conditions**: The win condition checks are too simplistic and don't correctly reflect the game dynamics. For example, the program incorrectly assumes that if `y1 == y2` after a move, Alice or Bob wins, which is not necessarily true.

3. **Incorrect Draw Conditions**: The draw conditions are also incorrectly implemented. The program doesn't correctly handle scenarios where neither player can make a move or when the game reaches a state where no player can force a win.

4. **Inconsistent Logic for Odd and Even Differences**: The logic for handling odd and even differences between `x1` and `x2` is inconsistent and does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for both players.

5. **Lack of General Strategy Simulation**: The program does not simulate the optimal strategy for both players, which involves considering the shortest path to the opponent's position while avoiding boundaries.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using game theory concepts like Grundy numbers or simulating the game with a more detailed analysis of possible moves and counter-moves. The current implementation does not provide the correct results for all test cases, especially those involving complex interactions between the players' positions and the board boundaries.
