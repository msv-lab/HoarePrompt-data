The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('draw')
```

This statement will output the string `'draw'` regardless of the values of any other variables or the initial state described. The initial state provides context about the variables `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
