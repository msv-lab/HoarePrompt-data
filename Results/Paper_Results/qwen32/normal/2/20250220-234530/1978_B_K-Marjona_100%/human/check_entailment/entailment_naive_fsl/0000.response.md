Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
Bob has `n` buns to sell. He can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins for the `i-th` bun, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` coins each. We need to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by choosing the optimal `k`.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the maximum profit using the following logic:
- If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
- Otherwise, it calculates the optimal `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. It then computes the total profit by summing up the prices of the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

### Key Points to Verify
1. **Handling of `b <= a`:** If the modified price is not beneficial (`b <= a`), the program correctly returns `a * n`.
2. **Calculation of `k`:** The program sets `k = min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` or the maximum possible value of `b - a`.
3. **Profit Calculation:** The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`, which is the sum of an arithmetic series. The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

### Edge Cases to Consider
- **Small Values:** Test with small values of `n`, `a`, and `b` to ensure the basic logic works.
- **Large Values:** Test with large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` to ensure the program handles large inputs efficiently.
- **Boundary Conditions:** Test cases where `b <= a`, `k = 0`, and `k = n`.
