In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the value obtained from `int(input())`, which corresponds to the variable `t` described in the state before the loop starts. The loop will execute `t` times. 

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `t` as it is the only one mentioned in the loop head. The state of `t` should be such that it is a positive integer indicating the number of iterations the loop should perform.

Given the problem statement, `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `t` is already in a valid state for the loop to execute since it ensures that there is at least one iteration (when `t` is 1) up to a maximum of \(10^4\) iterations.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `t` itself because it is already guaranteed to be within the correct range for the loop to execute. However, if we strictly follow the instruction to adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we can confirm that `t` is correctly set.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
