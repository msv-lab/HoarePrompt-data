Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

Bob wants to maximize his profit from selling `n` buns under two pricing strategies:
1. **Usual Price**: Selling all buns at `a` coins each.
2. **Promotion Price**: Selling the first `k` buns at decreasing prices starting from `b` coins down to `(b - k + 1)` coins, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the total revenue.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution calculates the optimal `k` and computes the total revenue accordingly.

#### Steps in the Code:
1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Choosing `k`**: The code sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and also does not exceed the difference between the promotion price `b` and the usual price `a`.
3. **Calculating Revenue**:
   - If `b <= a`, it means the promotion price is not beneficial, so all buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The total revenue is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the total revenue is calculated as:
     - Revenue from the first `k` buns sold at promotion prices: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`
       - This formula comes from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `(b - k + 1)`.
     - Revenue from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`: `(n - k) * a`

### Verification with Example Test Cases

Let's verify the solution with the example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n=4`, `a=4`, `b=5`
   - `k = min(4, 5-4) = 1`
   - Total revenue: `5*1 - 1*(1-1)//2 + (4-1)*4 = 5 + 12 = 17`

2. **Test Case 2**: `n=5`, `a=5`, `b=9`
   - `k = min(5, 9-5) = 4`
   - Total revenue: `9*4 - 4*(4-1)//2 + (5-4)*5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`

3. **Test Case 3**: `n=10`, `a=10`, `b=5`
   - `k = min(10, 5-10) = 0`
   - Total revenue: `10*10 = 100`

4. **Test Case 4**: `n=5`, `a=5`, `b=11`
   - `k = min(5, 11-5) = 5`
   - Total revenue: `11*5 - 5*(5-1)//2 + (5-5)*5 = 55 - 10 = 45`

5. **Test Case 5**: `n=1000000000`, `a=1000000000`, `b=1000000000`
   - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000-1000000000) = 0`
   - Total revenue: `1000000000*1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`

6. **Test Case 6**: `n=1000000000`, `a=1000000000`, `b=1`
   - `k = min(1000000000, 1-1000000000) = 0`
   - Total revenue: `1000000000*1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`

7. **Test Case 7**: `n=1000`, `a=1`, `b=1000`
   - `k = min(1000, 1000-1) = 999`
   - Total revenue: `1000*999 - 999*(999-1)//2 + (1000-999)*1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500`

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit for each test case. It handles all edge cases, including when the promotion price is not beneficial (`b <= a`).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
