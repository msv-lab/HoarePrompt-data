### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Recap
Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1` and the remaining `n-k` buns at a fixed price `a`. We need to determine the optimal `k` to maximize the profit.

#### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the maximum profit using the following logic:
1. **If `b <= a`:** The modified price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is simply `a * n`.
2. **Otherwise:** It calculates the optimal `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` or the maximum possible value of `b - a`. The profit is calculated as:
   - Profit from the first `k` buns: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2` (sum of the arithmetic series).
   - Profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns: `(n - k) * a`.

#### Function Summary Verification
The function summary accurately describes the logic implemented in the program:
- It handles the case where `b <= a` by returning `a * n`.
- It calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)` and computes the profit using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining buns.

#### Testing the Program
Let's verify the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.
