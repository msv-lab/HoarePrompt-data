### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided code and verify whether it correctly computes the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling his buns under the given promotion rules.

#### Key Points:
1. **Promotion Rules:**
   - Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (where \( 0 \leq k \leq \min(n, b) \)).
   - He sells the first \( k \) buns at a decreasing price starting from \( b \) down to \( b-k+1 \).
   - The remaining \( n-k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the maximum profit Bob can achieve by choosing the optimal \( k \).

3. **Approach in the Code:**
   - For each test case, the code reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It calculates \( k \) as \( \min(n, b-a) \). This is because:
     - If \( b \leq a \), setting \( k > 0 \) would not increase profit since the modified price would be less than or equal to the usual price.
     - If \( b > a \), the maximum possible \( k \) is constrained by either the number of buns \( n \) or the difference \( b-a \) (since the price cannot drop below 1).
   - If \( b \leq a \), the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - Otherwise, the profit is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = b \cdot k - \frac{k \cdot (k-1)}{2} + (n-k) \cdot a
     \]
     This formula accounts for:
     - The sum of the first \( k \) terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \) down to \( b-k+1 \).
     - The profit from selling the remaining \( n-k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).

4. **Verification with Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:** \( n=4 \), \( a=4 \), \( b=5 \)
     - Since \( b > a \), calculate \( k = \min(4, 5-4) = 1 \).
     - Profit = \( 5 \cdot 1 - \frac{1 \cdot (1-1)}{2} + (4-1) \cdot 4 = 5 + 12 = 17 \).
   - **Test Case 2:** \( n=5 \), \( a=5 \), \( b=9 \)
     - Calculate \( k = \min(5, 9-5) = 5 \).
     - Profit = \( 9 \cdot 5 - \frac{5 \cdot (5-1)}{2} + (5-5) \cdot 5 = 45 - 10 = 35 \).
   - **Test Case 3:** \( n=10 \), \( a=10 \), \( b=5 \)
     - Since \( b \leq a \), profit = \( 10 \cdot 10 = 100 \).
   - **Test Case 4:** \( n=5 \), \( a=5 \), \( b=11 \)
     - Calculate \( k = \min(5, 11-5) = 5 \).
     - Profit = \( 11 \cdot 5 - \frac{5 \cdot (5-1)}{2} + (5-5) \cdot 5 = 55 - 10 = 45 \).
   - **Test Case 5:** \( n=10^9 \), \( a=10^9 \), \( b=10^9 \)
     - Since \( b = a \), profit = \( 10^9 \cdot 10^9 = 10^{18} \).
   - **Test Case 6:** \( n=10^9 \), \( a=10^9 \), \( b=1 \)
     - Since \( b \leq a \), profit = \( 10^9 \cdot 10^9 = 10^{18} \).
   - **Test Case 7:** \( n=1000 \), \( a=1 \), \( b=1000 \)
     - Calculate \( k = \min(1000, 1000-1) = 999 \).
     - Profit = \( 1000 \cdot 999 - \frac{999 \cdot (999-1)}{2} + (1000-999) \cdot 1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500 \).

All test cases match the expected outputs, indicating that the logic implemented in the code is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly computes the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling his buns under the given promotion rules.

**Correctness: True**
