To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the expression step-by-step using the initial state provided:

The expression inside the `print` statement is:
\[ b \cdot k - k \cdot \left(\frac{k - 1}{2}\right) + (n - k) \cdot a \]

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Identify Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable does not directly affect the print statement.
   - `n`, `a`, and `b`: Integers read from the input.
   - `k`: The minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   - \( b \cdot k \): This term multiplies `b` by `k`.
   - \( k \cdot \left(\frac{k - 1}{2}\right) \): This term calculates the sum of the first `k-1` integers, which is a common formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. It represents the sum of the first `k-1` natural numbers.
   - \( (n - k) \cdot a \): This term multiplies the difference between `n` and `k` by `a`.

3. **Putting it Together:**
   - The expression \( b \cdot k - k \cdot \left(\frac{k - 1}{2}\right) \) can be interpreted as calculating a weighted sum involving `b` and adjusting it by the sum of the first `k-1` integers.
   - The term \( (n - k) \cdot a \) adjusts the result by adding `a` multiplied by the remaining count after accounting for `k`.

### Final Output Description:

The `print` statement will output the result of the expression \( b \cdot k - k \cdot \left(\frac{k - 1}{2}\right) + (n - k) \cdot a \).

Given the initial state, the precise output can be described as follows:
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
- The expression calculates a specific combination of `b`, `k`, `a`, and `n` based on the conditions provided.

Output: **\( b \cdot k - k \cdot \left(\frac{k - 1}{2}\right) + (n - k) \cdot a \) (where \( k = \min(n, b - a) \))**
