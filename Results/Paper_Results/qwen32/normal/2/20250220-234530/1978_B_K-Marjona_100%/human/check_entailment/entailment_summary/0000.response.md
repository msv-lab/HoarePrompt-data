### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and verify if it correctly computes the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Usual Price vs. Promotion Price**:
   - Usual price per bun: `a` coins.
   - Promotion price for the first `i` buns: `(b - i + 1)` coins.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the promotional price to maximize profit.
   - Profit calculation:
     - For the first `k` buns: Sum of prices `(b - i + 1)` for `i` from `1` to `k`.
     - For the remaining `(n - k)` buns: Each sold at `a` coins.

3. **Constraints**:
   - `0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)`.
   - `1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9`.

#### Analysis of the Program:
- **Case 1: `b ≤ a`**
  - If the promotional price is not greater than the usual price, it makes no sense to use the promotion.
  - Therefore, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
  - The profit is simply `a * n`.

- **Case 2: `b > a`**
  - We need to find the optimal `k` such that the sum of promotional prices plus the usual prices for the remaining buns is maximized.
  - The sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence `(b - i + 1)` for `i` from `1` to `k` is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `b*k - k*(k-1)/2`.
  - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the profit.
  - The program calculates this total profit as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

- **Optimal `k` Selection**:
  - The program sets `k = min(n, b - a)`.
  - This ensures that we do not attempt to sell more buns at the promotional price than available (`n`) or than the number of distinct prices we can offer (`b - a`).

#### Verification Against Example Test Cases:
1. **Test Case 1**: `n=4, a=4, b=5`
   - Since `b > a`, calculate `k = min(4, 5-4) = 1`.
   - Profit: `5*1 - 1*(1-1)//2 + (4-1)*4 = 5 + 12 = 17`.

2. **Test Case 2**: `n=5, a=5, b=9`
   - Since `b > a`, calculate `k = min(5, 9-5) = 5`.
   - Profit: `9*5 - 5*(5-1)//2 + (5-5)*5 = 45 - 10 = 35`.

3. **Test Case 3**: `n=10, a=10, b=5`
   - Since `b ≤ a`, profit: `10*10 = 100`.

4. **Test Case 4**: `n=5, a=5, b=11`
   - Since `b > a`, calculate `k = min(5, 11-5) = 5`.
   - Profit: `11*5 - 5*(5-1)//2 + (5-5)*5 = 55 - 10 = 45`.

5. **Test Case 5**: `n=10^9, a=10^9, b=10^9`
   - Since `b = a`, profit: `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`.

6. **Test Case 6**: `n=10^9, a=10^9, b=1`
   - Since `b < a`, profit: `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`.

7. **Test Case 7**: `n=1000, a=1, b=1000`
   - Since `b > a`, calculate `k = min(1000, 1000-1) = 999`.
   - Profit: `1000*999 - 999*(999-1)//2 + (1000-999)*1 = 999000 - 498501 + 1 = 500500`.

All test cases match the expected outputs, confirming the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
