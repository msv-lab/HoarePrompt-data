### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotations and the provided problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
Bob has `n` buns to sell. He can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins for the `i-th` bun, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` coins each. We need to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by choosing the optimal `k`.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the maximum profit using the following logic:
1. If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
2. Otherwise, it calculates the optimal `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. It then computes the total profit by summing up the prices of the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

#### Annotations:
- **State before function call:** `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9\).
- **Inside the loop:**
  - `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())`: Reads the values for `n`, `a`, and `b`.
  - `k = min(n, b - a)`: Determines the optimal `k`.
  - `if b <= a:`: Checks if the modified price is not beneficial.
    - `print(a * n)`: Sells all buns at the usual price.
  - `else:`: Calculates the profit when `b > a`.
    - `print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)`: Computes the profit from the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price.

#### Verification:
1. **Handling of `b <= a`:**
   - When `b <= a`, the program correctly returns `a * n` because selling all buns at the usual price is more profitable.
   
2. **Calculation of `k`:**
   - The program sets `k = min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` or the maximum possible value of `b - a`.
   
3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`, which is the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

#### Testing:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.
