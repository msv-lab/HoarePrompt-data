The code snippet contains only a `break` statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. However, this does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `num`, `tot`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{int(num)} \leq 10^9\), `tot` is 2, `i` is `k - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
