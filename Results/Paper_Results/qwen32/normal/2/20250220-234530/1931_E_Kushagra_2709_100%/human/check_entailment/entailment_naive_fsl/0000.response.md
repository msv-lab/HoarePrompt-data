Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Reversing Digits**: The function `func_1` does not actually reverse any digits of the numbers in the list. It only calculates the total length of the numbers and the number of trailing zeros, which is not sufficient to determine the outcome of the game.

2. **Concatenation Strategy**: The function does not account for the strategy of concatenating numbers in the optimal way to maximize the final number. Sasha can concatenate numbers in any order, but the current implementation does not consider this aspect.

3. **Winning Condition**: The condition `tot >= m + 1` is not correct. The problem requires checking if the final number is at least \(10^m\), not just checking the total length minus trailing zeros.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game considering the optimal moves for both players. Here is a brief outline of how the correct solution might look:

- **Anna's Move**: Reverse the digits of a number to potentially increase its value.
- **Sasha's Move**: Concatenate two numbers to form a larger number.
- **Game End Condition**: Check if the final number is at least \(10^m\).

Given the complexity of simulating the optimal moves, a more detailed approach is needed, which involves strategic decision-making at each step. The provided code does not implement this logic, making it incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
