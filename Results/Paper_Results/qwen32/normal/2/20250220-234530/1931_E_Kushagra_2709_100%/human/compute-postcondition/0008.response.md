Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{int(num)} \leq 10^9\), `tot` is 1, `i` is `k - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `num`, `tot`, and `i` remain unchanged. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
