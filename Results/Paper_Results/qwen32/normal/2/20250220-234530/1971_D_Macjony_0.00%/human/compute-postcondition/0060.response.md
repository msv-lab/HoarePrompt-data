Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a newly input string with length at least `j + 1`; `count` is either 2 or 3, and if `s[j]` != `s[j + 1]`, then `count` becomes 4; `flag` is True if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False; `j` is less than `len(s) - 1`, and if `s[j]` != `s[j + 1]`, then `j` is incremented by 1; `i` is `len(s)`.**
