Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the input string with length greater than 4; `j` is either 2 or 4 if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `j` remains 2; `count` is incremented by 1 if `s[j] != s[j + 1]`; `flag` is True if `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'`, otherwise `flag` remains unchanged.**
