Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is a newly input string with length at least `j + 1`; `count` is either 3 or 4; `flag` is True; `j` is less than `len(s) - 1`; `i` is `len(s)`; `j` is `j + 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
