Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `s` is the input string with length greater than 1; if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is 2 and `flag` is True if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False, and `j` is 1 if `flag` is True, otherwise `j` remains 0; if `s[j]` is equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` remains 1, `flag` remains False, and `j` remains 0.**
