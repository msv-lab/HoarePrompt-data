To determine the new value of `t`, we need to evaluate the expression `t = t + t2 // 15`. Given the initial state, `t2` is defined as `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`. Let's substitute `t2` into the equation:

`t = t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`

Simplifying inside the parentheses:

`t = t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`

This means the new value of `t` depends on the current values of `a`, `b`, and `t`.

Output State: **`t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`; `a` is the first integer from the input; `b` is the second integer from the input; `n` is greater than 0; for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99; `i` is `i + 1`; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`**.

In natural language, the value of `t` is updated by adding the integer division of `(a - t * 15 + b * 4)` by 15 to its current value. All other variables retain their initial values or definitions.
