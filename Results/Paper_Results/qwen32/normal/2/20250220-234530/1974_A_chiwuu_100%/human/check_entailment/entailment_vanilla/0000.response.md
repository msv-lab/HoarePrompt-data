Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Screens Needed for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b`, representing the number of 2x2 icons.
   - It calculates how many full 2x2 icons can fit into one screen. Since each screen is 5x3, it can hold at most 2 full 2x2 icons (as shown in the example images). However, the code simply divides `b` by 2 and rounds up to account for any remaining 2x2 icons that don't fill a complete pair.
     ```python
     if t % 2 == 0:
         t = t // 2
     else:
         t = t // 2 + 1
     ```
   - This logic is incorrect because it doesn't consider the actual placement of 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid. It assumes that every two 2x2 icons can fit on one screen, which isn't always true. For example, placing 3 2x2 icons requires 2 screens, not 1.5 screens.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The variable `t1` calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. It uses the formula `t * 15 - b * 4`, where `t * 15` is the total capacity of `t` screens (each screen has 15 cells), and `b * 4` is the space occupied by `b` 2x2 icons.
     ```python
     t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
     ```
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (the number of 1x1 icons), it means the current number of screens `t` is sufficient.
     ```python
     if t1 >= a:
         t = t
     ```
   - Otherwise, it calculates how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     ```python
     else:
         t2 = a - t1
         if t2 % 15 == 0:
             t = t + t2 // 15
         else:
             t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
     ```

### Issues Identified:
- The primary issue is the incorrect calculation of the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons. The assumption that every two 2x2 icons can fit on one screen is flawed.
- The logic for calculating the remaining space and additional screens for 1x1 icons is based on the incorrect initial calculation of `t`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
