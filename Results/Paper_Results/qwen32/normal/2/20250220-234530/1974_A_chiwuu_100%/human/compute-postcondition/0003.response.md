The variable `a` is converted from a string to an integer. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `b`, and the conditions on these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is an integer representing the first integer from the input; `b` is a string representing the second integer from the input.**
