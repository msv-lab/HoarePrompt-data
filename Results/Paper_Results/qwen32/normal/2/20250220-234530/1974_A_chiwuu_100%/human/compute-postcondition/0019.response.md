Output State: **`t` is an integer, and it is equal to `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, plus `t2 // 15` plus 1; `a` is an integer representing the first integer from the input; `b` is an integer representing the second integer from the input; `n` is greater than 0; for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`; `t1` is less than `a`; `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`; `t2 % 15` is not equal to 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `t` has been updated to its original value plus the integer division of `t2` by 15 plus 1. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged.
