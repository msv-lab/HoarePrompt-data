The value of `t` is updated to `t // 2 + 1`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t // 2 + 1`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `n` is greater than 0, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `i` is `i + 1`.**
