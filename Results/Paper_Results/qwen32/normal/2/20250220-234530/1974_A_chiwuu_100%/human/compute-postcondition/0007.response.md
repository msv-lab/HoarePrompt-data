The value of `t` is updated to be half of its original value using integer division (`t // 2`). Since `t` was initially equal to `b` and `t` is even, `t` will now be an integer that is half of `b`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is equal to `b // 2`; `a` is an integer representing the first integer from the input; `b` is an integer representing the second integer from the input; `n` is greater than 0; for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99.**
