The code snippet `b = int(b)` converts the variable `b`, which was previously described as "the second integer from the input," into an integer explicitly. Since `b` is already stated to be an integer from the input, this conversion does not change its value but ensures its type is explicitly recognized as an integer.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `b` is confirmed to be an integer, which aligns with its description. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input (confirmed to be an integer), `n` is greater than 0, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99. `i` is `i + 1`.**
