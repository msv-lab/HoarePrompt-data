To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variable `t` evolves with each iteration based on the provided logic. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**: The initial value of `t` is given and is used for the first test case. For each subsequent test case, the value of `t` is determined by the previous iteration's result.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the code reads two integers `a` and `b`.
   - The value of `t` is updated based on `b`: if `b` is even, `t` becomes `b // 2`; if `b` is odd, `t` becomes `b // 2 + 1`.
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, the code calculates `t2` as `a - t1`. Depending on whether `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is adjusted accordingly:
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15`.
     - If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After `n` iterations, the final value of `t` will be the result of the last iteration.
   - The variables `a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `t1`, and `t2` will reflect their values at the end of the last iteration.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for `t`, `a`, `b`, and `n`, we can only describe the final state in terms of the logic applied in the last iteration.

**Output State: **The final value of `t` after `n` iterations, where `t` is updated according to the rules specified in the loop for each pair of `a` and `b` read from the input.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is the value of `t` after processing all `n` pairs of integers `(a, b)` as described by the loop logic.
