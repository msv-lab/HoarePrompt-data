The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (which we don't know exactly but it's the value that just finished executing), and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration to occur, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same.

So, if `i` was 0 in the first iteration, after the first iteration, `i` would be 1, and so on. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`t` is an integer, `a` is an integer representing the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer representing the second integer from the input, `n` is greater than 0, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99. `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then no change is made to `t`. Otherwise, if `t2` (calculated as `a - t1`) is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`. If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `b // 2` if `b` is even, or `(b // 2) + 1` if `b` is odd, plus `t2 // 15` plus 1. `i` is incremented by 1**

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.
