You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates and prints a value `t` based on the given conditions for each pair of `a` and `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Screens Needed for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b`, representing the number of 2x2 icons.
   - It calculates how many full 2x2 icons can fit into one screen. Since each screen is 5x3, it can hold at most 2 full 2x2 icons (as shown in the example images). However, the code simply divides `b` by 2 and rounds up to account for any remaining 2x2 icons that don't fill a complete pair.
     ```python
     if t % 2 == 0:
         t = t // 2
     else:
         t = t // 2 + 1
     ```
   - This logic is incorrect because it doesn't consider the actual placement of 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid. It assumes that every two 2x2 icons can fit on one screen, which isn't always true. For example, placing 3 2x2 icons requires 2 screens, not 1.5 screens.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The variable `t1` calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. It uses the formula `t * 15 - b * 4`, where `t * 15` is the total capacity of `t` screens (each screen has 15 cells), and `b * 4` is the space occupied by `b` 2x2 icons.
     ```python
     t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
     ```
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (the number of 1x1 icons), it means the current number of screens `t` is sufficient.
     ```python
     if t1 >= a:
         t = t
     ```
   - Otherwise, it calculates how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     ```python
     else:
         t2 = a - t1
         if t2 % 15 == 0:
             t = t + t2 // 15
         else:
             t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
     ```

### Issues Identified:
- The primary issue is the incorrect calculation of the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons. The assumption that every two 2x2 icons can fit on one screen is flawed.
- The logic for calculating the remaining space and additional screens for 1x1 icons is based on the incorrect initial calculation of `t`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
