Postcondition: **`t` is updated based on the condition `t2 % 15 == 0`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is incremented by `(a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is set to `a // 15 + b * 4 // 15 + 1`. `a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `t1`, and `t2` retain their respective values as described in the precondition, with `t1` recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and `t2` recalculated as `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`.**
