Postcondition: **`t` is the second integer from the input divided by 2 if `t` is even, otherwise `t` is `t // 2 + 1`. `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `n` is greater than 0, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99. `i` is `i + 1`.**
