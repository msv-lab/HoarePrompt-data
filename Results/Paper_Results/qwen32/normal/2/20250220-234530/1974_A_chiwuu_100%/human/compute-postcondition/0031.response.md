The code calculates `t1` using the formula `t * 15 - b * 4`. The values of `t` and `b` are given in the initial state, and they remain unchanged except for the introduction of `t1`.

Output State: **`t` is the second integer from the input divided by 2 if `t` is even, otherwise `t` is `t // 2 + 1`; `a` is the first integer from the input; `b` is the second integer from the input; `n` is greater than 0; for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99; `i` is `i + 1`; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
