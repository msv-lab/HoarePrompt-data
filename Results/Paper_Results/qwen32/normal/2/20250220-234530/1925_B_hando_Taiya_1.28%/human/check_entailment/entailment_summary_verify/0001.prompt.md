You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `x` and `n`, and prints the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the corresponding quotient `x // i` that is less than or equal to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
- The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.
- The GCD of the difficulties must be a divisor of `x`.

### Key Observations:
- The GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems must divide `x`.
- To maximize the GCD, we should consider the largest possible divisors of `x` that can be used to form `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`.

### Solution Approach:
- Iterate through all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
- For each divisor `i`, check if it's possible to form `n` sub-problems with difficulties that sum up to `x` using `i` as the GCD.
- If `i` divides `x`, then `x / i` is also a divisor.
- Check if `n` is less than or equal to `x / i` or `i`. This ensures that we can form `n` sub-problems with the current GCD.
- Keep track of the maximum GCD found that satisfies the conditions.

### Provided Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
- Inside `func_1()`, it reads `x` and `n`.
- It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum GCD.
- It iterates through all integers from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive).
- For each integer `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x`.
- If `i` is a divisor, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x / i` or `i`.
- If either condition is true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
- Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Correctness Verification:
- The logic correctly considers all possible divisors of `x` and checks if they can be used as the GCD for the sub-problems.
- By iterating up to the square root of `x`, it efficiently finds all divisors.
- The conditions `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` ensure that we can form `n` sub-problems with the current GCD.
- The program correctly updates and prints the maximum GCD found.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the problemset Yash can achieve. Therefore, the program is correct.
