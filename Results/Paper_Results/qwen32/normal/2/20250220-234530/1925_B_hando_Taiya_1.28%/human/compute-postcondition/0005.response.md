The code updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since the initial value of `ans` is 0, `ans` will be updated to `i` if `i` is greater than 0, which it is, given the constraints.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁸ and 1 ≤ n ≤ x; `ans` is `i`; `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`). The current value of `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`.**
