Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`. The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

### Key Observations:
1. **Divisors and GCD**: If we can split `x` into `n` parts where each part is a divisor of `x`, the GCD of these parts will be a divisor of `x`.
2. **Maximizing GCD**: To maximize the GCD, we should try to use the largest possible divisor of `x` that can be used to form `n` parts.
3. **Constraints**: We need to ensure that the number of parts `n` does not exceed the possible divisions of `x`.

### Approach:
- Iterate through all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
- For each divisor `i`, check if `n` can be formed using `i` or `x // i` as the difficulty of the sub-problems.
- Keep track of the maximum divisor that satisfies the condition.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the provided code:

```python
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. **Finding Divisors**: It iterates through all numbers from 1 to the square root of `x` to find divisors of `x`.
3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - If `n <= x // i`, it means we can use `i` as the difficulty of the sub-problems.
   - If `n <= i`, it means we can use `x // i` as the difficulty of the sub-problems.
4. **Updating Maximum GCD**: It updates the maximum GCD found so far.

### Correctness Check:
- The approach correctly identifies divisors of `x`.
- It checks both `i` and `x // i` as potential difficulties for the sub-problems.
- It ensures that the number of sub-problems `n` does not exceed the possible divisions.
- The use of `isqrt(x)` ensures efficient iteration up to the square root of `x`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset based on the given constraints and observations.

**Correctness: True**
