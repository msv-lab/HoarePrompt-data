To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it updates the variable `ans`.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1`.
- For each `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i` (`x % i == 0`).
- If `x` is divisible by `i`, it updates `ans` based on the conditions:
  - If `n <= x // i`, it sets `ans` to the maximum of its current value and `i`.
  - If `n > x // i` but `n <= i`, it sets `ans` to the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes, `ans` will hold the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the given conditions for all divisors `i` of `x` up to `isqrt(x)`.

### Natural Language Explanation:
The final output state is the largest divisor of `x` (or its corresponding quotient) that meets the condition related to `n`. Specifically, `ans` will be the largest integer `i` or `x // i` such that:
- If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`.
- If `n` is greater than `x // i` but less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.

### Conclusion:
The loop ensures that `ans` is updated to the largest possible value that satisfies the conditions for all divisors of `x` up to the integer square root of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁸ and 1 ≤ n ≤ x; `ans` is the largest value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies the conditions for all divisors `i` of `x` up to `isqrt(x)`.**
