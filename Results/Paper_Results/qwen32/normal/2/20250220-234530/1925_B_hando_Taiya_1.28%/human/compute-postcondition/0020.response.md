The code updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and the previous value of `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\); `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`; `i` is the previous `i + 1`**.
