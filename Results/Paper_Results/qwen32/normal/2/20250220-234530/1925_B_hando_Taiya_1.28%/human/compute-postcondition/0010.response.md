Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10⁸ and 1 ≤ n ≤ x; `ans` is either `i` if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `n` is updated to a value less than or equal to `i`. `x` remains divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).**
