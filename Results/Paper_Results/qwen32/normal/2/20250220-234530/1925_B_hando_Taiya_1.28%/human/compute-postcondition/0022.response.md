Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `x` and `n` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and \(1 \leq n \leq x\); `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and either `i` if `n <= x // i`, or `x // i` if `n > x // i`; `i` is the previous `i + 1`.**
