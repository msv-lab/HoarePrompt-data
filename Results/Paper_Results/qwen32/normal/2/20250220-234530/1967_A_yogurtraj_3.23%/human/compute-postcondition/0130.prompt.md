Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12. Additionally, a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^12. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    r = a[0]
    rem = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
            r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
            rem = k % (i + 1)
            y = n - 1 - i
            k = 0
            break
        else:
            k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            r = a[i + 1]
    if k != 0:
        r = a[n - 1] + k // n
        print((r - 1) * n + 1)
    else:
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `r` is either `a[n - 1] + k // n` if `k` is not equal to `0`, or `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` or `a[n-1]` if `k` is `0`. `rem` is either `k % (i + 1)` or `0`. `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or `0`. `k` is either `0` or reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: If `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, and `k`, `rem`, `y`, and `ii` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if the loop breaks during iteration `i`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `k` is `0`, and `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If the loop completes all iterations, `r` is `a[n - 1]`, `rem` is `0`, `y` is `0`, `k` is updated as `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for each iteration, and `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` and `a` remain unchanged; `k` is either 0 or has been reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n - 2`; `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n` if `k` was non-zero and the loop broke due to `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `r` is `a[n - 1]`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if the loop broke due to `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `rem` is 0; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the loop broke due to `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `y` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
