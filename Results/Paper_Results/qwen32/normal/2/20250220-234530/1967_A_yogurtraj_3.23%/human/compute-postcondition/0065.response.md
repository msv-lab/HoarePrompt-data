The given code snippet updates the value of the variable `y`. According to the code, `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `k` is either 0 or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `y` is now `n - 1 - i`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
