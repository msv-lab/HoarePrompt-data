The given code snippet assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to `r`. This means that the value of `r` is updated to the next element in the sorted list `a` after the current index `i`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`; `r` is `a[i + 1]`; `rem` is `0` if the if part was executed, otherwise it remains `0`; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the if part was executed, otherwise it is `0`; `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, `r` now holds the value of the next element in the sorted list `a` after the current index `i`. All other variables retain their previous values unless explicitly stated otherwise.
