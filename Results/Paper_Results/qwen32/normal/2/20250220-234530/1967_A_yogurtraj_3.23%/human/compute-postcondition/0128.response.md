To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
- `k` is set to 0.
- `r` is set to the last element of the list `a`, i.e., `a[n - 1]`.
- `rem` is set to 0.
- `y` is set to 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

### Analysis:
- `r` is the last element of the list `a`, which is `a[n - 1]`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
  \[
  (r - 1) \times n + 1 + 0 + 0 = (r - 1) \times n + 1
  \]

### Final Expression:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`.

### Output Description:
The code prints the result of the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1`, where `r` is the last element of the list `a` and `n` is the length of the list `a`.

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 (where r is the last element of the list `a` and n is the length of the list `a`)**
