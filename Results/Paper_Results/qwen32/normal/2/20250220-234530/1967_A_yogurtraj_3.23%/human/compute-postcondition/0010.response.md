The code snippet updates the value of `rem` by calculating the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, `y`, and the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is 0; `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**
