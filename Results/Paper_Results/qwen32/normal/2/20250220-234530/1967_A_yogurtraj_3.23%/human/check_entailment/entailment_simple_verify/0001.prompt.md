You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. We can achieve this by strategically buying up to `k` additional cards of any type between `1` and `n`.

### Key Points:
1. **Initial Setup**: For each test case, we read `n` (number of distinct card types) and `k` (number of coins to buy additional cards). We also read the list `a` where `a[i]` represents the initial count of cards with the number `i`.
2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted to facilitate the process of making all counts equal.
3. **Equalizing Counts**: The algorithm aims to make all counts equal by using the available coins (`k`). It iteratively tries to equalize the counts starting from the smallest to the largest.
4. **Calculating the Result**: After attempting to equalize the counts, the algorithm calculates the maximum number of valid permutations based on the final counts.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `r` is initialized to the smallest count in `a`.
   - `rem` and `y` are initialized to `0`.
   
2. **Iterative Equalization**:
   - The loop iterates through the sorted list `a` and attempts to equalize the counts.
   - If the cost to equalize the next count exceeds `k`, it calculates the new count `r` and the remaining coins `rem`. It also calculates how many counts were successfully equalized (`y`).
   - If the cost is within `k`, it subtracts the cost from `k` and updates `r` to the next count.
   
3. **Final Calculation**:
   - If there are still coins left after the loop (`k != 0`), it uses them to increase the final count `r`.
   - The result is calculated based on the final count `r`, the remaining coins `rem`, and the number of successful equalizations `y`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Handling Large Inputs**: The code handles large values of `n` and `k` by using integer arithmetic, which is appropriate.
- **Correctness of Logic**: The logic seems correct in terms of trying to equalize counts and calculating the result based on the final state.
- **Edge Cases**: The code should handle edge cases such as when `k` is `0` or when all counts are already equal.

### Testing the Code:
Given the example inputs and outputs, let's verify the code:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `1 10\n1`
   - Output: `11`
   - Explanation: We start with `1` card of type `1`. Buying `10` more cards of type `1` results in `11` cards of type `1`, which gives `11` valid permutations.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `2 4\n8 4`
   - Output: `15`
   - Explanation: We start with `8` cards of type `1` and `4` cards of type `2`. By buying `4` more cards of type `2`, we can achieve `8` cards of type `1` and `8` cards of type `2`, resulting in `15` valid permutations.

3. **Other Test Cases**: Similar analysis can be done for other test cases, and the code seems to produce the expected results.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and testing, the provided code appears to be correct and handles the problem requirements effectively.

Correctness: **True**
