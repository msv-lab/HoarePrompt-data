Postcondition: **If the loop breaks during iteration `i`: `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `k` is `0`, `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration. If the loop completes all iterations: `r` is `a[n - 1]`, `rem` is `0`, `y` is `0`, `k` is updated as `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for each iteration, `ii` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `ii` at the end of the previous iteration. Additionally, `k` is `0`.**
