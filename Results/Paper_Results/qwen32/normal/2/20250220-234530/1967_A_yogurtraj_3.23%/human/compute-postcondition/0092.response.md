The given code snippet initializes a variable `rem` to 0. This does not affect the values of `ii`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `r`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `rem` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`ii` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `r` is the smallest integer in the list `a`; `rem` is 0.**
