Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is incremented by 1; `r` is `a[i]`; `rem` is `0`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`; `k` is `0`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, except that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
