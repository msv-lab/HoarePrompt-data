The code snippet `v = i` assigns the value of `i` to `v`. However, the initial state does not specify what `i` is. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. Therefore, we can only state that `v` now holds the value of `i`.

Given the initial state, `n` and `k` are positive integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\) and `v` is initially equal to `n`. After the assignment, `v` is updated to the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `v` is the value of `i`.**
