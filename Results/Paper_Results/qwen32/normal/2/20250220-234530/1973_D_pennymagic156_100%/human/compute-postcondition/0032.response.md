The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. Initially, `cnt` is `k - 1`. After decrementing, `cnt` becomes `(k - 1) - 1` which simplifies to `k - 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `i` is still 1.
- `n` must still be at least 2.
- `k` must still be at least 2.
- `v` remains unchanged.
- `l` is still `func_2() + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `k` must be at least 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.
