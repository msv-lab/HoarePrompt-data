To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and the range parameters.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means the loop will iterate starting from `n` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by `1` in each iteration.

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `n` is at least `1`.
- The variable `i` is initialized to `n` and decremented by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `1`.

Given that `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()` and they satisfy \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), we know that `n` is already guaranteed to be at least `1`.

### Adjustments:
- Since `n` is already guaranteed to be at least `1`, no adjustment is needed for `n` to ensure the loop executes.
- The variable `i` does not need to be explicitly set before the loop starts because it is automatically initialized to `n` by the `range` function.
- The variable `k` is not part of the loop head and does not affect the execution of the loop directly, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- The variable `v` is given as `1` and is not part of the loop head, so it also does not need to be adjusted.

### Conclusion:
The only requirement for the loop to execute is that `n` is at least `1`, which is already satisfied by the problem constraints. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `n`, `i`, or any other variable in the loop head.

State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, which are positive integers satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `v` is 1**
