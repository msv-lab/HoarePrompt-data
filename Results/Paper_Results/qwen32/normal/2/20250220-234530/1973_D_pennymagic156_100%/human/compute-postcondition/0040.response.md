To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of calling `func_2()` without knowing its implementation details. Since the function's behavior is not specified, we cannot definitively state how it modifies the variables. However, we can assume that unless explicitly stated otherwise, the variables remain unchanged unless `func_2()` modifies them.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be at least `k`
- `k` remains unchanged
- `v` remains unchanged
- `cnt` is 0
- `l` is `n + 1`

Since `func_2()` does not modify any variables in the provided context, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least `k`, `k` remains unchanged, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`.**
