To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the components involved in the print statement:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be at least 2, but its exact value is not specified.
- `k` must be at least 2, but its exact value is not specified.
- `v` remains unchanged, but its exact value is not specified.
- `cnt` is defined as `k - 1`, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`, where `func_2()` is a function call whose return value is not specified.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

We need to evaluate the expression inside the f-string:
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`. Since the exact return value of `func_2()` is not provided, we can denote it as `func_2_value`. Therefore, `l` is `func_2_value + 1`.
- `i * v` is `1 * v`, which simplifies to `v`.

Thus, the print statement will output:
- `?` (a literal question mark),
- followed by the value of `l`, which is `func_2_value + 1`,
- followed by the value of `v`.

Since the exact values of `func_2_value` and `v` are not provided, we express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? [func_2_value + 1] [v] (where func_2_value is the return value of func_2() and v is the value of v)**
