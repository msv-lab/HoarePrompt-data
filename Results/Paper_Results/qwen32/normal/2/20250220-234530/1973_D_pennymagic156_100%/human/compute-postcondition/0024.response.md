To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while cnt and l < n + 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `cnt` is truthy (non-zero).
2. `l < n + 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be at least `k`
- `k` remains unchanged
- `v` remains unchanged
- `cnt` is `k`
- `l` is 1

Let's analyze each condition:

1. **Condition `cnt`:**
   - The current state specifies that `cnt` is `k`.
   - For `cnt` to be truthy, `k` must be non-zero.

2. **Condition `l < n + 1`:**
   - The current state specifies that `l` is 1.
   - We need `l < n + 1`, which translates to `1 < n + 1` or `0 < n`.
   - Since `n` must be at least `k`, and `k` must be non-zero for `cnt` to be truthy, `n` will naturally satisfy `0 < n` as long as `k` is non-zero.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `k` (and consequently `cnt`) is non-zero. This will satisfy both conditions for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the modified state should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least `k`, `k` must be non-zero, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1**
