To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the variables and their values based on the initial state:

- `i` is 3.
- `n` is at least 5 (but this value is not used in the print statement).
- `k` is 2 (but this value is not used in the print statement).
- `v` remains unchanged (its specific value is not provided, so we'll denote it as `v`).
- `cnt` is 2 (but this value is not used in the print statement).
- `l` is 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Let's break down the components of the formatted string:
- `?` is a literal character.
- `{l}` will be replaced with the value of `l`, which is 1.
- `{i * v}` will be replaced with the result of the expression `i * v`. Since `i` is 3 and `v` remains unchanged but its value is not specified, we denote it as `3 * v`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 3*v (where v is the unchanged value of v)**
