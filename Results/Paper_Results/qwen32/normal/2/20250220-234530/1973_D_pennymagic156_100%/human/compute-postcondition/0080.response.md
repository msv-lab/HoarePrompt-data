To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state:

Initial State:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is at least 5
- `k` is 2
- `v` remains unchanged
- `cnt` is 0
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`. Given that `l` is also described as `n + 1`, it implies `func_2()` returns `n`.

Code:
```
func_2()
```

This line of code calls `func_2()`, but it does not assign its return value to any variable. Since `func_2()` is called, and based on the initial state description, we know `func_2()` returns `n`.

However, since the return value of `func_2()` is not stored or used anywhere in the provided code snippet, none of the variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `v`, `cnt`, `l`) are explicitly modified by this function call.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except that `func_2()` has been executed.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`.**
