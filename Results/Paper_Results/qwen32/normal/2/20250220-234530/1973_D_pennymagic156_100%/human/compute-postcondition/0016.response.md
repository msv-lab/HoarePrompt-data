To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is simply `i` (it's not specified what `i` is, but it's a variable).
- `v` is the return value of `func_2()`, but this variable is not used in the print statement.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
- The string starts with `'? 1 '`.
- It then multiplies the variable `i` by `n` and inserts the result into the string.
- The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the console, but it does not affect the content being printed.

### Values:
- `i` is a variable whose value is not explicitly given in the initial state.
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

### Output:
The output will be a string starting with `'? 1 '` followed by the product of `i` and `n`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `i * n`. However, we can describe the output precisely in terms of `i` and `n`.

Output: **? 1 [i * n] (where i is a variable and n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4)**
