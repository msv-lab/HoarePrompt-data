The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. Initially, `cnt` is 1, so after the operation, `cnt` becomes 0. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `v`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` where `func_2()` returns a value less than 5**.
