To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop head: `cnt` and `l < n + 1`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 1 (not used in the loop condition)
- `n` must be at least `k` (used in the loop condition)
- `k` must be non-zero (used in defining `cnt`)
- `v` remains unchanged (not used in the loop condition)
- `cnt` is `k - 1` (used in the loop condition)
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` (used in the loop condition)

### Analysis:

1. **Condition `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is defined as `k - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `cnt` must be truthy (non-zero).
   - Since `k` must be non-zero, `k - 1` could be zero if `k` is 1. Therefore, to ensure `cnt` is non-zero, `k` must be at least 2.

2. **Condition `l < n + 1`:**
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`.
   - We need to ensure `l < n + 1`.
   - Given that `n` must be at least `k`, and `k` is at least 2, `n` must be at least 2.
   - To satisfy `l < n + 1`, `l` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `l` is `func_2() + 1`, we need `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `func_2() < n`.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to make sure:
- `k` is at least 2 (so `cnt` is non-zero).
- `n` is at least `k` (which is already satisfied if `k` is at least 2).
- `l` (which is `func_2() + 1`) is less than `n + 1`.

Since we cannot control the exact value returned by `func_2()`, we can only ensure that `n` is sufficiently large relative to `func_2()`'s output. Given that `n` must be at least `k` and `k` is at least 2, we can set `n` to be at least 2.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `k` must be at least 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**
