The code snippet assigns the return value of `func_2()` to the variable `v`. Since the initial state specifies that `v` is already the return value of `func_2()`, executing this line does not change the value of `v`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\); `i` is `i`; `v` is the return value of `func_2()`**
