To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`. These are positive integers satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `v` is set to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement uses an f-string to format the output.
- The f-string contains three parts: `?`, `1`, and `{i * n}`.
- `?` and `1` are literal strings and will be printed as they are.
- `{i * n}` is a placeholder for the expression `i * n`.

### Variables:
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `k` is also a positive integer between 1 and `n`.
- `v` is set to 1 but is not used in the print statement.
- `i` is not defined in the given initial state, so its value is unknown from the provided information.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i * n`. Therefore, the output will contain the expression `i * n` as it is.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 1 i * n (where i is an undefined variable)**
