To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the implicit bounds defined by `n` and `k`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

- The loop starts with `i = 1` and continues as long as `i < n // k + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.

Let's analyze the conditions:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so `i` should be 3.
- `n` must be such that `n // k + 1` is greater than 3 to allow the loop to continue executing.
- `k` remains unchanged, so it stays 2.
- `v` remains unchanged, so it stays whatever value it had.
- `cnt` remains unchanged, so it stays 0.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than 4, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`. Since `cnt` is 0, `l` must not be equal to `n + 1`.

Given these constraints, let's adjust the state:

- `i` should be 3.
- `n` must be such that `n // k + 1 > 3`, which means `n // 2 + 1 > 3` or `n // 2 > 2` or `n > 4`.
- `k` remains 2.
- `v` remains unchanged.
- `cnt` remains 0.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` and must be less than 4, and `l` must not be equal to `n + 1`.

Since `l` must be less than 4, possible values for `l` are 1, 2, or 3. Let's assume `l` is 3 (a valid value less than 4).

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 5, `k` is 2, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is 3**
