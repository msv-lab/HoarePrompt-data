To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be at least `k + 1`.
- `k` must be non-zero.
- `v` remains unchanged (its specific value is not provided, so it will be represented as `v`).
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is 1.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- `l` is explicitly given as 1.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `v` is not explicitly given, but it will be multiplied by `i` (which is 2). Therefore, the expression `i * v` will be `2 * v`.

Given these details, the print statement will output a formatted string with the values of `l` and `i * v`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `? 1 2*v` where `v` is the value of the variable `v`.

Output: **? 1 2*v (where v is the value of the variable v)**
