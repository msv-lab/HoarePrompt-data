The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. Given that `cnt` was initially `k`, after the operation, `cnt` becomes `k - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least `k + 1`, `k` must be non-zero, `v` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.
