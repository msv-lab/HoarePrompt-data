Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible test cases. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Path Construction**: The code attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest path but does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it only considers switching from the top row to the bottom row at the first opportunity where the bottom row has a '0' and the top row has a '1'. However, there might be other opportunities to switch that could result in a lexicographically smaller string.

2. **Counting Paths**: The logic for counting the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that the number of paths is simply the difference between the switching point and the start, which is not always true.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where the entire top row or bottom row consists of the same value (all '0's or all '1's). In such cases, the smallest string would be the concatenation of the appropriate row, and the number of paths would be different.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, involving dynamic programming or careful path tracking to ensure that the lexicographically smallest string is found and that all valid paths leading to this string are counted.
