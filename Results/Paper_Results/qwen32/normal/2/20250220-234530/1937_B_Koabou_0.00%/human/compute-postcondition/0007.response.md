The code appends an additional binary string (of length `n`) to the list `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` already contains two binary strings. After the execution of the code, `a` will contain three binary strings.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; the first line of each test case contains a binary string of length `n`; the second line of each test case contains another binary string of length `n`; the third line of each test case contains yet another binary string of length `n`; `a` is a list containing three binary strings; `_` is 0**
