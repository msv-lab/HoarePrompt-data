Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; the first line of each test case contains a binary string of length `n`; the second line of each test case contains another binary string of length `n`; `a` is a list containing two binary strings; `s` is an empty list; `x` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `x` has been set to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
