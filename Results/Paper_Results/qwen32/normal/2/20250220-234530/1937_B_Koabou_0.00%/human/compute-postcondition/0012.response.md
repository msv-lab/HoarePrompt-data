Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; the first line of each test case contains a binary string of length `n`; the second line of each test case contains another binary string of length `n`; `a` is a list containing two binary strings; `s` is an empty list; `x` is 0. Additionally, `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0'.**
