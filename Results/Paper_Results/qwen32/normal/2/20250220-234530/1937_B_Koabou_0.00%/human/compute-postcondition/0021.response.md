Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list containing two binary strings; if `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`, then `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` and `x` is the value of the incremented `i`; otherwise, `s` remains an empty list and `x` remains 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
