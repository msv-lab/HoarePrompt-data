You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and two binary strings representing the rows of the grid.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the resulting string.
   - It iterates through the columns from left to right (except the last column).
   - During iteration, it checks if the current column in the second row (`a[1][i]`) is '0' and the next column in the first row (`a[0][i + 1]`) is '1'. If such a pair is found, it constructs the string `s` by taking the part of the first row up to the current column plus the rest of the second row starting from the current column.
   - If no such pair is found, it defaults to taking the entire first row and appending the last character of the second row.
   - This approach ensures that the resulting string `s` is the lexicographically smallest possible string by prioritizing '0's as much as possible while moving right or down.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths**:
   - The variable `x` stores the index where the switch from the first row to the second row occurs.
   - The program then counts the number of ways to reach the point where the switch occurs (`x`). This is done by checking how many prefixes of the first row match the prefix of the resulting string `s` up to the switch point.
   - The count `t` is initialized to `x - i + 1` where `i` is the last index where the prefix matches.
   - However, there is a logical flaw here. The count `t` should actually be the number of ways to reach the switch point `x` from the start, which is simply `2^(number of 'down' moves before `x`)`. The current implementation does not correctly calculate this.

### Correctness Evaluation

While the program correctly identifies the lexicographically smallest string, the method used to count the number of paths yielding this string is flawed. The count `t` is not calculated correctly, leading to incorrect results for the number of paths.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in counting the number of paths.

**Correctness: False**
