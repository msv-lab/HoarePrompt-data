You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The first and second lines of each test case contain binary strings of length n, representing the rows a_{11} a_{12} \ldots a_{1n} and a_{21} a_{22} \ldots a_{2n}, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; the first line of each test case contains a binary string of length `n`; the second line of each test case contains another binary string of length `n`; `a` is a list containing two binary strings.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` and `x` is `i` if the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` is satisfied for some `i`; otherwise, `s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` and `x` is `n - 1`.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: s is `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` if `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` for some `i`; otherwise, `s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`. `x` is `i` if `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` for some `i` and `i >= 1`; otherwise, `x` is `n - 1`. `t` is `1`.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is constructed based on the conditions involving a[0] and a[1])
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two binary strings of equal length `n` (with 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5). The function processes each pair of binary strings and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
