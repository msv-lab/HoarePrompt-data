Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list containing two binary strings; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[0][i + 1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`, then `s` is set to `a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]` and `x` is set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to `s` or `x`.**
