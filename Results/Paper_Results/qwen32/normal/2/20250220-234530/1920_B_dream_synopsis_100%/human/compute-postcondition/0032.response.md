To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, let's analyze the impact on the variables involved:

Given Code:
```python
sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
```

This line modifies the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`.

### Impact Analysis:
- `sums`: This variable is updated to its current value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice `a[i + x - 1]`.
- `a`: This list remains unchanged.
- `i`: This variable remains unchanged.
- `x`: This variable remains unchanged.
- `t`, `n`, `k`, `sum1`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not referenced or modified in the given line of code.

### Output State:
The only variable that changes is `sums`. Its new value is calculated as described above.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that k ≥ 0; `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` and, depending on the condition, either the newly appended `sums` or `sums + a[0]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
