The given code modifies the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k` is an integer such that k ≥ 0, `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is an empty list; `i` is not equal to 0 and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
