The code snippet `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i - 1` from the list `a`. Given that `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, and `sums` is initially the first element of `ans`, the new value of `sums` will be the previous value of `sums` plus the element at the position `i - 1` in `a`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, the element at `a[i - 1]` is the next element in the list `a` that needs to be added to `sums`.

Therefore, the updated value of `sums` will be the sum of its previous value and the element at index `i - 1` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums` which is now `sums + a[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**
