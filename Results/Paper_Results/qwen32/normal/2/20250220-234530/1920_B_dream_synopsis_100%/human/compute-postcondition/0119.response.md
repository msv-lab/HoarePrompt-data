To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

1. **Variables and Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.
   - `x` is the third integer from the input.
   - `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`.
   - `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements where each element is the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.

2. **Understanding the Loop and `ans`**:
   - The list `ans` is constructed during a loop that runs `k + 1` times.
   - In each iteration, the value of `sums` (which is initially `sum1`) is appended to `ans`.
   - During each iteration, the largest element in the list `a` is removed and subtracted from `sums`.

3. **Determining the Maximum Value in `ans`**:
   - Since `ans` contains the cumulative sums of the list `a` after removing the largest elements in each iteration, the maximum value in `ans` will be the initial sum of all elements in `a`, which is `sum1`.
   - This is because `sums` starts as `sum1` and only decreases in subsequent iterations as elements are removed from `a`.

Given this understanding, the maximum value in `ans` will always be the initial sum of the list `a`, which is `sum1`.

Therefore, the output of `print(max(ans))` will be:

Output: **sum1 (where sum1 is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`)**
