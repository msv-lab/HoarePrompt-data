To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`. The variable `i` is used as the loop counter and ranges from `0` to `k`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is at least 0
- `x` is an integer
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`
- `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`
- If `i` is equal to 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`
- If `i` is not equal to 0, `sums` is updated based on whether `i + x - 1` is less than `n`: if true, `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` becomes `sums + a[i - 1]`

Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current Value of `i`:** Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `i = j`.
2. **Next Iteration:** For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `j + 1`.

### Adjusting the State:

- Since `i` is the only variable that needs adjustment, we increment `i` by 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, and `sums`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:

If `i` was `j` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `j + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`, `i` is `j + 1`** (where `j` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).

Since we don't know the exact value of `j`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`** (where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`, `i` is `i + 1`**
