To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `sums` variable and appends it to the `ans` list over each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs for `k + 1` iterations.
- For `i = 0`, `sums` is initialized to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- For subsequent iterations (`i > 0`), `sums` is updated based on whether `i + x - 1 < n`:
  - If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
  - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

### Final Output State:
After `k + 1` iterations, the `ans` list will contain `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` at the end of each iteration.

Let's break down the final state:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `sum1` remains unchanged.
- `ans` contains `k + 1` elements, where each element is calculated based on the logic described above.

### Final Output State Description:
The final output state is characterized by the `ans` list containing `k + 1` elements, each computed according to the loop's logic. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1` remain the same as they were at the start.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a reversed (now descending) sorted list of integers read from the input; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.**
