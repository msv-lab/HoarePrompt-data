Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` is a list containing two elements `[sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1], sums]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sums`.**
