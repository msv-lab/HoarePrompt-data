The code snippet appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified by this operation.

Given the initial state, `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Since `ans` was initially an empty list, after appending `sums`, `ans` will contain one element, which is `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` must be at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element `sums`, `i` is equal to 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
