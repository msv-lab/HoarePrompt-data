Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
