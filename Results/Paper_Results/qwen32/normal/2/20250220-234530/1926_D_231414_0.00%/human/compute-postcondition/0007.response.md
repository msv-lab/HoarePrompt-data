Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers from the input, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is `n`.**

Explanation: The value of `check` is reassigned to \(2^{31} - 1\), which is 2147483647. However, since `check` was already 2147483647 in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values.
