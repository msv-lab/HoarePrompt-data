Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `times` is greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer, `dic` is a dictionary containing `s` as a key with a value of `dic[s] - 1`, `ans` is `n - 1`, `s` is `i ^ 2147483647`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` has been decremented by 1, making it equal to `n - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
