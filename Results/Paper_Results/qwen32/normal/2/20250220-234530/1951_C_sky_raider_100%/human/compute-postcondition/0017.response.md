The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `s + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `s + 2`, and `n` must still be greater than `s + 2`.

State: **`t` is `s + s`; `n` must be greater than `s + 2`; `m` is an integer read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input minus `2 * s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k` (where `k` was originally an integer read from the input minus `s`); `c` is `c + s * (l[i] + s)`; `i` is `s + 2`.**
