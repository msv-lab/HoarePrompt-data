The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `s`, `n` must be greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `s + 1`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is `s`; `n` must be greater than `s + 1`; `m` is an integer read from the input; `k` is an integer read from the input minus `s`; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`; `c` is `c + s * l[i]`; `i` is `s + 1`**
