The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state mentions that `i` is `i + 1`, which suggests that `i` was previously incremented by 1, but this operation does not affect the current code snippet. Therefore, the only changes are the assignments to `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the three integers read from the input.**
