Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to buy `k` tickets over `n` days.
- Each day has a price `a_i` for a ticket.
- We can buy up to `m` tickets per day.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price for all subsequent days by `x`.

### Objective:
Minimize the total cost to buy exactly `k` tickets.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Sorting the Prices:**
   ```python
   l.sort()
   ```
   The program sorts the list of prices in ascending order. This is a good strategy because buying cheaper tickets first minimizes the overall cost.

2. **Iterating Over Days:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       s = min(m, k)
       c += s * (l[i] + t)
       t += s
       k -= s
   ```
   - `s = min(m, k)` ensures that we do not buy more tickets than allowed per day (`m`) or more than we need (`k`).
   - `c += s * (l[i] + t)` calculates the cost of buying `s` tickets on day `i` considering the current price increase `t`.
   - `t += s` updates the price increase for future days.
   - `k -= s` decreases the number of tickets we still need to buy.

3. **Output:**
   ```python
   print(int(c))
   ```
   After processing all days, the program prints the total cost `c`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Sorting:** Sorting the prices ensures that we buy the cheapest tickets first, which is optimal.
- **Buying Logic:** The logic of buying up to `m` tickets per day or as many as needed (`k`) is correct.
- **Price Increase:** The price increase `t` is correctly updated after each purchase.
- **Termination:** The loop terminates when all tickets are bought (`k == 0`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the strategy to minimize the cost of buying `k` tickets over `n` days with the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
