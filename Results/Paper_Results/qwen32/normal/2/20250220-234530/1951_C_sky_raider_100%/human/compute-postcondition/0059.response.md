The value of `k` is decremented by `s`. Given that `s` is `min(m, k)`, the new value of `k` will be `k - min(m, k)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input minus `S_total` minus `min(m, k)`, `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `t` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `c + min(m, k) * l[n]`, `s` is `min(m, k)`**
