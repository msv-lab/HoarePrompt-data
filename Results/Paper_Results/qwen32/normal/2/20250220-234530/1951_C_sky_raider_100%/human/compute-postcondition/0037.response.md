Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - s`, `l` remains unchanged, `s` is `min(m, k - s)`, `t` is `t + s`, `c` is `c + s * (l[0] + t)`**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated to be the minimum of `m` and `k - s`. All other variables retain their previous states or expressions unless they depend on `s`, which is now recalculated.
