The code snippet `t += s` increments the value of `t` by the value of `s`. Given the initial state, `t` was 0, and `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`.

Therefore, the new value of `t` will be `s` (since `t` was initially 0).

All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `s`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `s`; `n` must be greater than 0; `m`, `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`; `c` is `c + s * l[i]`.**
