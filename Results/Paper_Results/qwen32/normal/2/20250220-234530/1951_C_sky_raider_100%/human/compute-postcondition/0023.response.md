To determine the output of the `print(int(c))` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and how the variable `c` is computed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- **Variables and their meanings:**
  - `n`: Number of iterations.
  - `m`: Not explicitly used in the calculation of `c`, so it doesn't affect the output.
  - `l`: A list of integers.
  - `s`: A variable that changes with each iteration.
  - `k`: A variable that decreases with each iteration (`k = k_initial - n * s`).
  - `t`: A variable that increases with each iteration (`t = n * s`).
  - `c`: A cumulative sum calculated during the iterations.

### Calculation of `c`:
The variable `c` is calculated using the formula:
\[ c = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s \cdot (l[i] + i \cdot s) \]

This means `c` is the sum of terms where each term is `s` multiplied by the sum of the corresponding element in the list `l` and the product of the index `i` and `s`.

### Step-by-step Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: Before the loop starts, `c` is initialized to 0.
2. **Iteration**: For each iteration from 0 to `n-1`:
   - The term `s * (l[i] + i * s)` is calculated.
   - This term is added to `c`.

### Final Value of `c`:
After `n` iterations, `c` will hold the sum of all terms calculated in each iteration.

### Output:
The `print(int(c))` statement will print the integer value of `c`.

Given the information, the output will be the integer value of the cumulative sum `c` after `n` iterations.

### Final Answer:
Output: **c (where c is the cumulative sum calculated as sum(s * (l[i] + i * s) for i in range(n)))**
