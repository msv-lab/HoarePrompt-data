The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the characters in the string `s`. Therefore, the only state we can adjust is `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last character processed from the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character in `s` to assign to `i`.

Let's denote the current value of `i` as the `j`-th character of `s`. For the next iteration, `i` should be the `(j+1)`-th character of `s`.

Given that `s` consists of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and has a length `m`, we need to ensure that there is a next character available in `s` for `i` to take.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, `m` is the length of `s` and satisfies 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in `s` (the character following the previously processed character).**

Since the exact position of `i` in the previous iteration isn't specified, we assume it was the `j`-th character. For the next iteration, `i` should be the `(j+1)`-th character.

However, without knowing the exact position `j`, we can generalize that `i` should be the next character in the sequence of `s`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, `m` is the length of `s` and satisfies 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in `s` (the character following the previously processed character).**

If we assume the previous `i` was the `j`-th character, then the new `i` should be the `(j+1)`-th character. But since we don't have the exact `j`, we just say `i` is the next character in `s`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, `m` is the length of `s` and satisfies 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `i` is the next character in `s`.**
