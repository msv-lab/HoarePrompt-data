You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
t = int(input())
OUT = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (b, s1, s2) = func_1(s, k, n)
    if not b:
        OUT.append('No')
        i = 97
        while i <= k + 97:
            if chr(i) not in s1:
                break
            i += 1
        be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))
        OUT.append(s2 + be9i)
    else:
        OUT.append('Yes')
for i in OUT:
    print(i)

def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
    r = len(s1) // k
    return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a string `s` composed of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, checking if its length is at least `n * k`. It returns a tuple with a boolean indicating this condition, a substring of `s` starting from a specific index, and the last character of `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem description to identify any discrepancies.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string `s`.
- If not, we need to provide a specific string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

#### Code Analysis:
The code provided has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` occur as subsequences in `s`, but it does not do this correctly.
   - The function seems to be checking for the presence of all characters in `s` and then constructing a new string, but it does not ensure that all combinations of length `n` are checked.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The function `func_1` removes characters from the set `alphabet` as they appear in `s`. This approach does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present.
   - The logic for constructing the missing string (`s2 + be9i`) is flawed and does not ensure that it is the correct missing subsequence.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where `n` is larger than `m` (length of `s`), which means no string of length `n` can possibly be a subsequence.
   - The code does not correctly identify the missing subsequence when `s` does not contain all possible subsequences of length `n`.

#### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
According to the problem description, the output should be:
```
NO
aa
```
However, the provided code might not correctly identify `aa` as the missing subsequence because of its flawed logic.

#### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the code does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
