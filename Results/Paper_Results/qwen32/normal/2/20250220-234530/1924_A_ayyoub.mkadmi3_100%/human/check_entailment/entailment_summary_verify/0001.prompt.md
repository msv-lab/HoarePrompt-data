You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
t = int(input())
OUT = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (b, s1, s2) = func_1(s, k, n)
    if not b:
        OUT.append('No')
        i = 97
        while i <= k + 97:
            if chr(i) not in s1:
                break
            i += 1
        be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))
        OUT.append(s2 + be9i)
    else:
        OUT.append('Yes')
for i in OUT:
    print(i)

def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
    r = len(s1) // k
    return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a string `s` composed of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, checking if its length is at least `n * k`. It returns a tuple with a boolean indicating this condition, a substring of `s` starting from a specific index, and the last character of `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English letters occur as a subsequence in the string `s`.
- If they do not, we need to provide an example of a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

### Provided Code Analysis:

#### Main Loop:
1. The main loop reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
3. It calls `func_1(s, k, n)` which is supposed to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`.
4. Based on the result from `func_1`, it either prints "YES" or "NO" followed by a counterexample string if necessary.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. Initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings.
2. Creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English letters.
3. Iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`:
   - If `i` is in `alphabet`, it removes `i` from `alphabet` (unless `alphabet` has only one element).
   - Adds `i` to `s1`.
   - If `alphabet` becomes empty, it adds `i` to `s2` and resets `alphabet`.
4. Calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
5. Returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`.

### Issues with the Code:
1. **Logic of `func_1`**:
   - The logic of `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` can be subsequences in `s`. Instead, it seems to be trying to count occurrences of certain patterns but does not properly handle the requirement of checking all possible combinations of length `n`.
   
2. **Counterexample Generation**:
   - The counterexample generation logic is incorrect. It tries to find the first missing character in `s1` and constructs a string based on that, which does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid counterexample.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified above, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
