Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 26, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 26, `m` is the length of `s` and satisfies 1 <= `m` <= 1000, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is in `alphabet`, then `s1` is the string containing the single character `i`, `s2` is the string containing the single character `i` if the length of `alphabet` is 1, otherwise `s2` remains an empty string, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets excluding `i` if the length of `alphabet` is not 1, otherwise `alphabet` remains unchanged and includes `i`. If `i` is not in `alphabet`, `s1` and `s2` remain empty strings and `alphabet` remains unchanged.**
