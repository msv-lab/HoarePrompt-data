To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (though this doesn't directly affect the current print statement).
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `v2` is set to `n-1`.
- `r` is an input string.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (implying it has been used previously).

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Let's break down the variables in the print statement:
- `v1`: This is described as the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<'. If no such `i` exists, `v1` is 0.
- `i`: This is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Without knowing the previous value of `i`, we can only say it is some integer.
- `prev`: This variable is not mentioned in the initial state description, so we must assume it is defined elsewhere in the code and holds some value.

Given the information, the output will be a formatted string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1` again, and `prev`.

Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the highest value of i for which r was '<' or 0 if no such i exists, i is the current value of i after incrementing by 1, and prev is the value of the prev variable)**

Since we don't have specific values for `v1`, `i`, and `prev`, we express them in terms of their descriptions.
