The code snippet `prev = i` updates the value of `prev` to the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the index of the maximum element in the array, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is `i`, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `prev` is now set to the value of `i`. All other variables retain their original values.
