To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **Variable `i`:** This variable is the loop counter and is automatically initialized to 1 at the start of the loop. Therefore, there is no need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

2. **Variable `n`:** This variable determines the upper bound of the loop. For the loop to execute even once, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`. If `n` is 1, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Variables `t`, `g`, and `v1`:** These variables are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. They can remain as they are.

Given these considerations, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0**
