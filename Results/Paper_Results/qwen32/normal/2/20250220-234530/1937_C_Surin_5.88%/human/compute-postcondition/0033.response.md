Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `r` is an input string.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to whatever the user inputs, while all other variables remain unchanged.
