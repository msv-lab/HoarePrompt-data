To determine the output of the given print statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³.
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `g` is initialized to 0.
- `v2` is set to `i`.
- `v1` is set to `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0.

### Key Points:
- The value of `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value.
- The value of `r` is also not explicitly mentioned, so we need to consider both possibilities: `r` could be `<` or something else.

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `v2`:**
   - `v2` is directly assigned the value of `i`.

2. **Value of `v1`:**
   - If `r` equals `<`, then `v1` is set to `i`.
   - Otherwise, `v1` remains 0.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1: `r` equals `<`**
  - In this case, `v1` is set to `i`.
  - The print statement becomes: `? i i i i`.

- **Scenario 2: `r` does not equal `<`**
  - In this case, `v1` remains 0.
  - The print statement becomes: `? 0 0 i i`.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of specific values for `i` and `r`, we need to account for both scenarios. However, since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we'll represent it symbolically.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] (where v1 is i if r equals '<', otherwise v1 is 0, and v2 is i)**
