The code snippet provided is simply taking an integer input and assigning it to the variable `n`. This means that the value of `n` will change based on the user's input, but all other variables (`t`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, `kp`) will remain unchanged.

Given that `n` is reassigned, the new value of `n` will be whatever integer is provided by the input. The other variables retain their initial values as specified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`**.
