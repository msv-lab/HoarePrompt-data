To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the for loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` generates numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

The variables `t`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, and `kp` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. They are mentioned in the initial state but are irrelevant to the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `kp` is incremented by 1 for each iteration**
