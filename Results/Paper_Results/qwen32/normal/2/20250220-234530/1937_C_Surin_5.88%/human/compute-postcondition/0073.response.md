To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `v2` is set to the value of `i`.

### Variables:
- `v1`: This variable is not mentioned in the initial state, so its value is unknown.
- `v2`: This variable is explicitly set to the value of `i` after `i` has been incremented by 1.

### Steps:
1. Since `i` is incremented by 1, we need to know the initial value of `i` to determine its new value. However, the initial value of `i` is not provided in the precondition. Let's denote the initial value of `i` as `i_initial`.
2. After incrementing, `i` becomes `i_initial + 1`.
3. `v2` is then assigned the value of `i`, so `v2 = i_initial + 1`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Output Analysis:
- The first placeholder `{v1}` will be replaced with the value of `v1`.
- The second placeholder `{v1}` will also be replaced with the value of `v1`.
- The third placeholder `{v2}` will be replaced with the value of `v2`, which is `i_initial + 1`.
- The fourth placeholder `{v2}` will also be replaced with the value of `v2`, which is `i_initial + 1`.

Since the initial value of `i` (`i_initial`) and the value of `v1` are not specified, we cannot determine their exact numerical values. Therefore, the output will be described in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [v1] [v1] [i_initial + 1] [i_initial + 1] (where v1 is the value of v1 and i_initial is the initial value of i)**
