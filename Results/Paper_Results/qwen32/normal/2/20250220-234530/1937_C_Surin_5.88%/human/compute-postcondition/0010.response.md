The code snippet `r = input('')` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, or `v2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is the value of `i`, `r` is the user's input.**
