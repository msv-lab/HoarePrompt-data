To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string, `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `r` is '>', `prev` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop statement, we know that `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `i` should be incremented again by 1 from its current value.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `n` remains the same as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Other variables (`t`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `r`, `prev`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be modified based on the given information.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string, `i` is incremented by 1 (from its current value), `prev` is set to `i` if `r` is '>', otherwise `prev` remains 0**.

Since we are only adjusting the state of `i` and `n` based on the loop head, the final simplified state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string, `i` is incremented by 1**.
