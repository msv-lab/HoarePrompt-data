Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i + 1`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `v2` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is then incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
