Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `g` is 0 (though `g` is not used in the print statement).
- `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `v2` is `n-1` (though `v2` is not used in the print statement).
- `prev` is 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is described as the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists. Since there is no information about `r` or any loop that would set `v1` to a specific value other than 0, we assume `v1` is 0.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since it is not mentioned, we cannot determine its value from the given information. Therefore, `i` remains undefined.
- `prev` is explicitly stated to be 0.

Given these points, the print statement will output:
- `v1` as 0.
- `i` as undefined (which means it will raise an error if `i` is not defined elsewhere in the code).
- `v1` again as 0.
- `prev` as 0.

However, since the problem asks for the most precise description possible based on the precondition, and `i` is undefined, we should note this in our answer.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 [undefined] 0 0 (where i is undefined)**
