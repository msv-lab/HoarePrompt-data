To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. This variable does not directly affect the print statement.
2. **n**: Greater than 1. This variable indicates the size of some array or list, but it doesn't directly influence the specific print statement.
3. **g**: Set to 0. This variable is not used in the print statement.
4. **v1**: The index of the maximum element in the array. This means `v1` is an integer between 0 and n-1.
5. **v2**: Set to `n-1`. This variable is not used in the print statement.
6. **prev**: Set to `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged. Since `prev` is not specified to be anything else, we assume it retains its previous value or is set to `i` based on the condition.
7. **kp**: Set to `n-1`. This variable is not used in the print statement.
8. **r**: A new input string. This string influences the value of `prev` but does not directly affect the print statement.
9. **i**: Incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`). This means `i` is an integer that has been incremented from its previous value.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

This statement will print a formatted string with the following components:
- `'?'`: A literal question mark.
- `{v1}`: The index of the maximum element in the array.
- `{i}`: The current value of `i` after incrementing.
- `{v1}`: The index of the maximum element in the array (repeated).
- `{prev}`: The value of `prev`, which is either `i` if `r` equals `'>'`, or its previous value.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the output will be:
- A question mark `'?'`.
- Followed by the index of the maximum element in the array (`v1`).
- Followed by the current value of `i` after incrementing.
- Followed by the index of the maximum element in the array again (`v1`).
- Finally, the value of `prev`, which depends on whether `r` was `'>'` or not.

Thus, the output can be described as:
Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the index of the maximum element in the array, i is the incremented value of i, and prev is i if r equals '>', otherwise it retains its previous value)**
