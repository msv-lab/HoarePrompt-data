To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to analyze how the variables evolve with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, it prints a query and reads a response `r`.
- If `r` is `'<'`, it updates `v1` to the current value of `i`.

### Final State Determination
- After the loop completes, `i` will have taken on all values from 1 to `n-1`.
- The variable `v1` will hold the highest value of `i` for which the response `r` was `'<'`. If no response was `'<'`, `v1` will remain 0.
- The variable `v2` will hold the last value of `i` that was considered, which is `n-1`.
- The variable `g` remains unchanged at 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

### Output State
- `t`: Remains the same as the initial state (1 ≤ t ≤ 10³).
- `n`: Remains the same as the initial state (n ≥ 1).
- `g`: Remains 0.
- `v1`: Holds the highest value of `i` for which `r` was `'<'`, or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `v2`: Holds the value `n-1`.

### Final Output State in Specified Format
Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, g is 0, v1 is the highest value of i for which r was '<', or 0 if no such i exists, v2 is n-1.**

### Natural Language Explanation
After the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `t` and `n` retain their initial values. The variable `g` remains 0. The variable `v1` will be the largest index `i` for which the response to the query was `'<'`, or 0 if no such index existed. The variable `v2` will be the last index considered by the loop, which is `n-1`.
