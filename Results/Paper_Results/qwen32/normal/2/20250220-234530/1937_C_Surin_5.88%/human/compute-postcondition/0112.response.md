The code assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given that `v2` is initially set to `i`, after the assignment, `v1` will also hold the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string, and `r` is equal to '<'**.
