The given code snippet only modifies the value of the variable `prev`. It sets `prev` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `kp` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.**
