To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `i` and the range `1, n`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if there is at least one value of `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means that `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Let's analyze the provided state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³ (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `n` is the input integer (This variable is part of the loop head and affects the loop execution).
- `g` is 0 (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `v1` is 0 (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `v2` is `n-1` (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop execution directly).
- `kp` is `n-1` (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop execution directly).

Since the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2. The initial value of `i` in the loop will be 1, as specified in the range.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`**
