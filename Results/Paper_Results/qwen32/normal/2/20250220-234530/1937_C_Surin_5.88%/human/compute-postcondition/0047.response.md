The code assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `prev`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest value of `i` for which `r` was '<', or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string, `i` is incremented by 1, `prev` is equal to `i`**.
