To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided code and the given states after the first three iterations.

Here's the loop again for reference:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
    sys.stdout.flush()
    r = input()
    if r == '>':
        prev = i
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `g` is 0.
   - `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - `v2` is `n-1`.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - `kp` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, it prints a query and reads a response `r`.
   - If `r` is '>', it updates `prev` to the current `i`.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the loop completes, `i` will have reached `n-1`.
   - `kp` will have been incremented `n-1` times.
   - `prev` will hold the highest index `i` for which `r` was '>'.
   - `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop (which they are not).

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute `n-1` times.
- `prev` will be the highest index `i` where `r` was '>', or it will remain 0 if no such `i` exists.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`) remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing all iterations, `t`, `n`, `g`, and `v2` remain unchanged. `prev` holds the highest index `i` where the response `r` was '>', or it remains 0 if no such `i` exists. The variable `kp` is equal to `n-1` because the loop ran `n-1` times.
