The provided code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer to ensure that all buffered output is written to the output device. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v2` is `i`
- `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` remains 0

Since `sys.stdout.flush()` does not modify any variables, the values of `t`, `n`, `g`, `v2`, and `v1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `<`; otherwise, `v1` is 0**.
