The given code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is used to flush the output buffer. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, and `kp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` is the input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '<' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`.**
