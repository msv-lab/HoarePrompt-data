The code snippet `r = input('')` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, `prev`, `kp`) are affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `prev` is the highest index `i` where `r` was '>' or 0 if no such `i` exists, `kp` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string.**
