To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and compare it with the problem description and the function summary provided. Let's break down the code and the logic step-by-step.

### Problem Recap

- **Board Setup**: A checkered board with `h` rows and `w` columns.
- **Initial Positions**: Alice at `(xa, ya)` and Bob at `(xb, yb)`.
- **Movement Rules**:
  - Alice can move down, down-left, or down-right.
  - Bob can move up, up-left, or up-right.
- **Winning Condition**: A player wins if they land on the opponent's chip.
- **Draw Condition**: If a player cannot make a move, the game ends in a draw.

### Key Observations

1. **Initial Position Comparison**:
   - If `xa > xb`, Alice is initially below Bob. Since Alice can only move down, she can never reach Bob's initial position, and Bob can always move up to avoid Alice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw.
   - If `xa <= xb`, Alice can potentially reach Bob's position.

2. **Movement Analysis**:
   - When `xa <= xb`, Alice needs to cover the vertical distance `abs(xa - xb)`. She can move diagonally or straight down.
   - Bob, starting above Alice, can move diagonally or straight up.

### Code Analysis

Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
```

#### Case 1: `xa > xb`
- The code correctly identifies this scenario and prints "Draw".

#### Case 2: `xa <= xb`
- **Vertical Distance Calculation**: `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`
  - This represents the maximum number of diagonal moves Alice can make towards Bob.
- **Odd Vertical Distance** (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`):
  - The code calculates the horizontal range `[l, r]` where Alice can potentially land after moving diagonally.
  - `l = max(1, yb - x)`
  - `r = min(w, yb + x)`
  - It then checks if Alice can land within this range horizontally after moving diagonally.
  - The condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` is used to determine if Alice can win.
- **Even Vertical Distance** (`abs(xa - xb) % 2 == 0`):
  - Similar calculations are done for Bob.
  - `l = max(1, ya - x)`
  - `r = min(w, yb + x)`
  - The condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` is used to determine if Bob can win.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Horizontal Range Calculation**:
   - The horizontal range `[l, r]` is calculated based on the vertical distance `x`. However, the logic for determining the winning condition is flawed.
   - The conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` do not accurately reflect the possible winning scenarios for Alice and Bob.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases where Alice or Bob cannot make any moves due to board boundaries.

### Correct Approach

To correctly determine the winner or draw condition, we need to simulate the optimal moves for both players and check if either can force a win. The current logic in the code does not accurately simulate these optimal moves.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner or draw condition based on the problem's rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
