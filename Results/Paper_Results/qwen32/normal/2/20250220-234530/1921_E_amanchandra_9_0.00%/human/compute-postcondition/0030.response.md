Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is updated to `i + 2`.
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Draw')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'Draw'`.

### Explanation:
- The value of `t`, `i`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.
- The string `'Draw'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement, so it will be printed as is.

### Final Output:
Output: **Draw**
