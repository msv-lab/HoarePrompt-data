Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who move their chips on a checkered board according to specific rules. Alice can only move downwards, diagonally down-left, or diagonally down-right, while Bob can only move upwards, diagonally up-left, or diagonally up-right. The game ends when one player lands on the same cell as the other, or when a player cannot make any more moves.

The key points to consider are:
1. **Initial Conditions**: Alice starts at `(xa, ya)` and Bob starts at `(xb, yb)`.
2. **Movement Constraints**: Alice can only move down, while Bob can only move up.
3. **Winning Condition**: A player wins if they land on the opponent's chip.
4. **Draw Condition**: If a player cannot make a move, the game ends in a draw.

### Strategy

The strategy revolves around the relative positions of Alice and Bob:
- If `xa > xb`, Alice is initially below Bob. Since Alice can only move down, she can never reach Bob's initial position, and Bob can always move up to avoid Alice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw.
- If `xa <= xb`, Alice can potentially reach Bob's position. We need to determine if Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position.

### Detailed Reasoning

The code logic is as follows:
- If `xa > xb`, it prints "Draw".
- Otherwise, it calculates the maximum distance Alice can move vertically towards Bob (`x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`).
  - If the distance is odd, it checks if Alice can move horizontally within the bounds of the board to potentially land on Bob's column. If yes, Alice wins; otherwise, it's a draw.
  - If the distance is even, it checks if Bob can move horizontally within the bounds of the board to potentially land on Alice's column. If yes, Bob wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

### Code Analysis

Let's break down the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
```

- The condition `if xa > xb` correctly handles the scenario where Alice is initially below Bob, resulting in a draw.
- For the case where `xa <= xb`, the code calculates the maximum vertical distance Alice can cover (`x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`).
- The subsequent checks for horizontal movement are intended to determine if Alice or Bob can win based on the calculated vertical distance.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The calculation of `l` and `r` seems incorrect. Specifically, the ranges should be adjusted based on the actual movement possibilities.
- The conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` do not accurately reflect the possible winning scenarios for Alice.
- Similarly, the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x` do not accurately reflect the possible winning scenarios for Bob.

### Conclusion

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner or draw condition based on the problem's rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
