You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a grid's height (`h`) and width (`w`), and the coordinates of two points (`(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`). For each test case, it determines and prints the winner between Alice and Bob based on their positions and the grid dimensions, or declares a draw.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board with `h` rows and `w` columns.
- Alice starts at `(xa, ya)` and Bob starts at `(xb, yb)`.
- Alice moves down, down-left, or down-right.
- Bob moves up, up-left, or up-right.
- A player wins if they move onto the opponent's position.
- If a player cannot make a move, the game is a draw.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to determine the winner based on the initial positions of Alice and Bob. Here's the logic breakdown:

1. **Initial Check**: If `xa > xb`, the program outputs "Draw". This implies that if Alice starts below Bob, the game is a draw. However, this is not necessarily true because Alice could still win if she can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach hers.
   
2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`. This seems to be an attempt to determine how many moves it would take for Alice to potentially meet Bob vertically.
   - If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is non-zero, it means the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is odd.
     - It then calculates the range `[l, r]` of columns Bob can reach within `x + 1` moves.
     - If Alice can reach within this range, the program outputs "Alice".
     - Otherwise, it outputs "Draw".
   - If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is zero, it means the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is even.
     - It then calculates the range `[l, r]` of columns Bob can reach within `x` moves.
     - If Bob can reach within this range, the program outputs "Bob".
     - Otherwise, it outputs "Draw".

### Potential Issues:
1. **Initial Check (`xa > xb`)**:
   - This check is incorrect because it assumes that if Alice starts below Bob, the game is always a draw. This is not true because Alice could still win if she can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach hers.

2. **Range Calculation**:
   - The range calculations seem to be based on the assumption that the horizontal movement is directly proportional to the vertical movement, which is not necessarily true. The program does not account for all possible paths Alice and Bob can take to reach each other.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where Alice or Bob is already at the boundary of the board or very close to it.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all scenarios described in the problem statement. Specifically, the initial check and the range calculations are flawed.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program incorrectly assumes that if Alice starts below Bob (`xa > xb`), the game is always a draw. Additionally, the range calculations do not account for all possible paths Alice and Bob can take to reach each other, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
