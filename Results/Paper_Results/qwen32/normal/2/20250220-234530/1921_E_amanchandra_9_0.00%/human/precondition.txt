h and w are positive integers representing the dimensions of the board (1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9). x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b are positive integers representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips respectively (1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w). It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not coincide (i.e., either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b). There are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
