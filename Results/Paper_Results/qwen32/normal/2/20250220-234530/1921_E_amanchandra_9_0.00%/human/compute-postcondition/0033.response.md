The given code calculates the minimum value between `w` and `yb + x` and assigns it to the variable `r`. Here's the updated state after the code executes:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` remains `i + 2`.
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` remain the integers obtained from the input.
- `x` remains `abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
- `l` remains `max(1, yb - x)`.
- `r` is now the minimum value between `w` and `yb + x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `i + 2`, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input, `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`, `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`**.
