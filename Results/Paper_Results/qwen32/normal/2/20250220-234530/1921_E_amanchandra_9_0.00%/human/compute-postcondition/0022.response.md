To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the code and the initial state step-by-step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is `i + 1` (though `i` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are integers obtained from the input.
- `x` is calculated as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
- `l` is calculated as `max(1, yb - x)`.
- `r` is calculated as `min(w, yb + x)`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
```

Let's break this down:

1. The expression `['Draw'], ['Alice']` creates a tuple of two lists: `(['Draw'], ['Alice'])`.
2. The expression `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` evaluates to either `True` or `False`.
   - If the condition is `True`, it selects the second element of the tuple, which is `['Alice']`.
   - If the condition is `False`, it selects the first element of the tuple, which is `['Draw']`.
3. The `*` operator unpacks the selected list, so if `['Alice']` is selected, it prints `'Alice'`, and if `['Draw']` is selected, it prints `'Draw'`.

### Condition Explanation:
- `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` checks if the vertical distance between `l` and `ya` is within `x + 1`.
- `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` checks if the vertical distance between `r` and `ya` is within `x + 1`.
- If both conditions are satisfied, the code prints `'Alice'`; otherwise, it prints `'Draw'`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the logic of the print statement, the output depends on the values of `l`, `ya`, `r`, and `x`.

- If both `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` are true, the output is `'Alice'`.
- Otherwise, the output is `'Draw'`.

Since the exact values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical result. However, based on the given conditions, we can describe the output precisely.

Output: **Alice (if abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1, otherwise Draw)**
