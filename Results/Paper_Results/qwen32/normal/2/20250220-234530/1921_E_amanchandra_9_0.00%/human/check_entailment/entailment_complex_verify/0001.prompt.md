You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a grid's height (`h`) and width (`w`), and the coordinates of two points (`(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`). For each test case, it determines and prints the winner between Alice and Bob based on their positions and the grid dimensions, or declares a draw.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who move their chips on a checkered board according to specific rules. Alice can only move downwards, diagonally down-left, or diagonally down-right, while Bob can only move upwards, diagonally up-left, or diagonally up-right. The game ends when one player lands on the same cell as the other, or when a player cannot make any more moves.

The key points to consider are:
1. **Initial Conditions**: Alice starts at `(xa, ya)` and Bob starts at `(xb, yb)`.
2. **Movement Constraints**: Alice can only move down, while Bob can only move up.
3. **Winning Condition**: A player wins if they land on the opponent's chip.
4. **Draw Condition**: If a player cannot make a move, the game ends in a draw.

### Strategy

The strategy revolves around the relative positions of Alice and Bob:
- If `xa > xb`, Alice is initially below Bob. Since Alice can only move down, she can never reach Bob's initial position, and Bob can always move up to avoid Alice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw.
- If `xa <= xb`, Alice can potentially reach Bob's position. We need to determine if Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position.

### Detailed Reasoning

The code logic is as follows:
- If `xa > xb`, it prints "Draw".
- Otherwise, it calculates the maximum distance Alice can move vertically towards Bob (`x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`).
  - If the distance is odd, it checks if Alice can move horizontally within the bounds of the board to potentially land on Bob's column. If yes, Alice wins; otherwise, it's a draw.
  - If the distance is even, it checks if Bob can move horizontally within the bounds of the board to potentially land on Alice's column. If yes, Bob wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

### Code Analysis

Let's break down the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
```

- The condition `if xa > xb` correctly handles the scenario where Alice is initially below Bob, resulting in a draw.
- For the case where `xa <= xb`, the code calculates the maximum vertical distance Alice can cover (`x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`).
- The subsequent checks for horizontal movement are intended to determine if Alice or Bob can win based on the calculated vertical distance.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The calculation of `l` and `r` seems incorrect. Specifically, the ranges should be adjusted based on the actual movement possibilities.
- The conditions `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` do not accurately reflect the possible winning scenarios for Alice.
- Similarly, the conditions `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x` do not accurately reflect the possible winning scenarios for Bob.

### Conclusion

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner or draw condition based on the problem's rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
