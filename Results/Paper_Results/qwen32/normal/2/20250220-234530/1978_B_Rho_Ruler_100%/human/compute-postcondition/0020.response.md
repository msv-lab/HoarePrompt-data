To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables `low` and `high` since they are the only ones mentioned in the loop condition `while low <= high`.

Given the information:
- `low` and `high` are adjusted based on the comparison between `profit_next` and `profit_mid`.
- `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
- The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `low` must be less than or equal to `high` after the adjustments.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

1. If `profit_next > profit_mid`:
   - `low` is set to `mid + 1`.
   - `high` remains as either `min(n, b)` or `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`.

2. Otherwise:
   - `low` is set according to some logic (either `mid + 1` or `0`).
   - `high` is set to `mid - 1`.

In both cases, the key is to ensure that after these adjustments, `low` is still less than or equal to `high`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_next`, and `profit_mid` after the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the conditions allow for another iteration. Therefore, we need to set `low` and `high` such that `low <= high` holds true.

### Example Adjustment:
If after the previous iteration, `low` was set to `mid + 1` and `high` was set to `mid - 1`, then clearly `low` would be greater than `high`, and the loop would terminate. To avoid this, we need to ensure that `low` is not incremented beyond `high`.

### Solution:
To guarantee that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `low` is less than or equal to `high` after the adjustments. Since the exact values are not specified, we can assume that `low` and `high` were set in such a way that `low` is still less than or equal to `high`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers. `low` and `high` are adjusted such that `low` is less than or equal to `high`. `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`. `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are the results of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)` respectively. `max_profit` is the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`.**
