To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `low <= high`.

Given the provided information:
- `low` is set to either `mid + 1` or `0`.
- `high` is set to either `min(n, b)` or `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`.

For the loop to continue executing, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

1. If `profit_next > profit_mid`, then:
   - `low` is set to `mid + 1`.
   - `high` remains `min(n, b)`.

2. Otherwise:
   - `low` remains `0`.
   - `high` is set to `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`.

In both scenarios, we need to ensure that `low <= high` for the loop to continue.

### Adjusting the State

#### Scenario 1: `profit_next > profit_mid`
- `low` is set to `mid + 1`.
- `high` remains `min(n, b)`.

For the loop to continue:
- `mid + 1 <= min(n, b)` must hold true.

Since `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`, `mid + 1` should be less than or equal to `min(n, b)`. This condition is generally satisfied unless `min(n, b)` is `0` or `1`, but since `n` and `b` are positive integers, `min(n, b)` is at least `1`. Therefore, `mid + 1` will be at most `min(n, b)`.

#### Scenario 2: `profit_next <= profit_mid`
- `low` remains `0`.
- `high` is set to `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`.

For the loop to continue:
- `0 <= (min(n, b)) // 2 - 1` must hold true.

This condition is satisfied as long as `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1` is non-negative, which means `min(n, b)` must be at least `2`.

### Conclusion

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `low <= high` holds true in both scenarios. Given the conditions, we can ensure this by setting `low` and `high` appropriately based on the logic described.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:
- Ensure `low` and `high` are set according to the logic described above.
- Specifically, ensure `low <= high` holds true.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `low` is set according to the logic (either `mid + 1` or `0`), `high` is set according to the logic (either `min(n, b)` or `(min(n, b)) // 2 - 1`), and `low <= high` holds true.**
