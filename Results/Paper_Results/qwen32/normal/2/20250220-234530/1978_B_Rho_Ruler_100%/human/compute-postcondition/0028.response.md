To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the binary search-like process described in the loop. The loop adjusts the `low` and `high` bounds based on the comparison between `profit_mid` and `profit_next`, aiming to find the maximum profit.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `low` starts at 0.
   - `high` starts at `min(n, b)`.
   - `max_profit` starts at 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.
   - In each iteration, `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
   - `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are computed using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, respectively.
   - `max_profit` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `profit_mid`.
   - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is incremented to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `high` is decremented to `mid - 1`.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`.
   - At this point, `max_profit` holds the maximum profit found during the iterations.

Given the nature of the binary search, the loop will terminate when `low` and `high` converge to a single value or cross each other. The final value of `max_profit` will be the maximum profit achievable under the given conditions.

### Final Output State

- `low` will be greater than `high` after the loop terminates.
- `max_profit` will be the highest profit found during the iterations.
- `mid`, `profit_mid`, and `profit_next` will be the last values computed in the loop, but they are not relevant outside the loop.

Thus, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `max_profit` is the maximum profit found.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations, the loop will stop with `low` being greater than `high`, and `max_profit` will contain the highest profit that could be achieved given the initial conditions and the function `func_1`.
