You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:

1. `func_1(k, n, a, b)`: This function calculates the profit for a given `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b` according to the formula:
   \[
   \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
   \]
   This formula correctly calculates the total profit by considering the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.

2. `func_2(n, a, b)`: This function uses a binary search approach to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit. It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`. It then iteratively adjusts `low` and `high` based on the comparison between the profit at the midpoint (`mid`) and the profit at the next point (`mid + 1`). The maximum profit found during this process is returned.

### Correctness Verification

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that:
- The profit calculation in `func_1` is correct.
- The binary search in `func_2` correctly identifies the value of `k` that maximizes the profit.

#### Profit Calculation in `func_1`
The formula used in `func_1` is derived from the problem statement. For a given `k`, the profit is calculated as:
- The sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence `b, b-1, b-2, ..., b-k+1`, which is equivalent to `k * b - k * (k - 1) / 2`.
- The profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`, which is `(n - k) * a`.

This formula correctly computes the profit for any valid `k`.

#### Binary Search in `func_2`
The binary search in `func_2` is designed to efficiently find the maximum profit by comparing the profit at the midpoint and the next point. The search space is correctly bounded by `0` and `min(n, b)`, ensuring that `k` remains within the valid range.

The binary search logic is correct because:
- If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, it means that increasing `k` could potentially yield a higher profit, so `low` is adjusted to `mid + 1`.
- Otherwise, `high` is adjusted to `mid - 1`, indicating that the maximum profit is likely to be at a smaller `k`.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, both functions appear to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The profit calculation is accurate, and the binary search effectively finds the optimal value of `k` to maximize the profit.

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit by using a binary search to find the optimal value of `k`. The profit calculation formula in `func_1` is accurate, and the binary search in `func_2` ensures that the maximum profit is found efficiently.
