The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `min(n, b)`, `mid` will be `(0 + min(n, b)) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, and `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price; `low` is 0, `high` is `min(n, b)`, `max_profit` is 0, `mid` is `(min(n, b)) // 2`**.
