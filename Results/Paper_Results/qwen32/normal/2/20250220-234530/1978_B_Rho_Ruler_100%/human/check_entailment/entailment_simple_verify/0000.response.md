### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, code, and annotations.

#### Function `func_1(k, n, a, b)`
This function calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula:
\[ \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \]

This formula is derived correctly from the problem statement:
- The first part, \( k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \), represents the sum of the prices of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
- The second part, \( (n - k) \cdot a \), represents the profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price.

Thus, the profit calculation in `func_1` is correct.

#### Function `func_2(n, a, b)`
This function uses binary search to find the value of `k` that maximizes the profit. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the binary search logic:
1. Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`.
2. While `low` is less than or equal to `high`:
   - Calculate `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - Compute `profit_mid` using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.
   - Compute `profit_next` using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
   - Update `max_profit` to be the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
   - Adjust `low` and `high` based on the comparison between `profit_mid` and `profit_next`.

The binary search logic is correct because:
- If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, it indicates that increasing `k` might yield a higher profit, so `low` is set to `mid + 1`.
- Otherwise, `high` is set to `mid - 1`, suggesting that the maximum profit is likely to be at a smaller `k`.

The binary search ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently within the range `[0, min(n, b)]`.

#### Edge Cases
Let's consider some edge cases:
1. **When `k = 0`**: All buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
2. **When `k = min(n, b)`**: The first `min(n, b)` buns are sold at the modified price, and the remaining buns (if any) are sold at the usual price `a`.
3. **When `n = 1`**: Only one bun is available, and the optimal `k` is either 0 or 1 depending on the values of `a` and `b`.

All these cases are handled correctly by the binary search in `func_2`.

### Conclusion
After a thorough analysis, both `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly. The profit calculation in `func_1` is accurate, and the binary search in `func_2` efficiently finds the optimal value of `k` to maximize the profit.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
