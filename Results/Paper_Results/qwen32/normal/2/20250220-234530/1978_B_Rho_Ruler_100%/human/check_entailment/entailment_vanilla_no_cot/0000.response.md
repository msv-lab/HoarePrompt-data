To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly finds the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions.

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has `n` buns.
   - He can choose an integer `k` such that `0 <= k <= min(n, b)`.
   - The first `k` buns are sold at prices `(b - i + 1)` for `i = 1, 2, ..., k`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the value of `k` that maximizes the total profit.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit from the first `k` buns: `sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(1, k + 1)) = k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`
   - Profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns: `(n - k) * a`
   - Total profit: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - `func_1(k, n, a, b)` calculates the total profit for a given `k`.
   - `func_2(n, a, b)` performs a binary search over possible values of `k` to find the maximum profit.
   - Binary search is used because the profit function is unimodal (it increases up to a point and then decreases).

5. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`.
   - While `low <= high`, calculate the middle point `mid`.
   - Calculate the profit for `mid` and `mid + 1`.
   - Update `max_profit` with the maximum of current `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.
   - If `profit_next` (profit for `mid + 1`) is greater than `profit_mid`, move `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the higher half.
   - Otherwise, move `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the lower half.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit using binary search. It efficiently narrows down the optimal value of `k` by comparing profits at the midpoint and its successor, ensuring that the maximum profit is found within the constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
