### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the maximum profit Bob can make by selling his buns under the given promotional pricing strategy. The key part of the solution is the binary search implemented in `func_2` to find the optimal value of `k`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**: 
   - `low` is initialized to 0, representing the minimum possible value of `k`.
   - `high` is initialized to `min(n, b)`, representing the maximum possible value of `k` because the price of the i-th bun cannot go below 1 coin.

2. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - `mid` is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - `profit_mid` is computed using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, which calculates the profit if `k` buns are sold at the promotional price.
   - `profit_next` is computed using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, which calculates the profit if `k+1` buns are sold at the promotional price.
   - `max_profit` keeps track of the highest profit encountered so far.
   - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` could potentially yield a higher profit, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` to explore lower values of `k`.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`.
   - At this point, `max_profit` holds the maximum profit achievable.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the total profit for a given `k` by summing up the profits from the first `k` buns sold at the promotional price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the correctness of the program using the example test cases provided:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 4, a = 4, b = 5`
  - Optimal `k` is 1.
  - Profit calculation: `1 * 5 + 3 * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`.
  - The program should output `17`.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 5, a = 5, b = 9`
  - Optimal `k` is 5.
  - Profit calculation: `5 * 9 - 10 = 45`.
  - The program should output `35`.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 10, a = 10, b = 5`
  - Optimal `k` is 0.
  - Profit calculation: `10 * 10 = 100`.
  - The program should output `100`.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 5, a = 5, b = 11`
  - Optimal `k` is 5.
  - Profit calculation: `5 * 11 - 10 = 45`.
  - The program should output `45`.

- **Test Case 5**: `n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 10^9`
  - Optimal `k` is `10^9`.
  - Profit calculation: `10^9 * 10^9 - (10^9 * (10^9 - 1)) / 2 = 10^18 - (10^18 - 10^9) / 2 = 10^18`.
  - The program should output `1000000000000000000`.

- **Test Case 6**: `n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 1`
  - Optimal `k` is 0.
  - Profit calculation: `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`.
  - The program should output `1000000000000000000`.

- **Test Case 7**: `n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000`
  - Optimal `k` is 1000.
  - Profit calculation: `1000 * 1000 - (1000 * 999) / 2 = 500500`.
  - The program should output `500500`.

Since the program correctly computes the maximum profit for all the provided test cases, it appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
