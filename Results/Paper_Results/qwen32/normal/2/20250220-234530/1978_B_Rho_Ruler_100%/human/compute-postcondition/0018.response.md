The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `low` is set according to the logic (either `mid + 1` or `0`), `high` is `mid - 1`, `low <= high` may or may not hold true after this change, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of its previous value and `profit_mid`.**
