To determine the new output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the existing variables:

Given Initial State:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 1
- `n` is at least 9
- `m` is at least 3
- `y_final` is the largest integer such that `(1 + y_final) * y_final > m`
- `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // (1 + y), m // ((1 + y) * y))` for all `y` from 2 to `y_final`.
- The greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.

Code Snippet:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

Since `x` is 2 and `y` is 1, the expression becomes:
```python
cnt += min(n // ((2 + 1) * 2), m // ((2 + 1) * 1))
cnt += min(n // 6, m // 3)
```

This means that `cnt` will be incremented by the minimum value between `n // 6` and `m // 3`.

The other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, `y_final`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the updated `cnt` will be the original `cnt` plus the calculated minimum value.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 1, `n` is at least 9, `m` is at least 3, `y_final` is the largest integer such that `(1 + y_final) * y_final > m`, `cnt` is the original `cnt` plus `min(n // 6, m // 3)`, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.**
