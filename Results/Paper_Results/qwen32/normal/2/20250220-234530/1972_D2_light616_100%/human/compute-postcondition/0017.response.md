Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `m` must be at least 12, `x` is 1, `y` is 4, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1, and `cnt` is increased by `min(n // 3, m // 6) + min(n // 4, m // 12)` since the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `y` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
