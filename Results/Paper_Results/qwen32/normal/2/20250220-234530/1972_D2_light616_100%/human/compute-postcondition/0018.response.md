To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the conditions under which the loop continues to execute and how the variables change during each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
- **Body**:
  - If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, increment `cnt` by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
  - Increment `y` by 1.

### Initial State:
- `n >= 1`
- `m` is an integer
- `x = 1`
- `cnt = 0`
- `y = 1`

### Iteration Details:
- **First Iteration** (`y = 2`):
  - Condition: `(1 + 2) * 1 <= n` and `(1 + 2) * 2 <= m` → `3 <= n` and `6 <= m`
  - If `gcd(1, 2) == 1` (which it is), `cnt += min(n // 3, m // 6)`
  
- **Second Iteration** (`y = 3`):
  - Condition: `(1 + 3) * 1 <= n` and `(1 + 3) * 3 <= m` → `4 <= n` and `12 <= m`
  - If `gcd(1, 3) == 1` (which it is), `cnt += min(n // 4, m // 12)`
  
- **Third Iteration** (`y = 4`):
  - Condition: `(1 + 4) * 1 <= n` and `(1 + 4) * 4 <= m` → `5 <= n` and `20 <= m`
  - If `gcd(1, 4) == 1` (which it is), `cnt += min(n // 5, m // 20)`

### General Pattern:
The loop will continue until `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`. Given `x` starts at 1 and remains 1 throughout the loop, the loop will stop when `y` reaches a value such that `(1 + y) * y > m`.

### Final Output State:
The loop will execute until `y` is incremented to a value where either `(1 + y) * 1 > n` or `(1 + y) * y > m`. Therefore, the final `y` will be the largest integer such that `(1 + y) * y <= m`.

Let's denote this final `y` as `y_final`. The final `cnt` will be the sum of `min(n // ((1 + y) * 1), m // ((1 + y) * y))` for all `y` from 2 to `y_final` where `gcd(1, y) == 1` (which is always true since `gcd(1, y)` is always 1).

### Conclusion:
The final state will be:
- `x` remains 1.
- `y` will be `y_final` such that `(1 + y_final) * y_final > m`.
- `cnt` will be the sum of `min(n // (1 + y), m // ((1 + y) * y))` for all `y` from 2 to `y_final`.

Output State: **`x` is 1, `y` is `y_final` (largest integer such that `(1 + y_final) * y_final > m`), `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // (1 + y), m // ((1 + y) * y))` for all `y` from 2 to `y_final`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will keep running, incrementing `y` by 1 each time, until `(1 + y) * y` exceeds `m`. For each valid `y`, if `gcd(1, y)` is 1 (which it always is), it will add `min(n // (1 + y), m // ((1 + y) * y))` to `cnt`. The final state will reflect this process.
