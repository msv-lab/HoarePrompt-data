To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```
cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

Given:
- `x` is 3
- `y` is 3
- `n` must be at least 18
- `m` must be at least 18

First, calculate `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y`:
- `(x + y) * x = (3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`
- `(x + y) * y = (3 + 3) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18`

Next, compute `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`:
- Since `n` must be at least 18, `n // 18` will be at least 1.
- Since `m` must be at least 18, `m // 18` will be at least 1.

The `min` function will take the smaller of these two values, which is at least 1.

Finally, `cnt` is incremented by this minimum value, so `cnt` will increase by at least 1.

Output State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 3, `n` must be at least 18, `m` must be at least 18, `cnt` is increased by at least 1.**
