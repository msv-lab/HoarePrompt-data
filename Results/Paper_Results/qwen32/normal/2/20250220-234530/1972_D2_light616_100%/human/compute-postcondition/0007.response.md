Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where `t` is `0` (after decrementing by 1 for each iteration); `func_1()` has been called `t` times.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the variable `t` will be `0` because it gets decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. Additionally, the function `func_1()` will have been called as many times as the initial value of `t`.
