Functionality: **The function reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, calculates the sum of the minimum values of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1` and `x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`, and prints this sum.**
