To determine the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop progresses and accumulates the `cnt` variable based on the conditions provided.

### Loop Analysis:

1. **Outer Loop (`while x * x <= n`)**:
   - Starts with `x = 1` and increments `x` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Continues as long as `x * x` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Inner Loop (`while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`)**:
   - Starts with `y = 1` and increments `y` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Continues as long as `(x + y) * x` is less than or equal to `n` and `(x + y) * y` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - If `gcd(x, y) == 1`, it adds `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` to `cnt`.

### Given Output States After Iterations:

- **After 1st Iteration** (`x = 2`):
  - `y` reaches the largest value such that `(1 + y) * y > m`.
  - `cnt` is updated based on the values of `y` from 2 to `y_final` where `gcd(1, y) == 1`.

- **After 2nd Iteration** (`x = 3`):
  - `y` reaches the largest value such that `(3 + y) * 3 <= n` and `(3 + y) * y <= m`.
  - `cnt` is updated based on the values of `y` from 2 to `y` where `gcd(3, y) == 1`.

- **After 3rd Iteration** (`x = 4`):
  - `y` is 4.
  - `cnt` is updated by adding `min(n // 15, m // 10)` if `gcd(3, 2) == 1`.

### Final Output State:

To find the final output state, we need to continue this process until `x * x > n`. Let's summarize the steps:

1. Start with `x = 1` and increment `x` until `x * x > n`.
2. For each `x`, start `y = 1` and increment `y` until `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`.
3. For each valid pair `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1`, update `cnt` by adding `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.

### Conclusion:

The final output state will be when `x` has been incremented past the point where `x * x > n`. At this point, `x` will be the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`, and `y` will be the last value checked in the inner loop for the previous `x`.

Let's denote the final value of `x` as `x_final` and the final value of `cnt` as `cnt_final`.

**Output State: **`x` is `x_final` (smallest integer greater than the square root of `n`), `y` is the last value checked in the inner loop for the previous `x`, `cnt` is `cnt_final` (sum of all valid `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `gcd(x, y) == 1`).**

In simpler terms, the loop will stop when `x` exceeds the square root of `n`, and `cnt` will hold the total count of valid pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the given conditions.
