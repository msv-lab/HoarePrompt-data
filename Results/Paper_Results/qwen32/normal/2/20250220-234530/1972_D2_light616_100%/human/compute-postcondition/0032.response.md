To determine the output state, let's first evaluate the expression inside the `min` function:

Given:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 3
- `n` is at least 10
- `m` is at least 15

The expression inside the `min` function is:
```python
min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
```

First, calculate `(x + y) * x` and `(x + y) * y`:
- `(x + y) * x = (2 + 3) * 2 = 5 * 2 = 10`
- `(x + y) * y = (2 + 3) * 3 = 5 * 3 = 15`

Next, substitute these values into the `min` function:
- `n // 10`: Since `n` is at least 10, the minimum value of `n // 10` is `1` (when `n` is exactly 10).
- `m // 15`: Since `m` is at least 15, the minimum value of `m // 15` is `1` (when `m` is exactly 15).

Thus, the `min` function will evaluate to `min(n // 10, m // 15)`, which is at least `1`.

Finally, `cnt` is incremented by this minimum value:
- `cnt += 1` (assuming the minimum value is `1`).

Therefore, the updated value of `cnt` will be `cnt + 1`.

Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 15, `cnt` is incremented by at least 1**.
