Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is `y_final` (largest integer such that `(1 + y_final) * y_final > m`), `cnt` is the sum of `min(n // (1 + y), m // ((1 + y) * y))` for all `y` from 2 to `y_final`.**

Natural Language: The value of `x` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. The values of `y` and `cnt` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code snippet.
