Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem of generating a k-level permutation of length n.

### Problem Recap:
We need to create a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of every contiguous subarray of length `k` differ by at most 1. The value of `k` is guaranteed to be even.

### Analysis of the Code:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads the values of `n` and `k`, constructs a permutation, and prints it.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one.

#### Function `func_1()`:
- It initializes an array `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
- It iterates over the range of `k` and fills the `permutation` array in a specific pattern:
  - For each index `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`, it places the next available integer (`curr_v`) at positions `i`, `i+k`, `i+2k`, ..., until it reaches the end of the array.
  - This process ensures that the first `k` elements are filled first, then the next `k` elements starting from the second position, and so on.

#### Key Points:
- The approach aims to distribute the numbers in such a way that the sums of every `k`-length subarray are as close as possible.
- However, the code does not guarantee that the sums of every `k`-length subarray will differ by at most 1. The distribution pattern might lead to larger differences between sums of adjacent subarrays.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case: `n=2, k=2`**
   - The code will fill the array as `[1, 2]`.
   - The sum of the subarray of length 2 is `1+2=3`.
   - This satisfies the condition trivially.

2. **Test Case: `n=3, k=2`**
   - The code will fill the array as `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - The sums of the subarrays of length 2 are `1+2=3` and `2+3=5`.
   - This does not satisfy the condition since the difference is 2.

From the above analysis, we can see that the code does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all cases. Specifically, the pattern used to fill the array does not ensure that the sums of every `k`-length subarray differ by at most 1.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the sums of every `k`-length subarray in the generated permutation will differ by at most 1.

**Correctness: False**
