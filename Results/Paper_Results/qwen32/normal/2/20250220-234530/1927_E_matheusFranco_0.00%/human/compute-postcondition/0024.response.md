Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`, except the element at index 1 is `floor((n-1)/k) + 2`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 3`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1; `i` is 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `curr_v` has been incremented by 1, making it `floor((n-1)/k) + 3`. All other variables retain their initial values.
