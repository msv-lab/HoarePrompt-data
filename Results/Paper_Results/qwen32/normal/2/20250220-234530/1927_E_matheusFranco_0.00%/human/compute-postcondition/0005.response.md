To determine the output state, we need to consider the effect of calling `func_1()`. However, the definition of `func_1()` is not provided in the initial state. Since the function's behavior is unknown, we cannot determine how it affects the variables.

Given the lack of information about `func_1()`, we can only assume that the function does not alter the variable `t` unless explicitly stated otherwise. Therefore, the variable `t` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is 1**.
