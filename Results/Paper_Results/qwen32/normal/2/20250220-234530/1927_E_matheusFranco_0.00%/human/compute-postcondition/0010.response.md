To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and the given output states after specific iterations.

The loop provided is:
```python
while t > 0:
    func_1()
    t -= 1
```

### Analysis of Given Output States:
- **After 1 iteration**: `t` is greater than 0. This means the loop ran because `t` was initially greater than 0.
- **After 2 iterations**: `t` is 0. This implies that `t` was decremented twice, making it 0 after the second iteration.
- **After 3 iterations**: `t` is greater than 0 and `t` is decreased by 1. This suggests that the loop ran a third time, meaning `t` must have been at least 1 before the third iteration, and it was decremented to 0 or less after the third iteration.

### Conclusion:
From the above analysis, it's clear that the loop will continue to run as long as `t` is greater than 0. Each iteration decreases `t` by 1. Therefore, the loop will terminate when `t` becomes 0.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, `t` will be 0 because the loop condition `t > 0` will no longer be satisfied once `t` is decremented to 0.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **t is 0.**
