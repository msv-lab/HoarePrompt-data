The code snippet increments the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. Given the initial state, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is initially `1 + k`. After the increment, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `(1 + k) + k`, which simplifies to `1 + 2*k`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`, except the element at index 1 is `floor((n-1)/k) + 2` and the element at index `1 + k` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 3`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 4`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 2*k`; `i` is 1.**
