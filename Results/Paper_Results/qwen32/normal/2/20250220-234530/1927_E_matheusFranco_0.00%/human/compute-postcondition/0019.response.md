To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the `permutation` list based on the given conditions.

The loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the `permutation` list (`n`). In each iteration, it sets the value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to `curr_v`, then increments `curr_v` by 1 and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `permutation` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros.
   - `curr_v` starts at 1.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - In the first iteration, `permutation[0]` is set to 1, `curr_v` becomes 2, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `k`.
   - In the second iteration, `permutation[k]` is set to 2, `curr_v` becomes 3, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `2 * k`.
   - In the third iteration, `permutation[2 * k]` is set to 3, `curr_v` becomes 4, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `3 * k`.

This pattern continues until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than `n`. The indices being modified are `0, k, 2*k, 3*k, ..., (m-1)*k` where `(m-1)*k < n` and `m*k >= n`.

The final state will be:
- `permutation[i]` will be set to `j+1` where `i = j * k` and `j` ranges from `0` to `floor((n-1)/k)`.
- `curr_v` will be `floor((n-1)/k) + 2` because it increments once per iteration.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `floor((n-1)/k) * k + k` which is greater than or equal to `n`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `ceil(n/k) * k`.**

In simpler terms, the `permutation` list will have values `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1` at positions `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k`, and all other elements will remain `0`. The variable `curr_v` will be one more than the last value placed in the `permutation` list, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be the next multiple of `k` that would exceed `n`.
