To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is just `i`. The loop iterates over `range(k)`, meaning `i` will take values from `0` to `k-1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` has just completed its current value and is about to increment. Therefore, we need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop variable**: The loop variable in the loop head is `i`.
2. **Determine the current value of `i`**: Since the state provided does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we assume it has just finished an iteration and is about to increment.
3. **Increment `i`**: To start the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

No other variables in the provided state (`n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx`, `idx_v`, `curr_v`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i`) are part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `ceil(n/k) * k`; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent the state as follows, assuming `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `ceil(n/k) * k`; `i` is `x + 1`**.

However, since we need a concrete state and typically the first iteration starts with `i = 0`, the next iteration would start with `i = 1`. Assuming the previous iteration ended with `i = 0`, the next state would be:

State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, where `2 <= k <= n` and `k` is even; `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros with elements at indices `0, k, 2*k, ..., floor((n-1)/k)*k` set to `1, 2, 3, ..., floor((n-1)/k)+1`; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `floor((n-1)/k) + 2`; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `ceil(n/k) * k`; `i` is 1**.
