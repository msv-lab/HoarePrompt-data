Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the length of the array a. This is followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the elements of the array a. The total number of elements across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
