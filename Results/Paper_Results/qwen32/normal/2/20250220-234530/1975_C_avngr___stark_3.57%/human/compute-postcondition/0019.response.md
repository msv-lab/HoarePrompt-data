The given code snippet updates the list `a` by reading a new line of input, splitting it into individual components, converting each component to an integer, and then storing these integers in the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `max`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0 (specifically, it is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration); `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the current input; `max` is the maximum value of the minimums of all consecutive pairs in the list `a` (this value is not updated in this snippet).**
