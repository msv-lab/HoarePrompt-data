To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n):`, which means the loop variable is `i` and the range is defined by `1` and `n`.

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Variable (`i`)**: This variable is initialized automatically by the `range` function and does not need to be set before the loop starts. However, the loop will not execute if the range is empty.

2. **Range Definition (`1, n`)**: The loop will iterate from `1` to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `1`.

### Necessary Adjustments:

- **Variable `n`**: To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than `1`.
- **Variable `i`**: Since `i` is controlled by the `range` function, there is no need to initialize it before the loop starts.

### Conclusion:

The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `n`. It must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `max`, `_`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:

State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `max` is 0, and `_` is now the next iteration index (previously finished iteration index + 1)**
