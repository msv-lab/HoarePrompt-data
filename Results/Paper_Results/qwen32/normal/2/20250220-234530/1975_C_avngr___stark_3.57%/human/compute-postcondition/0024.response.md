Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the current input. If the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
