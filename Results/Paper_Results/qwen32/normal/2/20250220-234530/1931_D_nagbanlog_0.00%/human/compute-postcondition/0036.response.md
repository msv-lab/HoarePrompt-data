Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a).
- `results` is an empty list.
- For each test case (`case`), `n`, `x`, and `y` are extracted from `case['params']`.
- `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']`.
- `freq` is a dictionary that counts occurrences of tuples `(mod_x, mod_y)`.
- `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
- `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`.
- `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

### Explanation of Variables:
- `num`: This is the current number being processed from the list `a`.
- `mod_x`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x`: This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`, which represents the additional amount needed to make `num` a multiple of `x`.
- `required_mod_y`: This is the same as `mod_y` and represents the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the current number being processed (`num`), its remainders when divided by `x` and `y` (`mod_x` and `mod_y`), the additional amount needed to make `num` a multiple of `x` (`required_mod_x`), and the remainder when `num` is divided by `y` again (`required_mod_y`).

### Final Output:
Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [required_mod_y] (where num is the current number being processed from the list a, mod_x is num % x, mod_y is num % y, required_mod_x is (x - mod_x) % x, and required_mod_y is mod_y)**

This output provides a clear and precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state.
