Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values extracted from `case['params']`, `a` is the list of integers from `case['array']`, `freq` has the count of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `required_mod_y` is now set to the value of `mod_y`. All other variables retain their previously described states and values.
