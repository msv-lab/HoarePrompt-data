The given code snippet calculates `required_mod_x` using the formula `(x - mod_x) % x`. This operation ensures that `required_mod_x` is the non-negative difference between `x` and `mod_x`, effectively determining how much more is needed to reach the next multiple of `x` from `num`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes its value due to the execution of the provided code is `required_mod_x`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the final `beautiful_count` for the current test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary where `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.**

In natural language: The value of `required_mod_x` is now calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
