The given code snippet calculates the modulus of `num` with `x` and assigns it to `mod_x`. This operation updates the value of `mod_x` based on the current `num` and `x`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `mod_x`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing the final `beautiful_count` for the current test case, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary where `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `num` is the next element in the list `a`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `mod_x` is now updated to `num % x`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
