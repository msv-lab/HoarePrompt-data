Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine the new state after executing the line `mod_x = num % x`.

Here's the breakdown of the impact of the code:

- `mod_x` is recalculated using the modulus operation `num % x`. This means `mod_x` will now hold the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- All other variables retain their previous values unless explicitly modified.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `num` is the next element in `a`**.

In natural language, this means:
- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `test_cases` retains its list of test cases.
- `results` retains its list containing `beautiful_count`.
- `case` retains the next test case from `test_cases`.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their values from `case['params']`.
- `a` retains its array from `case['array']`.
- `freq` retains its dictionary with counts of `(mod_x, mod_y)`.
- `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`.
- `mod_y` retains its value as `n % y`.
- `required_mod_x` retains its value as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` retains its value as `mod_y`.
- `num` retains its value as the next element in `a`.
