To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `a`, which is `case['array']`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variable is `num`, which iterates over `a`.
2. **Determine Dependencies**: For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `a`.
3. **Adjustments**: Since `a` is `case['array']`, we need to ensure that `case` contains an array with at least one element.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `case['array']` has at least one element. Here’s how we can specify the state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (no change needed here as it doesn't affect the loop directly).
- `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a) (no change needed here as it ensures there is at least one test case).
- `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count` (no change needed here as it is used outside the loop).
- `case` is the next test case in `test_cases` (no change needed here as it is derived from `test_cases`).
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']` (no change needed here as they are derived from `case`).
- `a` is `case['array']` (we need to ensure this has at least one element).
- `freq` is an empty dictionary (no change needed here as it is used inside the loop).
- `beautiful_count` is 0 (no change needed here as it is used inside the loop).

Since `a` is `case['array']`, we need to ensure that `case['array']` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of at least one test case where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, a), `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, `case` is the next test case in `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first three elements of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` and must have at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0**
