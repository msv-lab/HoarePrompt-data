To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This represents the number of test cases.
   - `test_cases`: A list of at least one test case, where each test case is a tuple \((n, x, y, a)\).
   - `results`: A list containing the final `beautiful_count` for the current test case.
   - `case`: The next test case in `test_cases`. This is a dictionary with keys `'params'` and `'array'`.
   - `n`: The first element of `case['params']`.
   - `x`: The second element of `case['params']`.
   - `y`: The third element of `case['params']`.
   - `a`: `case['array']`, which is a list with at least one element.
   - `freq`: An empty dictionary.
   - `beautiful_count`: An integer initialized to 0.
   - `mod_x`: Calculated as `n % x`.
   - `mod_y`: Calculated as `n % y`.
   - `required_mod_x`: Calculated as \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
   - `required_mod_y`: Calculated as `mod_y`.

2. **The print statement:**
   ```python
   print(
       f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
   )
   ```

3. **Identifying the variables used in the print statement:**
   - `num`: This variable is not defined in the initial state provided. It seems like there might be a typo or missing information since `num` is not mentioned elsewhere in the given context.
   - `mod_x`: Calculated as `n % x`.
   - `mod_y`: Calculated as `n % y`.
   - `required_mod_x`: Calculated as \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
   - `required_mod_y`: Calculated as `mod_y`.

4. **Given the lack of definition for `num`, we cannot provide an exact value for it. However, we can describe the other variables based on the initial state:**
   - `mod_x` is the remainder when `n` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder when `n` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is the additional amount needed to make `n` a multiple of `x` (considering modulo operations).
   - `required_mod_y` is the same as `mod_y` because it is directly assigned from `mod_y`.

Based on the above analysis, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [n % x], mod_y: [n % y], required_mod_x: [(x - (n % x)) % x], required_mod_y: [n % y] (where num is an undefined variable, n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], and y is the third element of case['params'])**
