To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, a)`.
- `results` is a list that contains `beautiful_count`, which is incremented based on certain conditions.
- `case` is the current test case being processed from `test_cases`.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are extracted from `case['params']`.
- `a` is `case['array']`, which is a list of integers.
- `freq` is a dictionary that keeps track of counts of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.
- `num` is the current element being processed from `a`.
- `mod_x` is `num % x`.
- `mod_y` is `num % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

### Explanation:
- `num`: This is the current element from the array `a` that is being processed.
- `mod_x`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y`: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x`: This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`. It essentially represents the complement of `mod_x` with respect to `x`.
- `required_mod_y`: This is simply `mod_y`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following values for clarity:
- `num = 7`
- `x = 3`
- `y = 5`

Then:
- `mod_x = 7 % 3 = 1`
- `mod_y = 7 % 5 = 2`
- `required_mod_x = (3 - 1) % 3 = 2`
- `required_mod_y = 2`

### Output:
Based on the above calculations, the print statement would output:
Output: **Number: 7, mod_x: 1, mod_y: 2, required_mod_x: 2, required_mod_y: 2**

However, since the exact values of `num`, `x`, and `y` are not provided, we will describe the output in terms of these variables:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [num % x], mod_y: [num % y], required_mod_x: [(x - (num % x)) % x], required_mod_y: [num % y]** (where `[num]` is the current element from the array `a`, `[num % x]` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, and `[num % y]` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`).
