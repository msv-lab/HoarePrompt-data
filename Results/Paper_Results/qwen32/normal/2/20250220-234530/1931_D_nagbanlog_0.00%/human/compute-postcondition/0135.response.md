Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list `test_cases` where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, the function calculates a `beautiful_count` and returns a list of these counts.**
