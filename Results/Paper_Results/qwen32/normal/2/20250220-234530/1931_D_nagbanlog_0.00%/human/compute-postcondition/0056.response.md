To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the relevant parts of the initial state and how they contribute to the output:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `test_cases`: A list of at least one test case, where each test case is a tuple \((n, x, y, a)\).
   - `results`: A list containing `beautiful_count`.
   - `case`: The next test case in `test_cases`.
   - `n`, `x`, and `y`: The first three elements of `case['params']`.
   - `a`: `case['array']` and must have at least one element.
   - `freq`: An empty dictionary.
   - `beautiful_count`: Initialized to 0.
   - `mod_x`: Calculated as `n % x`.
   - `mod_y`: Calculated as `n % y`.
   - `required_mod_x`: Calculated as \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
   - `required_mod_y`: Calculated as `mod_y`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement outputs several variables: `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`.

However, there is a discrepancy in the provided code snippet because `num` is not defined in the initial state. Given the context, it seems likely that `num` should be `n` (the first element of `case['params']`). Assuming this correction, let's proceed with the explanation.

3. **Values of the Variables:**
   - `num` (assumed to be `n`): The first element of `case['params']`.
   - `mod_x`: Calculated as `n % x`.
   - `mod_y`: Calculated as `n % y`.
   - `required_mod_x`: Calculated as \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
   - `required_mod_y`: Calculated as `mod_y`.

Given these definitions, the output will be a formatted string showing the values of these variables.

**Final Output:**
Output: **Number: [n], mod_x: [n % x], mod_y: [n % y], required_mod_x: [(x - (n % x)) % x], required_mod_y: [n % y] (where n, x, and y are the first three elements of case['params'])**
