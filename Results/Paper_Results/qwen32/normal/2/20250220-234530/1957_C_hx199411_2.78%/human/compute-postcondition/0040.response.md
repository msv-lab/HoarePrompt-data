To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the `dp` array is being populated. The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = m`, updating `dp[i]` based on the previous values in the `dp` array using the formula:

\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

From the given output states after the first three iterations, we can see the following:

- After the first iteration (`i = 3`), `dp[3]` is calculated.
- After the second iteration (`i = 4`), `dp[4]` is calculated as 18.
- After the third iteration (`i = 5`), `dp[5]` is calculated as 18.

Let's continue this process until `i = m`.

### Calculation of `dp` values:

We already know:
- `dp[1] = 1`
- `dp[2] = 3`
- `dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = (3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % (10^9 + 7) = 7`
- `dp[4] = 18`
- `dp[5] = 18`

Now let's compute `dp[6]`:
\[ dp[6] = (dp[5] + 5 \times dp[4] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (18 + 5 \times 18 \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (18 + 180) \% (10^9 + 7) = 198 \]

Next, `dp[7]`:
\[ dp[7] = (dp[6] + 6 \times dp[5] \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (198 + 6 \times 18 \times 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (198 + 216) \% (10^9 + 7) = 414 \]

Continuing this pattern, we compute `dp[i]` for all `i` up to `m`.

However, since the problem does not specify the exact value of `m`, we will assume that the loop runs until `i = m`. Given the nature of the problem and the provided outputs, we can infer that the final value of interest is `dp[m]`.

### Final Output State:

Assuming `m` is large enough, the final `dp[m]` will be computed as described. Since the problem asks for the final output state and does not specify a particular `m`, we can generalize that the final state will be:

- `dp[m]` will hold the final computed value after all iterations.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`dp[m]` holds the final computed value after all iterations.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `dp[m]` will contain the final result of the dynamic programming computation, which is the value we are interested in.
