The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates over the range starting from 3 up to `m + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value within this range, and for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `k` is the second integer read from the input, such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`
- `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c` equals `r` in each of the `k` iterations
- `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with specific initial values and updates

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, if `i` was 3 at the start of the previous iteration, it would be 4 at the start of the current iteration. If `i` was 4 at the start of the previous iteration, it would be 5 at the start of the current iteration, and so on.

Assuming `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration (the first iteration of the loop), then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is the second integer read from the input, such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`; `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c` equals `r` in each of the `k` iterations; `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7); `i` is 4**
