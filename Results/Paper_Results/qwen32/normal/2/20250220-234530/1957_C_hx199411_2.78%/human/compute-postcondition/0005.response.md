In the given for loop, the only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0 because `range(k)` generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `k`. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input, such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`.
- `num` is 0.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `k` to be greater than 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `num` do not affect the execution of the loop according to the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` must be greater than 0; `num` is 0**.
