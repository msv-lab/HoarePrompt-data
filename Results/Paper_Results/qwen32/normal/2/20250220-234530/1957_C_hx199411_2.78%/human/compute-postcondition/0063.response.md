The code snippet provided increments the variable `num` by 2. The values of the other variables (`i`, `k`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `num` was not explicitly defined, but after the operation, its new value is its original value plus 2.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `num` is `num + 2`.**
