### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We have an `n x n` chessboard.
- Players alternate turns placing rooks: the human player places white rooks, and the computer places black rooks.
- Rooks cannot attack each other, meaning no two rooks can be in the same row or column.
- The computer mirrors the human player's move unless the move is on the diagonal (`r == c`).
- We need to find the number of distinct final configurations after `k` moves by the human player and the corresponding responses by the computer.

#### Key Observations:
- Moves on the diagonal (`r == c`) do not create a mirrored move by the computer.
- Moves off the diagonal create a mirrored move by the computer.
- Each move effectively reduces the number of available rows and columns by 2 (one for the human player and one for the computer).

#### Solution Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` (size of the board) and `k` (number of moves made by the human player).
   
2. **Counting Moves**:
   - Initialize `num` to 0. This variable counts the effective reduction in the number of available positions due to the moves.
   - For each of the `k` moves, read the coordinates `(c, r)`.
     - If `c == r`, increment `num` by 1 because this move does not create a mirrored move.
     - Otherwise, increment `num` by 2 because this move creates a mirrored move.
   
3. **Calculating Remaining Positions**:
   - Calculate `m = n - num`. This represents the number of positions left on the board after accounting for the `k` moves and their mirrored counterparts.
   
4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - If `m == 0`, there are no more moves possible, so the result is 0.
   - If `m == 1`, there is only one way to place the last rook, so the result is 1.
   - For `m > 1`, use dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks:
     - Initialize a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in `i` positions.
     - Base cases: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
     - For `i >= 3`, compute `dp[i]` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
     - The formula accounts for placing a rook in one of the `i` positions and then recursively solving for the remaining `i-1` positions, considering the mirrored nature of the moves.

5. **Output**:
   - Print the result for each test case.

#### Verification:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic described above. It handles the special cases (`m == 0` and `m == 1`) and uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of configurations for larger values of `m`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

**Correctness:** **True**
