The code snippet increments the variable `num` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `num` was either 1 (if `c` equals `r`) or 2 (if `c` does not equal `r`). After the increment, `num` will be either 2 or 3 respectively.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1; `num` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `c` initially equaled `r` or not.**
