The value of `num` is incremented by 2. Given that `num` was initially 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` was 2, after the increment, `num` will be 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` will be 4.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `num` is 3 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 4, `m` is `n - num`, `c` and `r` are the new integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`.**
