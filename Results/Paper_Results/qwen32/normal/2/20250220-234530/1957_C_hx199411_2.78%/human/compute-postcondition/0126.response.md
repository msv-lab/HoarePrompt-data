Postcondition: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - x` where `x` is the number of times `c == r` during the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and is either 1 or at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to 1, `dp[2]` set to 3, and if `m` is at least 5, `dp[3]` is set to 7, `dp[4]` is set to 25, and `dp[5]` is set to 81, and all `dp[i]` for `i` from 6 to `m` are 0, `i` is 6 if `m` is 1, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`.**
