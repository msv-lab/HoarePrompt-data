The given Python code snippet updates the `dp` list at index `i` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. This means that the value at `dp[i]` is dependent on the previously computed values `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes due to this line of code is `dp[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is the second integer read from the input, such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`; `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on whether `c` equals `r` in each of the `k` iterations; `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3; `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**.
