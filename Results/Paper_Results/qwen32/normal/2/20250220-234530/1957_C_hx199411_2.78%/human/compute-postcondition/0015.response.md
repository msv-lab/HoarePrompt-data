The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given the initial conditions, `num` was either 1 (if `c` equals `r`) or 2 (if `c` does not equal `r`). After incrementing `num` by 2, the new value of `num` will be either 3 (if `c` initially equaled `r`) or 4 (if `c` initially did not equal `r`).

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer read from the input, such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `k` is greater than 0; `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1; `num` is 3 if `c` initially equaled `r`, otherwise `num` is 4; `c` and `r` are updated to the new input values.**
