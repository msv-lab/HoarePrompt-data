Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `num` is `2k - x` where `x` is the number of times `c == r` during the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3, `i` is 6.**

Explanation: The value of `dp[2]` has been updated to 3. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
