Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Unique Elements Extraction:**
   - It creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` from arrays `a` and `b` respectively, ensuring that we only consider unique elements from each array.
   - It then creates sets `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` which contain elements from `unique_a` and `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`. This ensures we only consider elements that could potentially contribute to forming the set of numbers from 1 to `k`.

3. **Set Operations:**
   - `only_a` contains elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.
   - `only_b` contains elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`.
   - `both` contains elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.

4. **Condition Checks:**
   - The program checks if the size of `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`. If true, it means there are more elements in `a` that are not in `b` than can be used to form the required set, so it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - Similarly, it checks if the size of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`. If true, it means there are more elements in `b` that are not in `a` than can be used to form the required set, so it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - Finally, it checks if the total number of distinct elements (`len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`) is less than `k`. If true, it means there aren't enough distinct elements to form the set of numbers from 1 to `k`, so it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it appends 'YES' to the results, indicating that it is possible to form the required set.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included. It efficiently uses set operations to ensure that the conditions are checked accurately.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
