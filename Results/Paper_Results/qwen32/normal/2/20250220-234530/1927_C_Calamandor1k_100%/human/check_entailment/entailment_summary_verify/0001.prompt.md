You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

- Program:
t = int(input())
cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cases.append((n, m, k, a, b))
results = func_1(t, cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
        unique_a = set(a)
        unique_b = set(b)
        relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
        relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
        only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
        only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
        both = relevant_a & relevant_b
        if len(only_a) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        if len(only_b) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
        if total_distinct < k:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        results.append('YES')
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers and some constraints. It determines whether it is possible to select `k` distinct integers from the union of these two lists under specific conditions and returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case indicating the feasibility.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Unique Elements Extraction:**
   - It creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` from arrays `a` and `b` respectively, ensuring that we only consider unique elements from each array.
   - It then creates sets `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` which contain elements from `unique_a` and `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`. This ensures we only consider elements that could potentially contribute to forming the set of numbers from 1 to `k`.

3. **Set Operations:**
   - `only_a` contains elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.
   - `only_b` contains elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`.
   - `both` contains elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.

4. **Condition Checks:**
   - The program checks if the size of `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`. If true, it means there are more elements in `a` that are not in `b` than can be used to form the required set, so it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - Similarly, it checks if the size of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`. If true, it means there are more elements in `b` that are not in `a` than can be used to form the required set, so it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - Finally, it checks if the total number of distinct elements (`len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`) is less than `k`. If true, it means there aren't enough distinct elements to form the set of numbers from 1 to `k`, so it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it appends 'YES' to the results, indicating that it is possible to form the required set.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included. It efficiently uses set operations to ensure that the conditions are checked accurately.

Therefore, the program is correct.
