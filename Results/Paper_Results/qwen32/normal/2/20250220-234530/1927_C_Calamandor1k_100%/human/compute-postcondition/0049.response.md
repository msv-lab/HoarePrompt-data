The given code snippet updates the `both` set by performing an intersection operation between `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. Since both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` are initially empty sets, their intersection will also be an empty set.

Here is the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains 1.
- `cases` remains `[(5, 6, 3, [8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14])]`.
- `n` remains 5.
- `m` remains 6.
- `k` remains 3.
- `a` remains `[8, 9, 10]`.
- `b` remains `[11, 12, 13, 14]`.
- `unique_a` remains `{8, 9, 10}`.
- `unique_b` remains `{11, 12, 13, 14}`.
- `relevant_a` remains `set()`.
- `relevant_b` remains `set()`.
- `only_a` remains `set()`.
- `both` is now `set()`.
- `only_b` remains `set()`.
- `total_distinct` remains 2.
- `results` remains `['YES']`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(5, 6, 3, [8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14])]`, `n` is 5, `m` is 6, `k` is 3, `a` is `[8, 9, 10]`, `b` is `[11, 12, 13, 14]`, `unique_a` is `{8, 9, 10}`, `unique_b` is `{11, 12, 13, 14}`, `relevant_a` is `set()`, `relevant_b` is `set()`, `only_a` is `set()`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `set()`, `total_distinct` is 2, `results` is `['YES']`**.
