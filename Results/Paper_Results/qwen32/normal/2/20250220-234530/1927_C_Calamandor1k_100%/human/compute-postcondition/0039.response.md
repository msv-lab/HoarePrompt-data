The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{1, 2}`, `relevant_b` is `set()`, `only_a` is `{1, 2}`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `set()`, `total_distinct` is 2**
