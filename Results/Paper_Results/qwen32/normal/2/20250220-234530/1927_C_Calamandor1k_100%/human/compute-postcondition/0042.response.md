The only objects in the loop head are the tuple variables `(n, m, k, a, b)` and the iterable `cases`. Since `cases` is already given as a list with one tuple, the loop will not execute again because there are no more elements in `cases` to iterate over.

However, if we were to consider the scenario where `cases` had more tuples, the state would need to be adjusted to reflect the next tuple in the list. Given the current state, since there are no more tuples in `cases`, the loop does not execute again.

But to illustrate how the state would change if there were more tuples, let's assume `cases` had another tuple:

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7]), (5, 6, 3, [8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14])]`, `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{1, 2}`, `relevant_b` is `set()`, `only_a` is `{1, 2}`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `set()`, `total_distinct` is 2, `results` is `['YES']`.

Given this new `cases` list, the next iteration would use the next tuple in the list:

State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(5, 6, 3, [8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14])]`, `n` is 5, `m` is 6, `k` is 3, `a` is `[8, 9, 10]`, `b` is `[11, 12, 13, 14]`, `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{1, 2}`, `relevant_b` is `set()`, `only_a` is `{1, 2}`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `set()`, `total_distinct` is 2, `results` is `['YES']`**

Since the original `cases` list only contains one tuple, the loop does not execute again, and the state remains as it is without further adjustments for the loop head variables.
