The code updates the value of `total_distinct` by calculating the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. Given the initial state, all these sets (`only_a`, `only_b`, `both`) are empty sets, so their lengths are 0. Therefore, `total_distinct` is updated to `0 + 0 + 0`, which is `0`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(5, 6, 3, [8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14])]`, `n` is 5, `m` is 6, `k` is 3, `a` is `[8, 9, 10]`, `b` is `[11, 12, 13, 14]`, `unique_a` is `{8, 9, 10}`, `unique_b` is `{11, 12, 13, 14}`, `relevant_a` is `set()`, `relevant_b` is `set()`, `only_a` is `set()`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `set()`, `total_distinct` is 0. If the length of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`, `results` is `['YES', 'NO']`. Otherwise, `results` remains `['YES']`.**
