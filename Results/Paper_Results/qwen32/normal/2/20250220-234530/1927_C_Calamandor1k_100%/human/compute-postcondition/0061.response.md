To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the output states after the first three iterations. The loop processes each test case independently, and the results are appended to the `results` list based on certain conditions.

Let's break down the provided information:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - Each test case consists of integers `n`, `m`, `k`, lists `a`, and `b`.
   - `results` is an empty list initially.

2. **Loop Code:**
   - For each test case `(n, m, k, a, b)`:
     - Compute `unique_a` and `unique_b` as sets of elements in `a` and `b`, respectively.
     - Filter `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` to include only elements ≤ `k`.
     - Compute `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` as differences and intersections of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
     - Check conditions:
       - If `len(only_a) > k // 2` or `len(only_b) > k // 2`, append `'NO'` to `results`.
       - If `total_distinct < k` (where `total_distinct` is the sum of lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`), append `'NO'` to `results`.
       - Otherwise, append `'YES'` to `results`.

3. **Output States after Iterations:**
   - After 1 iteration: `results` is `['NO']`
   - After 2 iterations: `results` is `['YES']`
   - After 3 iterations: `results` is `['YES', 'NO', 'YES']`

From the above, it is clear that `t` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute three times. Since `t` can be up to 10^4, there could be more test cases beyond these three. However, based on the given information, we will assume `t` is exactly 3 for the sake of determining the final output state.

Given the provided outputs for the first three iterations, the final `results` list after all iterations (assuming `t` is exactly 3) would be `['YES', 'NO', 'YES']`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **['YES', 'NO', 'YES']**

This means that out of the three test cases processed, the first and third test cases met the conditions to append `'YES'` to the `results` list, while the second test case did not meet the conditions and thus appended `'NO'`.
