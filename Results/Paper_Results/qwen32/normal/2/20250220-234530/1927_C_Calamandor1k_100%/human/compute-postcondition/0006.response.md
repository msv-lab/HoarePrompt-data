Given the code snippet `only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b`, we need to determine the new state of the variables after executing this line. 

- `relevant_a` is defined as `{x for x in unique_a if x <= k}`.
- `relevant_b` is defined as `{x for x in {4, 5, 6, 7} if x <= k}`.

Since `k` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact elements of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. However, we can express `only_a` in terms of `k`.

The set difference `only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b` will contain elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `results` is `[]`, `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{x for x in unique_a if x <= k}`, `relevant_b` is `{x for x in {4, 5, 6, 7} if x <= k}`, `only_a` is `{x for x in relevant_a if x not in relevant_b}`**.

In natural language: The variable `only_a` is now a set containing elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`. All other variables retain their initial values.
