The given code snippet creates a new set `relevant_a` that contains elements from `unique_a` which are less than or equal to `k`. However, the variable `k` is not defined in the initial state, which means its value is unknown. As a result, we cannot determine the exact elements that will be included in `relevant_a`.

Given this, the output state will include the newly created set `relevant_a` with elements from `unique_a` that meet the condition `x <= k`, where `k` is an undefined variable.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `results` is `[]`, `unique_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{x for x in unique_a if x <= k}`**
