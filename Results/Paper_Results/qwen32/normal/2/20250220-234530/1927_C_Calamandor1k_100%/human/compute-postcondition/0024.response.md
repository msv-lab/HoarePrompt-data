The code snippet `unique_a = set(a)` assigns a new set to `unique_a` based on the list `a` from the first tuple in the `cases` list. Given the initial state, `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`. Therefore, `unique_a` will be updated to `{1, 2, 3}`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(3, 4, 2, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7])]`, `unique_a` is `{1, 2, 3}`, `unique_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_a` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `relevant_b` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `only_a` is `set()`, `both` is `{4, 5, 6, 7}`, `total_distinct` is `len(only_b) + 4`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES']`**
