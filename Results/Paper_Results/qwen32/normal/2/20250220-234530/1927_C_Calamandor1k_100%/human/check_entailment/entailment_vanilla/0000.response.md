Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `m`, and `k` representing the lengths of arrays `a` and `b`, and the number `k` respectively.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` from arrays `a` and `b` to get unique elements.
   - It filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k` (`relevant_a` and `relevant_b`).
   - It calculates the elements that are unique to `a` (`only_a`), unique to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - It checks if the number of elements unique to `a` (`only_a`) exceeds `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results because we cannot choose more than `k // 2` elements from `a`.
   - It performs the same check for elements unique to `b` (`only_b`).
   - It calculates the total number of distinct elements that can be used (`total_distinct`), which is the sum of elements unique to `a`, unique to `b`, and common to both.
   - If `total_distinct` is less than `k`, it appends 'NO' to the results because we do not have enough distinct elements to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it appends 'YES' to the results.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The logic correctly identifies elements that are unique to each array and those that are common.
- It ensures that no more than `k // 2` elements are chosen from either array.
- It checks if there are enough distinct elements to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included among the chosen elements.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
