Output State: **`t` is 1, `cases` is `[(5, 6, 3, [8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14])]`, `n` is 5, `m` is 6, `k` is 3, `a` is `[8, 9, 10]`, `b` is `[11, 12, 13, 14]`, `unique_a` is `{8, 9, 10}`, `unique_b` is `{11, 12, 13, 14}`, `relevant_a` is `set()`, `relevant_b` is `set()`, `only_a` is `set()`, `both` is `set()`, `only_b` is `set()`, `total_distinct` is 2, `results` is `['YES', 'NO']`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect any variables or their values. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given context, the `continue` statement has no effect, and all variables retain their initial values.
