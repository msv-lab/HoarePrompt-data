Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `cases`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`. The function processes each test case and returns a list of strings, either 'YES' or 'NO', based on the conditions specified for each test case.**
