Output State: **`L` is 75001 or 25001; `R` is 100001 or 50001; `z` is incremented by 1; `x` is 75001 or 25001; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is the second integer read from input; `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `numCuts` is 0; `leftover` holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `L` is updated to the value of `x`, which can be either 75001 or 25001. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
