The code snippet sets `numCuts` to 0. This changes the value of `numCuts` from its previous state (which was less than or equal to `k`) to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains integers representing the connections read from the input, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs`, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0; if `numCuts` equals `k`, then `leftover` is less than `x`.**
