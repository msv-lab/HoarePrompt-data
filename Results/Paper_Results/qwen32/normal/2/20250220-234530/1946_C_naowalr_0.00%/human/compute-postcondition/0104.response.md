The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` includes `a` three times. After appending `a` one more time, `adj[b]` will include `a` four times. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the standard input, `adj[a]` includes `b` three times, `adj[b]` includes `a` four times.**
