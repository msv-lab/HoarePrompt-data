The code snippet assigns the value of `x` to `L`. Therefore, `L` now holds the value of `(L + R) // 2`.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in an undirected graph; `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` is greater than 0; `i` ranges from 0 to `n-2` during the loop's execution; `a` and `b` are pairs of integers read from the input representing edges in the graph; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is `(L + R) // 2`; `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`; If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is either 25001 or 75001; otherwise, `L` is either 1 or 50001 but not both `L` and `R` are 50001; `R` is either 25001 or 75001; `R` must be greater than `L + 1`; `L` is `(L + R) // 2`.**
