Output State: **`z` is equal to `t`, `L` is the final lower bound determined by the last iteration of the loop, `R` is `L + 1`, `n` and `k` are the values read from the last iteration, `adj` is the adjacency list built from the last iteration's input, `numCuts` is the final number of cuts determined by the last iteration of the loop, and `leftover` is the final leftover value determined by the last iteration of the loop.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `z` will be equal to the total number of test cases `t`. The variables `L` and `R` will reflect the final bounds determined by the binary search in the last iteration of the loop. The adjacency list `adj`, the number of vertices `n`, and the integer `k` will correspond to the values from the last test case processed. The variables `numCuts` and `leftover` will hold the final results from the depth-first search (`dfs`) function executed in the last iteration.
