To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the given `for` loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Here's the given loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute, the `range(n - 1)` must produce at least one value, meaning `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2.

Given the initial state:
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists.
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input, and `1 <= k < n`.
- `t` must be greater than 0.

Since `t` is not part of the loop head, it doesn't need adjustment for the loop to execute. The variable `k` also doesn't need adjustment because it's not part of the loop head, although it has constraints that must be satisfied elsewhere in the program.

Thus, the only necessary adjustment is ensuring that `n` is at least 2, so that `n - 1` is at least 1, allowing the loop to execute.

State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
