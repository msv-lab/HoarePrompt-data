The code appends the integer `b` to the list at index `a` in the list `adj`. This means that the list at `adj[a]` now contains `b` as one of its elements.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a]` includes `b`, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
