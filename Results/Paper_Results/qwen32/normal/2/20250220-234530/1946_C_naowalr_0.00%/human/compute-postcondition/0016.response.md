Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in an undirected graph; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `i` ranges from 0 to `n-2` during the loop's execution; `a` and `b` are pairs of integers read from the input representing edges in the graph.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `adj` will represent an adjacency list of an undirected graph with `n` vertices. Each entry `adj[i]` will contain a list of vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `i` will have taken on every value from 0 to `n-2` during the loop's execution.
