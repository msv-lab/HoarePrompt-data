The code snippet calculates the midpoint between `L` and `R` and assigns it to `x`. Given the initial state, `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001. Therefore, `x` will be `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which equals 50001.

Other variables (`adj`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in an undirected graph; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `i` ranges from 0 to `n-2` during the loop's execution; `a` and `b` are pairs of integers read from the input representing edges in the graph; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0; `x` is 50001.**
