The code appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `adj[a]` already includes `b`, appending `b` again results in `b` appearing twice in `adj[a]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from the standard input, `adj[a]` includes `b` twice, `adj[b]` includes `a`**.
