The code appends the value of `b` to the list at index `a` in the dictionary `adj`. Given that `a` and `b` are integers read from the standard input, the list at index `a` in `adj` will now include `b` as one of its elements.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from the standard input, `adj[a]` includes `b`**.
