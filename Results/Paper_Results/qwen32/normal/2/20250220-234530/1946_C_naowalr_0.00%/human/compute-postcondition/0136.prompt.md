You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: adj is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with n vertices, where each sublist contains the vertices adjacent to the corresponding vertex. n is the number of vertices in the tree, and k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for z in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        
        adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        L = 1
        
        R = int(100000.0 + 1)
        
        numCuts = 0
        
        while R - L > 1:
            x = (L + R) // 2
            numCuts = 0
            leftover = dfs(1, 1)
            if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
                L = x
            else:
                R = x
        
        print(L)
        
    #State: `z` is equal to `t`, `L` is the final lower bound determined by the last iteration of the loop, `R` is `L + 1`, `n` and `k` are the values read from the last iteration, `adj` is the adjacency list built from the last iteration's input, `numCuts` is the final number of cuts determined by the last iteration of the loop, and `leftover` is the final leftover value determined by the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `adj`, which is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, and `k`, which is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n. The function returns a value based on the structure of the tree and the integer `k`. Specifically, Case_1: If the tree has certain properties related to `k`, it returns a specific result; Case_2: If the tree does not meet those properties, it returns a different result. However, without additional details on the specific conditions and results, the exact functionality in terms of return values cannot be fully described.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
