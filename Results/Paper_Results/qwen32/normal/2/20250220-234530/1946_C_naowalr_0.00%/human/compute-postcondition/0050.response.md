The code snippet `adj[a].append(b)` modifies the list `adj` by appending the integer `b` to the sublist at index `a`. The other variables (`L`, `R`, `z`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k` and `leftover >= L` is not satisfied, `R` is `L + 1`, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where the sublist at index `a` now includes `b`, `a` and `b` are integers read from input.**
