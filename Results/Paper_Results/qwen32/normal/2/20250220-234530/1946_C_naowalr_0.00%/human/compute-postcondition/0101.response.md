The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from the standard input, `adj[a]` includes `b` twice, `adj[b]` includes `a` three times.**
