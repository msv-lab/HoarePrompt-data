The given code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of `adj`, `n`, `k`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is the second integer read from the input such that `1 <= k < n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
