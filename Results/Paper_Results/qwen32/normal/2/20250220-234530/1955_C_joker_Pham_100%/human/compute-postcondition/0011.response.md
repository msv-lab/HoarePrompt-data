Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` is equal to `r`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing any of the variable values. Thus, the state of all variables remains the same as the initial state, except that the loop or if statement is exited.
