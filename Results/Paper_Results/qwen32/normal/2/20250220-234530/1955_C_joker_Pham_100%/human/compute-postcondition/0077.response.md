Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` and `r` are integers with `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `a[l] <= a[r]`, and `k >= a[l] * 2`, then `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` becomes 0, then `r` is decremented by 1 and `k` is updated to `k - a[l] * 2`. If `k < a[l] * 2`, and `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. In either case, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l] > a[r]`, the code does nothing and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
