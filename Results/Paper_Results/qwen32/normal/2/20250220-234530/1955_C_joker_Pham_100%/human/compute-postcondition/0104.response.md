Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 (unless k has been modified to 0), `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 (except for `a[r]` which has been updated), `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The variable `sunks` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`) retain their initial values and constraints.
