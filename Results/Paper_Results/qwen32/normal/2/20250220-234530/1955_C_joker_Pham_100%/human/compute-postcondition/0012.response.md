Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` and `r` are integers with `l` possibly equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, then `sunks` is set to 1 and we exit the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sunks` remains 0 and we exit the most internal loop or if statement. If `l` is not equal to `r`, no changes are made to `sunks` and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.**
