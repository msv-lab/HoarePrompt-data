Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` and `r` are integers with `l` possibly equal to `r`. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `k` is reduced by `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `a[l]` is set to 0 if it was initially greater than 0, `l` is incremented by 1, and `r` is decremented by 1. If `k` is exactly equal to `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than `a[r] * 2`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged.**
