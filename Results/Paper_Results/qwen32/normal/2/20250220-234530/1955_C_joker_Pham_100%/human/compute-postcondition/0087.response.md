The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables unless they are explicitly modified within the skipped section. In this case, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `sunks`) are being modified by the `continue` statement itself.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 (unless k has been modified to 0), `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]` and each other element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `l` and `r` are integers with `l` must be less than or equal to `r` and `r` is now `r - 1`, `k` is now `k - 2 * a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
