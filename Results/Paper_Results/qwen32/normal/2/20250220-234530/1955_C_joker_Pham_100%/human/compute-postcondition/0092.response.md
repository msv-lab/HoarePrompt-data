Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 (unless k has been modified to 0), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` and `r` are integers with `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`, `r` is now `r - 1`, `k` is now `k - 2 * a[r]`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[r] * 2 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 without modifying `a`, `l`, `r`, or `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
