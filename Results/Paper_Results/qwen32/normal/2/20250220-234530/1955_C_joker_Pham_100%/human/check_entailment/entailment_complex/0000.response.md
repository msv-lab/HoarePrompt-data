### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements and the example provided.

#### Key Points:
1. **Initial Setup**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and the list `a` of ship durabilities.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to determine how many ships will be sunk after `k` attacks by the Kraken.
3. **Logic Inside `func_1`**:
   - **Pointers `l` and `r`**: These pointers represent the first and last ships that haven't sunk yet.
   - **Variable `sunks`**: Keeps track of the number of ships that have sunk.
   - **Loop Condition**: The loop continues until either all ships have sunk (`l > r`) or there are no more attacks left (`k == 0`).
   - **Attacks on Ships**:
     - If the Kraken attacks the first ship (`a[l]`), it checks if there are enough attacks left to sink it. If yes, it subtracts the required attacks from `k`, updates the durability of the last ship, and increments the `sunks` counter.
     - Similarly, if the Kraken attacks the last ship (`a[r]`), it follows the same logic.
     - If the Kraken cannot sink either the first or the last ship with the remaining attacks, it breaks out of the loop.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where there is only one ship left (`l == r`).

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify the function with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n=4`, `k=5`, `a=[1, 2, 4, 3]`
  - Attack 1: First ship (1) -> Sunk, `a=[2, 4, 3]`, `k=4`
  - Attack 2: Last ship (3) -> Durability reduced to 2, `a=[2, 4, 2]`, `k=2`
  - Attack 3: First ship (2) -> Sunk, `a=[4, 2]`, `k=0`
  - Result: 2 ships sunk

- **Test Case 2**: `n=4`, `k=6`, `a=[1, 2, 4, 3]`
  - Attack 1: First ship (1) -> Sunk, `a=[2, 4, 3]`, `k=5`
  - Attack 2: Last ship (3) -> Durability reduced to 2, `a=[2, 4, 2]`, `k=3`
  - Attack 3: First ship (2) -> Sunk, `a=[4, 2]`, `k=1`
  - Attack 4: Last ship (2) -> Sunk, `a=[4]`, `k=-1` (but we stop at 0)
  - Result: 3 ships sunk

The function correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of ships that sink, matching the expected results.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected results for the given examples.

**Correctness: True**
