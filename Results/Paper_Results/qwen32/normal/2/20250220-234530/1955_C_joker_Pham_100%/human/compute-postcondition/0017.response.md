Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k - a[l] * 2 ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `l` and `r` are integers with `l` possibly equal to `r`, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and `sunks` is either 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions. `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and the current value of `a[r]` is 0.**
