Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l]` and each element `a_i` (for i ≠ r) satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `l` is incremented by 1, `r` is an integer with `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is decremented by 1, `k` is now `k - a[l] * 2`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. `sunks` is incremented by 1. The code continues to the next iteration of the loop.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The value of `r` remains unchanged unless `a[r]` is 0, in which case `r` is decremented by 1. The value of `k` is adjusted by subtracting `a[l] * 2` if the conditions are met. The variable `sunks` is incremented by 1. The code then continues to the next iteration of the loop without making further changes to the other variables.
