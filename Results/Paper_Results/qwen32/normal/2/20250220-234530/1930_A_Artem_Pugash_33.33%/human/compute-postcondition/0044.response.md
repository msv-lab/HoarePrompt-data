The code snippet sets `suma` to 0. This means the value of `suma` is now 0, regardless of its previous value. The other variables (`numbers`, `i`, and `numInteger`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order; `suma` is 0; `i` is number of iterations + 1; `numInteger` is input integer.**
