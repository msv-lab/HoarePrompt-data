Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `numCases` is the integer read from the input; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(numCases):
    numInteger = int(input())
    numbers = input().split()
    numbers.sort(reverse=False)
    suma = 0
    while numbers != []:
        a = int(numbers.pop(0))
        b = int(numbers.pop(0))
        suma += min(a, b)
    print(suma)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `numCases` remains greater than 0.
- For each test case, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` remains a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
- `numInteger` remains the same input integer.
- `numbers` becomes an empty list.
- `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of numbers from the original `numbers` list.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: numbers: [], suma: sum of minimums of all pairs, i: number of iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: numbers is [], suma is n1 + n3 + n5, i is number of iterations + 1, numInteger is input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
