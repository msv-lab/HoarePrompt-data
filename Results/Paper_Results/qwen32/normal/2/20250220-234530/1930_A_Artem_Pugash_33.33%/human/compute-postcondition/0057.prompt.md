Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order; `suma` is 0; `i` is number of iterations + 1; `numInteger` is input integer.
Code of the loop:
while numbers != []:
    a = int(numbers.pop(0))
    b = int(numbers.pop(0))
    suma += min(a, b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of strings in ascending order (excluding the first element); `suma` is `min(a, b)`; `i` is number of iterations + 1; `numInteger` is input integer; `a` is equal to `b`; `b` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `numbers` is a sorted list of strings in ascending order (excluding the first two elements that were removed); `suma` is `a + min(a, b)`; `i` is the number of iterations + 1; `numInteger` is input integer; `a` is the integer value of the first element that was initially removed from `numbers`; `b` is the integer value of the second element that was removed from `numbers`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is `2 + min(1, b)`, `i` is the number of iterations + 1, `numInteger` is input integer, `a` is 1, and an `IndexError` would occur because `numbers.pop(0)` is attempted on an empty list.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
