To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This represents the number of test cases.
2. **`numCases`**: Greater than 0. This indicates there are one or more test cases.
3. **For each test case**:
   - **`n`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - **`a`**: A list of \(2n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
4. **`numInteger`**: Remains the same input integer.
5. **`numbers`**: Becomes an empty list.
6. **`suma`**: The sum of the minimum values of each pair of numbers from the original `numbers` list.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(suma)
```

### Explanation:
- The variable `suma` is described as the sum of the minimum values of each pair of numbers from the original `numbers` list.
- However, it is mentioned that `numbers` becomes an empty list. This implies that there are no numbers to form pairs from.
- Therefore, the sum of the minimum values of each pair of numbers from an empty list would logically be 0 because there are no pairs to consider.

### Conclusion:
Given that `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` would be 0 since there are no pairs to evaluate and sum their minimum values.

Output: **0**
