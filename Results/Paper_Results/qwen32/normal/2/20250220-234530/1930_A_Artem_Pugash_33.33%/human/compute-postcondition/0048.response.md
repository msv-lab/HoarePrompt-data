Output State: **`numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of strings in ascending order (excluding the first element); `suma` is `min(a, b)`; `i` is number of iterations + 1; `numInteger` is input integer; `a` is equal to `b`; `b` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `suma` has been updated to be the minimum of `a` and `b`. All other variables retain their initial states.
