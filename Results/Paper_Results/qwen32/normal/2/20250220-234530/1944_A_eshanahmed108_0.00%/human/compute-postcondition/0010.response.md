Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, if `k` is within the valid range of 0 to `n * (n - 1) / 2`, it performs some computation (not detailed here) and returns a result. If `k` is outside this range, it returns an error message indicating that `k` is invalid for the given `n`.**
