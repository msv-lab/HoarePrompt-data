### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges. Initially, all islands are connected, meaning Everule can visit all `n` islands.

Here's the key insight:
- If Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 completely, Everule can only visit island 1.
- To isolate island 1, Dominater needs to destroy all bridges connected to island 1. Since island 1 is connected to `n-1` other islands, Dominater needs to destroy `n-1` bridges to isolate it.
- Therefore, if `k >= n-1`, Everule can only visit island 1.
- If `k < n-1`, Dominater cannot fully isolate island 1, so Everule can still visit all `n` islands.

The given code correctly implements this logic:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```
- It iterates through each test case.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- It checks if `n - k <= 1`. If true, it prints `n` (Everule can visit all islands). Otherwise, it prints `1` (Everule can only visit island 1).

This matches our reasoning perfectly.
