Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer obtained from the input.
- `m` is an integer greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1.
- `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1.
- `_` is 2.
- `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `_`, `a`, `b`, or `s`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is always `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
