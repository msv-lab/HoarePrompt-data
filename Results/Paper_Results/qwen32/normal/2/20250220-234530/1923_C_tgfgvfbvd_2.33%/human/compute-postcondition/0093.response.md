The code appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Since `p` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `p` will contain one element, which is the value of `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element; `p` is a list containing the value of `c`; `c` is `c + x`; `_` is 1.**
