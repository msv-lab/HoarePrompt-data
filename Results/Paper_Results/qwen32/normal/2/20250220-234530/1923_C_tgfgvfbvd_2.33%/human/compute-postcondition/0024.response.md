The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. This output does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The `print` statement is straightforward and directly outputs the specified string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variables and Conditions**: 
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `n` and `m` are integers with `m > 0`.
   - `l` is a list of integers.
   - `p` is a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.
   - `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`.
   - `a` and `b` are integers.
   - `s` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `b` and the list `p`.

2. **Condition for `s`**:
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
   - Otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.

3. **Additional Condition**:
   - Either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)`.

Despite these conditions and calculations, the `print` statement is simply `print('NO')`, which means it will always output the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
