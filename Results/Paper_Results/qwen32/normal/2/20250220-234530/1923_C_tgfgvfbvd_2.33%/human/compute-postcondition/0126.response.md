Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`: The first integer obtained from the input.
- `m`: The second integer obtained from the input, and it must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `l`: A list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `p`: A list containing the cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added.
- `c`: The sum of all elements in `l`.
- `_`: The value 3 (though this variable is not used in the provided print statement).
- `a` and `b`: Two integers obtained from the latest input.
- `s`: Calculated as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`; otherwise, `s` is `p[b - 1]`.

### Code Snippet
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis
The print statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion
Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` without referencing any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, the output is:

Output: **NO**
