Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`n`**: The first integer obtained from the input.
3. **`m`**: The second integer obtained from the input, and it must be greater than or equal to 1.
4. **`l`**: A list of integers obtained from the new input.
5. **`p`**: A list containing the cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added.
6. **`c`**: The sum of all elements in `l`.
7. **`_`**: The value is 3 (though this variable is not used in the provided code snippet).
8. **`a` and `b`**: Two integers obtained from the latest input.
9. **`s`**: 
   - If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
   - Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`.

### Code Snippet
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis
The provided code snippet contains only one line, which is a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. This means that regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `a`, `b`, or `s`, the output of the `print` statement will always be `'YES'`.

### Conclusion
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output
Output: **YES**
