The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as the loop counter. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `m` is the second integer obtained from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums after each element of `l` has been added; `c` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `_` is 3; `a` and `b` are the two integers obtained from the latest input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`. Additionally, if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition holds true; otherwise, the else part does not alter the state further.**
