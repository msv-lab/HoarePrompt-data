Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` is "good". A subarray is considered "good" if:
1. There exists another array `b` of the same length such that the sum of elements in `b` equals the sum of elements in the subarray.
2. Every element in `b` is strictly greater than 0.
3. No element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.

### Key Observations:
- **Condition 1**: The sum of the subarray must be even because we need to split it into two equal parts (the subarray itself and `b`).
- **Condition 2**: Since every element in `b` must be positive, the smallest possible value for each element in `b` is 1. This means the sum of `b` must be at least the length of the subarray.
- **Condition 3**: No element in `b` can be equal to the corresponding element in the subarray. This implies that if the subarray has only one element, it cannot be "good" unless the element is greater than 1 (since `b` would need to have a different value).

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution calculates the prefix sums of the array `c` and uses these to quickly compute the sum of any subarray. It then checks if the sum of the subarray is even and greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Issues in the Solution:
1. **Single Element Subarrays**: The solution does not handle the case where the subarray has only one element correctly. If the subarray has only one element, it should check if the element is greater than 1 to be "good".
2. **Sum Check**: The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` ensures that the sum can be split into two parts and that each part can have values greater than 0. However, it does not guarantee that the two parts can be formed without violating condition 3 (no element in `b` can be equal to the corresponding element in the subarray).

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Single Element Subarrays**: The solution does not account for the fact that a single element subarray can only be "good" if the element is greater than 1. For example, the subarray `[1]` cannot be "good" because there is no positive integer `b_1` such that `b_1 ≠ 1` and `b_1 = 1`.
- **General Case**: The condition `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is necessary but not sufficient to ensure that the subarray can be split into two arrays `a` and `b` that meet all the conditions. For instance, consider the subarray `[2, 2]`. The sum is 4, which is even and satisfies `s >= 2 * 2`. However, there is no way to form `b` such that `b[0] ≠ 2` and `b[1] ≠ 2` while still having `b[0] + b[1] = 4`.

### Conclusion:
The solution does not correctly handle all cases, particularly single-element subarrays and does not fully ensure that condition 3 is satisfied. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
