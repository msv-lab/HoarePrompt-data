The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which iterates over the elements in the list `l`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how `x` changes and what other variables might be affected based on the loop head.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the first integer obtained from the input
- `m` is the second integer obtained from the input
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element
- `p` is a list containing the value of `c` and the new value of `c` which is `c + x + x`
- `c` is `c + x + x`
- `_` is 1
- `x` is the next element in the list `l`

Since the loop iterates over each element in `l`, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in the list `l`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, and `_`) remain unchanged except for `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `m` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` and the new value of `c` which is `c + x + x`, `c` is `c + x + x`, `_` is 1, `x` is the next element in the list `l`**.

However, since `x` is the next element in the list `l`, we need to specify that `x` is now the subsequent element after the current `x`. Let's denote the current `x` as `x_current` and the next `x` as `x_next`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `m` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` and the new value of `c` which is `c + x_current + x_current`, `c` is `c + x_current + x_current`, `_` is 1, `x` is `x_next` where `x_next` is the next element in the list `l` after `x_current`**. 

To simplify, we can just say:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `m` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` and the new value of `c` which is `c + x + x`, `c` is `c + x + x`, `_` is 1, `x` is the next element in the list `l`**.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `m` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must contain at least one element, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` and the new value of `c` which is `c + x + x`, `c` is `c + x + x`, `_` is 1, `x` is the next element in the list `l`**.
