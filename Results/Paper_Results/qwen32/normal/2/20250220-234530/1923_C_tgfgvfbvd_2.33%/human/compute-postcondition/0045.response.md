The code snippet provided updates the list `l` by reading a new list of integers from the input. This means the previous contents of `l` are replaced with the new input values. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and since `p` and `c` are dependent on the original `l`, they also remain unchanged until recalculated. The variable `_` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input where `m` must be greater than 0; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in the original `l`; `c` is the sum of all elements in the original `l`; `_` is 1.**
