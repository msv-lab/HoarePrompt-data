The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state does not specify any values for `n` and `m`, so these will be set based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.**
