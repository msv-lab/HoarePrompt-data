The code snippet assigns two integers obtained from the input to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `_`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` is an integer greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1; `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1; `_` is 1; `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.**
