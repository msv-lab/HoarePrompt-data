### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify whether it correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. Let's break down the problem and the program step-by-step.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Good Array Definition**:
   - An array `a` of length `m` is considered "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
     - The sum of elements in `a` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
     - No element in `a` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.
   
2. **Subarray Check**:
   - Given an array `c` of length `n`, for each query defined by indices `l_i` and `r_i`, we need to check if the subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` (inclusive) is "good".

3. **Conditions for "Good" Subarray**:
   - The sum of the subarray should be at least twice the number of elements in the subarray.
   - The subarray must contain more than one element.

#### Program Analysis:
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
  - The program calculates prefix sums of the array `c` and stores them in list `p`. This allows efficient calculation of the sum of any subarray using the formula:
    \[
    \text{sum}(c[l_i:r_i]) = p[r_i - 1] - p[l_i - 2]
    \]
    where `p[l_i - 2]` is used only if `l_i > 1`.

- **Query Processing**:
  - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sums.
  - It checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the number of elements in the subarray and if the subarray contains more than one element.
  - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Verification:
- **Condition 1**: The sum of the subarray should be at least twice the number of elements.
  - This condition ensures that it is possible to construct an array `b` where each element is different from the corresponding element in `a` and all elements in `b` are positive.
  
- **Condition 2**: The subarray must contain more than one element.
  - This condition ensures that the subarray can be split into two different values, which is necessary for constructing the array `b`.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
