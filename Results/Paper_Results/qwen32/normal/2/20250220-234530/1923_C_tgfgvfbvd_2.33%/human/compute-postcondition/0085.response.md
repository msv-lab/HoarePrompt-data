Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer obtained from the input; `m` is an integer greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1; `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1; `_` is `m`. For each iteration, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`; otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`. The loop has executed `m` times, and for each iteration, it checks if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`. If both conditions hold, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `_` will be equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has run the specified number of times. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution. For each iteration, the loop processes the input values `a` and `b`, calculates `s` based on the conditions provided, and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray defined by `a` and `b`.
