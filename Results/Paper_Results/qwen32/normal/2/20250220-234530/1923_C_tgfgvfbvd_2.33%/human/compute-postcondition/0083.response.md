Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, let's break down the situation:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer obtained from the input.
- `m` is an integer greater than 0.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums starting from 1.
- `c` is the total sum of all elements in `l` plus 1.
- `_` is 3.
- `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains `p[b - 1]`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
