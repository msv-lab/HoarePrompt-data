You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])
            cost += right - left + 1
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
    return cost



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a list of strings where each string s consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string s satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in sChar does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: `sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies 2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the total length of all strings in `sChar` does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar`.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: left is len(s), right is len(s), cost is the accumulated cost from all swaps.
    return cost
    #The program returns the accumulated cost from all swaps.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of binary strings (`sChar`) as input and returns the accumulated cost associated with swapping '0's and '1's to achieve a certain configuration within the combined string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the allowed cyclic shifts. Let's analyze why this is the case.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Swapping Elements**: The code attempts to swap elements directly when it finds a '0' to the right of a '1', but this does not account for the actual cost of performing a cyclic shift on the substring that includes these elements. It simply adds `right - left + 1` to the cost without ensuring that the substring is correctly shifted.
   
2. **Lack of Proper Substring Handling**: The code does not handle the cyclic shifting of substrings properly. It only swaps elements and calculates the cost based on their positions, which is not equivalent to performing a cyclic shift on the substring.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The code does not handle certain edge cases correctly. For example, consider the string "11000". The code might incorrectly calculate the cost by swapping elements directly rather than performing the necessary cyclic shifts.

### Counterexample:
Let's take the string "11000" as an example. The optimal way to sort this string would involve multiple cyclic shifts, but the provided code might not perform these shifts correctly.

- **Optimal Steps**:
  1. Choose substring [1, 3]: "11000" -> "01100" (Cost: 3)
  2. Choose substring [2, 4]: "01100" -> "00110" (Cost: 3)
  3. Choose substring [3, 5]: "00110" -> "00011" (Cost: 3)

Total cost: 9

- **Code Behavior**:
  The code might incorrectly swap elements directly, leading to an incorrect cost calculation.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, it is incorrect.
