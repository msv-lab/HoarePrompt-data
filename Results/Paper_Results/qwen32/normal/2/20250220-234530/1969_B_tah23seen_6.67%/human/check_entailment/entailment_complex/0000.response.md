### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the binary string and swapping '0's and '1's when necessary to minimize the cost of sorting the string. However, there are several issues with the logic that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Swapping Logic**: The program swaps '0's and '1's whenever it encounters a '0' to the right of a '1', but it does not guarantee that this will result in the minimum cost to sort the string. The cost calculation `right - left + 1` is applied every time a swap is made, but this does not necessarily reflect the minimum cost required to sort the string.

2. **Inefficient Handling of Substrings**: The program does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts on substrings to minimize the cost. It only considers swapping individual '0's and '1's, which is not sufficient to handle all possible cases efficiently.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle edge cases where the string is already sorted or nearly sorted optimally. For example, if the string is already sorted in non-descending order, the cost should be 0, but the program might still perform unnecessary operations.

4. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**: The loop conditions and the way `left` and `right` are updated do not ensure that all possible swaps are considered. The loops might terminate prematurely or incorrectly, leading to an incomplete or incorrect solution.

### Conclusion:

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the allowed operations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
