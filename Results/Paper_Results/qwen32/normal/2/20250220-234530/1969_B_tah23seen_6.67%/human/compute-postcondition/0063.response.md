To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head: `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`.

Given the current state:
- `right` is `len(s)`
- `left` is 5
- `len(s)` must be greater than 4
- `s[4]` must not be '1'

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. **Condition `left < len(s)`**: 
   - Currently, `left` is 5. For the loop to execute again, `left` must be less than `len(s)`. Since `len(s)` must be greater than 4, the smallest possible value for `len(s)` is 5. However, if `len(s)` is exactly 5, then `left` (which is 5) would not satisfy `left < len(s)`. Therefore, `len(s)` must be greater than 5.

2. **Condition `s[left] != '1'`**:
   - Currently, `left` is 5. For the loop to execute again, `s[5]` must not be '1'. We don't have any information about the value of `s[5]` from the given state, so we need to ensure that `s[5]` is not '1'.

Combining these conditions, we need to adjust the state such that:
- `len(s)` must be greater than 5.
- `s[5]` must not be '1'.

No other states need to be adjusted as per the requirements.

Therefore, the modified state is:
State: **`right` is `len(s)`, `left` is 5, `len(s)` must be greater than 5, and `s[5]` must not be '1'**
