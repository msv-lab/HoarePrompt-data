To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```
while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `right < len(s)`
2. `s[right] != '0'`

Given the state right before the loop:
- `right` is `len(s) - 1`
- `left` is `3`

Let's analyze each condition:

### Condition 1: `right < len(s)`
- Since `right` is `len(s) - 1`, this condition will always be false because `len(s) - 1` is the last index of the string `s`, and thus not less than `len(s)`.

To make this condition true, `right` must be less than `len(s) - 1`. For example, we could set `right` to `len(s) - 2`.

### Condition 2: `s[right] != '0'`
- This condition requires that the character at index `right` in the string `s` is not '0'.

Since we are adjusting `right` to `len(s) - 2` to satisfy the first condition, we need to ensure that `s[len(s) - 2] != '0'`. If `s[len(s) - 2]` is already not '0', then no further adjustment is needed for this condition.

### Adjusted State
To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust `right` to `len(s) - 2` (or any valid index less than `len(s) - 1`) and ensure that `s[right]` is not '0'. 

State: **`right` is `len(s) - 2`, `left` is `3`, and `s[len(s) - 2]` is not '0'**
