Postcondition: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar`; `left` is 0; `right` is 1. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `cost` is 2; otherwise, `cost` remains 0.**
