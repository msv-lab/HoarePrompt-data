To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to ensure that the conditions in the loop head are satisfied:

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
```

Let's break down the conditions:
1. `left <= right`
2. `right < len(s)`
3. `left < len(s)`

Given the initial state:
- `sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar`.
- `left` is 0.
- `cost` is 0.
- `right` is 1.

### Analysis of Conditions:
1. **`left <= right`**: 
   - Given `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, this condition is already satisfied.

2. **`right < len(s)`**: 
   - Since `s` contains all the elements of `sChar`, and each string in `sChar` has at least 2 characters, the minimum length of `s` is 2. Given `right` is 1, this condition is satisfied as long as `s` has at least 2 elements.

3. **`left < len(s)`**: 
   - Similar to the previous condition, since `left` is 0, this condition is satisfied as long as `s` has at least 1 element.

### Conclusion:
Since the initial values of `left` and `right` are 0 and 1 respectively, and given that `s` must contain at least 2 elements (as per the constraints on `sChar`), all conditions in the loop head are already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

### Final State:
State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar`; `left` is 0; `cost` is 0; `right` is 1**.
