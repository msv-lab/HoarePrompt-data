The given code snippet increments the `cost` variable by the value of `right - left + 1`. Given the initial state, `left` is 0 and `right` is 1. Therefore, the calculation for `cost` is `1 - 0 + 1`, which equals 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar`; `left` is 0; `cost` is 2; `right` is 1; `s[right]` is '1' and `s[left]` is '0'.**
