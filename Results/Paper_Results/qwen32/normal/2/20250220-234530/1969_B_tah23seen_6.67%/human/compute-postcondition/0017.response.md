Output State: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar` with `s[1]` being '1'; `left` is 0; `right` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
