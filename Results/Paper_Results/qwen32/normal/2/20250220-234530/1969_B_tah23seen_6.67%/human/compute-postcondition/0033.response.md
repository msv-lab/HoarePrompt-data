Postcondition: **`sChar` is a list of strings where each string consists of only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string satisfies \(2 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 2 \times 10^5\). `s` is a list that contains all the elements of `sChar`. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', the elements at `left` and `right` indices in `s` are swapped, `left` remains the index of the first '1' in `s` before the swap, `right` is `len(s) - 1`, and `cost` is increased by `right - left + 1`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged, `left` is the index of the first '1' in `s`, and `right` is `len(s) - 1`.**
