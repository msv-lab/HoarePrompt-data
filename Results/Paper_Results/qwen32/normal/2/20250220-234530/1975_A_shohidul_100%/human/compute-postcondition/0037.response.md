Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t > 0`: This indicates that `t` is a positive number.
- `n > 1`: This indicates that `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers: This means `a` contains a sequence of integer values.
- `check_all` is False: This is a boolean variable set to False.
- `i` is 3: This is an integer variable with the value 3.
- `new` is a list containing elements from index 3 to the end of `a`: This means `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3.
- `check_all_new` is True if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`; otherwise, `check_all_new` is False: This is a boolean variable determined by comparing the first element of `a` with all elements in `new`.
- `new_all` is True if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element in `new`; otherwise, `new_all` is False: This is a boolean variable determined by checking if the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because it explicitly prints the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
