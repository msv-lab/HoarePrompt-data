The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` is an input integer. However, the value of `n` is not used in the given code snippet. The variable `a` is newly introduced and populated with the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
