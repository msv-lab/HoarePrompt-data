Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, regardless of the values of these variables, the output will always be the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
