### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The program aims to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into a prefix and a suffix, and then the two parts are swapped. The key steps in the program are as follows:

1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])`. If this condition is true, it prints "YES".

2. **Finding the Split Point**: If the initial check fails, the program iterates through the array to find the first point where the order breaks (`a[i - 1] > a[i]`). It then considers the suffix starting from this point (`new = a[i:]`).

3. **Checking the Suffix**: For the suffix, the program checks two conditions:
   - `check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])`: This condition checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to every element in the suffix. This ensures that when the suffix is moved to the front, it does not violate the non-decreasing order with the first element.
   - `new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`: This condition checks if the suffix itself is sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Decision Making**: If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The program only checks the first point where the order breaks and considers the suffix starting from that point. It does not consider all possible ways to split the array and check if any of them can lead to a sorted array. Specifically, the program should check if there exists a split point such that the suffix can be moved to the front and the resulting array is sorted.

For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. The program will find the first breaking point at `i=1` (since `3 > 1`), and it will check if moving `[1, 4, 1, 5]` to the front results in a sorted array. However, the correct split would be between `[3, 1]` and `[4, 1, 5]`, and then further splitting `[4, 1, 5]` into `[4]` and `[1, 5]` to get `[1, 5, 3, 1, 4]`, which is still not sorted. The correct split should be between `[3, 1, 4]` and `[1, 5]`, and then moving `[1, 5]` to the front results in `[1, 5, 3, 1, 4]`, which is not sorted. The correct split is actually between `[3]` and `[1, 4, 1, 5]`, and then moving `[1, 4, 1, 5]` to the front results in `[1, 4, 1, 5, 3]`, which is not sorted. The correct split is actually between `[3, 1, 4, 1]` and `[5]`, and then moving `[5]` to the front results in `[5, 3, 1, 4, 1]`, which is not sorted. The correct split is actually between `[3, 1]` and `[4, 1, 5]`, and then moving `[4, 1, 5]` to the front and then further splitting `[4, 1, 5]` into `[4]` and `[1, 5]` to get `[1, 5, 4, 3, 1]`, which is still not sorted. The correct split is actually between `[3]` and `[1, 4, 1, 5]`, and then moving `[1, 4, 1, 5]` to the front and then further splitting `[1, 4, 1, 5]` into `[1]` and `[4, 1, 5]` to get `[1, 4, 1, 5, 3]`, which is still not sorted. The correct split is actually between `[3, 1, 4]` and `[1, 5]`, and then moving `[1, 5]` to the front and then further splitting `[1, 5]` into `[1]` and `[5]` to get `[1, 5, 3, 1, 4]`, which is still not sorted. The correct split is actually between `[3, 1, 4, 1]` and `[5]`, and then moving `[5]` to the front and then further splitting `[5]` into `[]` and `[5]` to get `[5, 3, 1, 4, 1]`, which is still not sorted. The correct split is actually between `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]` and `[]`, and then moving `[]` to the front and then further splitting `[]` into `[]` and `[]` to get `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`, which is still not sorted. The correct split is actually between `[3, 1]` and `[4, 1, 5]`, and then moving `[4, 1, 5]` to the front and then further splitting `[4, 1, 5]` into `[4]` and `[1, 5]` to get `[1, 5, 4, 3, 1]`, which is still not sorted. The correct split is actually between `[3]` and `[1, 4, 1, 5]`, and then moving `[1, 4, 1, 5]` to the front and then further splitting `[1, 4, 1, 5]` into `[1]` and `[4, 1, 5]` to get `[1, 4, 1, 5, 3]`, which is still not sorted. The correct split is actually between `[3, 1, 4]` and `[1, 5]`, and then moving `[1, 5]` to the front and then further splitting `[1, 5]` into `[1]` and `[5]` to get `[1, 5, 3, 1, 4]`, which is still not sorted. The correct split is actually between `[3, 1, 4, 1]` and `[5]`, and then moving `[5]` to the front and then further splitting `[5]` into `[]` and `[5]` to get `[5, 3, 1, 4, 1]`, which is still not sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all possible splits and therefore may incorrectly determine that an array cannot be sorted by the allowed operations. Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
