Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t > 0`: This indicates that `t` is a positive number.
   - `n > 1`: This indicates that `n` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`.
   - `check_all_new` is a boolean indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

### Analysis:

- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`.
- The value `'NO'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`) described in the initial state.
- Therefore, regardless of the values of these variables, the output of the `print` statement will always be `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:

The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
