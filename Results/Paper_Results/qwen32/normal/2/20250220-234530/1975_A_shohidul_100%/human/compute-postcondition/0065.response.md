Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end of `a`.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `new`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The provided code snippet is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
