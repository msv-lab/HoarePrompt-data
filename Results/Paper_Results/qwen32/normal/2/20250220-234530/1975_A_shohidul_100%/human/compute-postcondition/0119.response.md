Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all_new` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether `check_all_new and new_all` is true or false.**
