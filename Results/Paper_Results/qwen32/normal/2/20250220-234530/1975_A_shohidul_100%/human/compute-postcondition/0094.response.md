Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `check_all` is `False`.
- `i` is an index where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end.
- `check_all_new` is `True` because `a[0] >= new[j]` for all `j` in the range of `len(new)`.
- `new_all` is `True` because `new` is non-decreasing.
- Both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`.

The print statement in the code is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **YES**
