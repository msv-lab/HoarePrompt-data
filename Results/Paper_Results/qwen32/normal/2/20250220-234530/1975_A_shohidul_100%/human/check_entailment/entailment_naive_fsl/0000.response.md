Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases where the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. Let's analyze the code and provide a counterexample.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Sorted Order**: The code checks if the entire array is already sorted, and if not, it attempts to find a valid split point. However, the logic for checking the validity of the split point is flawed.
2. **Inadequate Handling of Multiple Splits**: The code only checks the first split point where `a[i-1] > a[i]` and then breaks out of the loop. This means it doesn't consider other possible splits that might lead to a sorted array.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
2 3 1 4 5
```

#### Expected Output:
```
Yes
```

#### Explanation:
The array `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]` can be split into `[2, 3]` and `[1, 4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`, which is still not sorted. However, another valid split is `[2, 3, 1]` and `[4, 5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[4, 5, 2, 3, 1]`, which is still not sorted. Another valid split is `[2, 3, 1, 4]` and `[5]`. Swapping these parts results in `[5, 2, 3, 1, 4]`, which is still not sorted. Another valid split is `[2]` and `[3, 1, 4, 5]`.
