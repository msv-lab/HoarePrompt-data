The code snippet provided only reassigns the value of `n` based on user input. It does not affect the other variables (`t`, `a`, `check_all`). Since `n` is reassigned, its new value will be the integer input by the user.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.**
