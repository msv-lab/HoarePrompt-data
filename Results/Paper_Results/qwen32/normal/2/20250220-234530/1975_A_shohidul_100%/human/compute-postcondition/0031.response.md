To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers
- `check_all` is False
- `i` is 2

Since the loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`, and at the end of the previous iteration `i` was 2, the next value of `i` should be 3 for the loop to continue executing.

The variable `n` does not change within the loop head, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `i` is 3**
