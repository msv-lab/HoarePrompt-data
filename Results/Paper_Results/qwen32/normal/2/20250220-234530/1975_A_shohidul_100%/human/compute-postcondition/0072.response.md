The code snippet creates a new list `new` which contains all elements of the list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the creation of `new`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `i` is `i + 1`; `new` is a list containing elements of `a` from index `i` to the end.**
