Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `check_all` is False, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all_new` is True, `new_all` is True, indicating that all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]` and all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged except that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
