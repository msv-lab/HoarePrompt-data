Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `i` is 3. If `a[2] > a[3]`, then `new` is a list containing elements from index 3 to the end of `a`. If `check_all_new` is True and `new_all` is True, the program continues without breaking out of the loop. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
