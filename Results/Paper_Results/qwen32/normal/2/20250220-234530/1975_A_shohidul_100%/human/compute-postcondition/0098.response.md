Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is an index where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end, either `check_all_new` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
