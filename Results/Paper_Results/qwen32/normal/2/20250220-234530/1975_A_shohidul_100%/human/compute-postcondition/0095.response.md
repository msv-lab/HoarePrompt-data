Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is `False`, `i` is an index where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end, `check_all_new` is `True` because `a[0] >= new[j]` for all `j` in the range of `len(new)`, `new_all` is `True` because `new` is non-decreasing, and both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are `True`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of the variables remain unchanged, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
