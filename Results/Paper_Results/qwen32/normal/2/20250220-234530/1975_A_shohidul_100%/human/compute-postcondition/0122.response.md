Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `check_all` is `True` if `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `check_all` is `False`. If `check_all` is `True`, the program may perform certain actions (not specified in the if part). If `check_all` is `False`, the loop completes all iterations without printing 'YES'.**
