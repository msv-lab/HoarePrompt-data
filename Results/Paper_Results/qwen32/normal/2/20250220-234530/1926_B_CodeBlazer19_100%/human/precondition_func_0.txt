t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the grid is an n × n list of strings, where each string consists of n characters that are either '0' or '1'; the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid; the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1').
