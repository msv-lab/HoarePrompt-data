Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t`: This is the initial input integer, with a constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i`: This is set to 2.
- `n`: This is another initial input integer.
- `a`: This is set to 0 because "the last string `s` did not have exactly one '1'".
- `b`: This is set to 'SQUARE' if any string `s` had more than one '1', otherwise it is an empty string.
- `j`: This is the initial input integer.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `b` is the only one being printed.
- According to the initial state, `b` is determined based on whether any string `s` had more than one '1'.
- Since no specific strings `s` are provided in the initial state, we can infer that the condition "any string `s` had more than one '1'" is not met.
- Therefore, `b` is an empty string.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `b`, which is an empty string.

Output: **(an empty string)**
