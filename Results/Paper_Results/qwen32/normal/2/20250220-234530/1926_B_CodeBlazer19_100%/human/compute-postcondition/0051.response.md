The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `n` must remain greater than 0 and should be such that `j < n` holds true for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string provided by user input, `j` is 2. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'TRIANGLE' and `b` is ''. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'SQUARE'. If `s` does not contain any '1's, then `a` remains unchanged and `b` is ''**
