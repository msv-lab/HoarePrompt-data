The code snippet assigns the string `'TRIANGLE'` to the variable `a`. None of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is `'TRIANGLE'`, `b` is `''`, `s` is the user's input, and `s` contains exactly one '1'.**
