Postcondition: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a new string provided by user input, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' or 0 based on the original `s`, `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s.count('1') > 1`, 'SQUARE' if `s.count('1') == 1`, or an empty string if `s.count('1') == 0`, and `j` is 1.**
