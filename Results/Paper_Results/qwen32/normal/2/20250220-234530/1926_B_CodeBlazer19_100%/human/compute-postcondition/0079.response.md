The code snippet assigns the string `'SQUARE'` to the variable `b`. This means that regardless of the previous value of `b`, it is now set to `'SQUARE'`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 3.
- `s` remains the new user's input.
- `a` remains set based on the new `s`: if `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is `'TRIANGLE'` and `b` is `''`; if `s` contains more than one '1', `a` is `0` and `b` is `'SQUARE'`; if `s` does not contain any '1', `a` is `0` and `b` is `''`.
- `b` is now `'SQUARE'`.
- `j` remains 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); `i` is 2; `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `s` is the new user's input; `a` is set based on the new `s`: if `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is `'TRIANGLE'` and `b` is `''`; if `s` contains more than one '1', `a` is `0` and `b` is `'SQUARE'`; if `s` does not contain any '1', `a` is `0` and `b` is `''`; `b` is `'SQUARE'`; `j` is 3.**
