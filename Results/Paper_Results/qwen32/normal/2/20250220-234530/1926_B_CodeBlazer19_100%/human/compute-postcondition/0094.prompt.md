Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the `grid` is an n × n list of strings, where each string consists of n characters that are either '0' or '1'; the `grid` contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid; the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1').
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 0
    b = ''
    for j in range(n):
        s = input()
        if s.count('1') == 1:
            a = 'TRIANGLE'
        elif s.count('1') > 1:
            b = 'SQUARE'
    if a != 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if at least one input string `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if at least one input string `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string, and `j` is `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer provided by user input (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if the last string `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise it retains its previous value, `b` is 'SQUARE' if any string `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise it is '', and `j` is `n-1`. If `a` is not equal to 0, then `a` retains its value as 'TRIANGLE' if the last string `s` contains exactly one '1'. If `a` is equal to 0, then `a` is not 'TRIANGLE'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is the initial input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), i is 2, n is the initial input integer, a is 'TRIANGLE' if the last string s had exactly one '1' else 0, b is 'SQUARE' if any string s had more than one '1' else '', j is the initial input integer. Specifically, if the last string s had exactly one '1', then a is 'TRIANGLE'; otherwise, a is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
