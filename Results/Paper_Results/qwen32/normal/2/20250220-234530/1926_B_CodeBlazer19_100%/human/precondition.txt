t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and the grid is an n × n matrix consisting of characters '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that consists of all the '1's, and the size of the shape is greater than 1.
