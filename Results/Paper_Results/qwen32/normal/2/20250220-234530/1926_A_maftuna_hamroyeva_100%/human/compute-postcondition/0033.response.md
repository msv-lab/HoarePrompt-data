The value of `h` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `l` is 0; `h` is 1; `j` is not equal to 'A'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 1; `a` is a non-empty string; `l` is 0; `h` is 1; `j` is not equal to 'A'**.
