Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input between 1 and 32, inclusive; for each of the `t` test cases, there is a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All `t` strings are distinct.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a = input()
    l = 0
    h = 0
    for j in a:
        if j == 'A':
            l += 1
        else:
            h += 1
    if l > h:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 0; `a` is the input string; `l` is the total count of 'A's in `a`; `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not 'A'. If `l` is greater than `h`, then `l` is indeed greater than `h`. Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; i is 1; a is the input string; l is the total number of 'A's in a; h is the total number of non-'A' characters in a; if l is greater than h, then l is indeed greater than h; otherwise, l is less than or equal to h.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 2; `a` is the input string; `l` is the number of 'A's in the string `a`; `h` is the number of characters in the string `a` that are not 'A'. If `l` is greater than `h`, then `l` is indeed greater than `h`. Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
