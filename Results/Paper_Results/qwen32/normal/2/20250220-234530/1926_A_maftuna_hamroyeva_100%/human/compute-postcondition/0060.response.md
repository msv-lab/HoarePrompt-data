The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, if `j` is 'A', `l` was initially 1 and now becomes 2. If `j` is not 'A', `l` was initially 0 and now becomes 1. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `h` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive; `i` is 2; `a` is a non-empty string; `j` is the next character in the string `a`; if `j` is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 0; otherwise, `l` is 1 and `h` is 1.**
