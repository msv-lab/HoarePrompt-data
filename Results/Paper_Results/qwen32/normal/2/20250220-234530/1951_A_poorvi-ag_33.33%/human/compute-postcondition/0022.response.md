The code appends the string `'no'` to the `results` list. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. If `arr` initially contained exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` would have been `['no', 'no']` before the append operation, and after the operation, it becomes `['no', 'no', 'no']`. Otherwise, `results` gains one additional element `'no'`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the new string input from the user, and `results` is a list containing `'no'` appended to its previous contents.**
