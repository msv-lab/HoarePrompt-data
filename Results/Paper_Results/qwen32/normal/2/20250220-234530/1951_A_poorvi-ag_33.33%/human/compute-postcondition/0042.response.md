The only variable in the loop head is `r`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list and the current value of `r`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `r` is the `(t+1)`th element in `results`, and `i` is equal to `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `r` should be the next element in the `results` list, which would be the `(t+2)`th element.

Since `i` is equal to `t` after the loop, we need to consider how `i` relates to the loop iterations. However, `i` is not part of the loop head in this case, so it doesn't need to be adjusted directly. The key is to ensure that `r` correctly points to the next element in the `results` list.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an integer representing the number of iterations; `i` is equal to `t` after the loop; `results` is a list with at least `t+2` elements; `r` is the `(t+2)`th element in `results`**
