Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, and `arr` is the new string input from the user. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` contains either two strings `'no', 'no'` or three strings `'no', 'no', 'yes'` depending on whether the `if` condition was true and an additional `'yes'` was appended. Otherwise, `results` contains one additional element `'yes'` if the `if` condition was true, or one additional string `'no'` if the `else` part was executed.**
