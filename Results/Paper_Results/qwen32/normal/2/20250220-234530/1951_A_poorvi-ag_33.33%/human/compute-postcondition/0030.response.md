The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This means that regardless of the initial contents of `results`, it will now contain one more element `'no'`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the new string input from the user, and `results` contains either two additional elements `'yes', 'no'` or `'no', 'no'` or four strings `'no', 'no', 'yes', 'no'` if `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring.**
