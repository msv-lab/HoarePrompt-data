In this case, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `t`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `t`.

Given the initial state where `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is an input integer, and `results` is an empty list, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0** 

Note: The value of `i` is set to 0 as it is the starting point of the loop when it begins executing. However, since the question asks for the state before the loop starts, the value of `i` is not strictly necessary to specify, but it is often included for clarity.
