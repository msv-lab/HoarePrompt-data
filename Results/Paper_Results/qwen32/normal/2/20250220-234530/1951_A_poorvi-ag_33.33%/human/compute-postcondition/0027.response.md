The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `results`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, and `arr` is the new string input from the user. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, `results` contains either two strings `'no', 'no'` or three strings `'no', 'no', 'yes'` depending on whether the `if` condition was true and an additional `'yes'` was appended. Otherwise, `results` contains one additional element `'yes'` if the `if` condition was true, or one additional string `'no'` if the `else` part was executed.**
