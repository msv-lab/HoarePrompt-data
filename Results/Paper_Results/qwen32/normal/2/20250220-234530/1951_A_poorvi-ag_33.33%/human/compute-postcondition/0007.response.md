Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is the string input from the user. If `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, then `results` is a list containing the string `'no'`. Otherwise, `results` remains an empty list.**
