Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is the string input from the user. The number of '1's in `arr` is exactly 2, and '11' is a substring of `arr`. `results` is a list containing the strings `'no', 'no'`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`, which initially contained only one element `'no'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
