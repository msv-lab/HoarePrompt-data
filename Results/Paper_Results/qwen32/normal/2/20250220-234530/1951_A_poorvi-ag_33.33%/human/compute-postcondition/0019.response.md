The code snippet `arr = input()` changes the value of `arr` to whatever string the user inputs. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the new string input from the user, and `results` is a list containing the string `'no'` if `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, a list containing the string `'yes'` if the number of '1's in `arr` is even and `arr` does not contain exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring, or a list containing the string `'no'` if the number of '1's in `arr` is odd.**
