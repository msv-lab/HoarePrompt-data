The code snippet provided is simply an input statement that reassigns the variable `arr` to a new string input from the user. This means that the previous value of `arr` is discarded, and `arr` now holds the new string input.

Here's the updated state of the variables after executing the code:

- `start` and `end` remain integers such that `start <= end`.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `arr` is now the new string input from the user.
- `results` remains unchanged as per the given conditions.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the new string input from the user, and `results` contains either one additional element `'yes'` or `'no'` based on the `if` condition, or two strings `'no', 'no'` or three strings `'no', 'no', 'yes'` if `arr` contains exactly two '1's with '11' as a substring.**
