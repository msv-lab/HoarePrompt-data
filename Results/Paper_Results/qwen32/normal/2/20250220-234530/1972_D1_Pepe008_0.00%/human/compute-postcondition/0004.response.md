The provided code snippet includes nested loops and a conditional print statement. However, the variables `t` and `T` are not used within the given code block. The variables `a` and `b` are used in the loops, and the code prints pairs `(i, j)` that satisfy a specific condition.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `T` must be greater than 0
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`

The code does not modify `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, or `b`. It only prints certain pairs `(i, j)` based on the condition `int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0`.

Since the code does not change the values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, or `b`, and only prints certain pairs, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the printed output.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`. The code prints pairs (i, j) that satisfy the condition `int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0` for 1 ≤ i ≤ a and 4 ≤ j ≤ b.**
