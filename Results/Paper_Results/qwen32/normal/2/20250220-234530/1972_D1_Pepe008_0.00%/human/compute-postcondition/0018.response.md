Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `T` is greater than 0; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is greater than `i`; if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, `suma` is the previous `suma` plus `x` where `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\). Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged.**
