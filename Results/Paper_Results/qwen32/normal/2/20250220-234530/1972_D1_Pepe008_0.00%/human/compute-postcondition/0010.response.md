Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `T` is greater than 0; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1; `suma` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\) if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0\); `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\) if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0\). If `a - i * (i - 1) <= 0`, `suma` and `x` remain unchanged.**
