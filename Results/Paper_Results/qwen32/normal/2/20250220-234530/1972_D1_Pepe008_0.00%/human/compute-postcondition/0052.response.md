Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`.

Code Snippet:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

The code calculates the value of `x` based on the current values of `a` and `i`. Since the value of `a` is not specified, we will keep it as `a` in our output state.

Impact of the code:
- The value of `x` is calculated using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
- The values of `b` and `i` remain unchanged unless they are part of the calculation for `x`, which they are not in this case.

Output State: **`b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
The value of `x` is computed based on the formula provided, using the current values of `a` and `i`. The values of `b` and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
