The given code snippet reassigns the values of `a` and `b` using the same expressions they were initially assigned from `info`. Since these variables already hold the integer values of `info[0]` and `info[1]` respectively, the reassignment does not change their values.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state for `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is \(t + 1\), `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is the accumulated sum of \(x\) for each iteration where \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\)**.
