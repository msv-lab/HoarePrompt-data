The given code snippet modifies the variable `suma` by adding the value of `x` to it. The values of `b`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified in the code.

Here's the breakdown:
- `b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 (no change).
- `i` is `i + 2` (no change, as the increment operation is not performed in the given snippet).
- `x` is `(a - i)` (no change, as `x` is not recalculated).
- `suma` is updated to `suma + x`.

Given these points, the output state will reflect the updated value of `suma`.

Output State: **`b` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is `(a - i)`, `suma` is `suma + (a - i)`**.
