Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `T` is greater than 0; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is greater than 0; `suma` is the previous `suma` plus the newly calculated `x` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`; `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\) if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, otherwise `x` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1.**
