The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `T` is greater than 0.

At the start of the next iteration, `t` should be incremented by 1 so that the loop can continue executing as long as `t` is less than `T`.

State: **`t` is \(t + 1\), `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`, `suma` is the accumulated sum of \(x\) for each iteration where \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\)**
