### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Game Analysis:
1. **Game Mechanics Recap:**
   - Players alternate turns.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - They then remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob can mirror Alice's moves and ensure he always has a move until Alice is forced into a losing position.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice can mirror Bob's moves and ensure she always has a move until Bob is forced into a losing position.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The winner can be determined by checking the parity of `abs(a - b)`.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob wins.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice wins.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then checks the parity of `abs(a - b)` and prints "Bob" if the difference is even, and "Alice" if the difference is odd.

#### Annotations:
The annotations confirm that the program correctly reads the input values, calculates the absolute difference, checks its parity, and prints the correct winner for each test case.

#### Validation:
The original assessment correctly identifies the winning strategy based on the parity of `abs(a - b)`. The provided program accurately implements this logic. The annotations support this conclusion by showing the correct flow and state of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis and validation, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines the winner for each test case based on the given rules.

Final: **True**
