The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means the previous values of `a` and `b` are overwritten by the new values read from the input. The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 1000; `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input; the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd; `i` is incremented by 1.**
