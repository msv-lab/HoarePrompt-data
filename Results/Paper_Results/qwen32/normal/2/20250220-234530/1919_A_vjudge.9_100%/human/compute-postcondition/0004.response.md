Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 1000.
  - `a` and `b` are two integers read from the input.
  - The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even.

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  print('Bob')
  ```

From the code snippet, it is clear that the `print` statement outputs the string `'Bob'`. The value of `t`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the output of this particular `print` statement because the statement does not reference these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
