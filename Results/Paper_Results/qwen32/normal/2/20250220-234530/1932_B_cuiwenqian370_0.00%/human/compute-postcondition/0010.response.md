To determine the output state, we need to consider the effect of the line `results.append(func_1(path))`. This line calls a function `func_1` with the argument `path` and appends the result to the `results` list.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `path` is `'a_3'`
- `results` is an empty list `[]`

After executing the line, `results` will no longer be empty; it will contain one element, which is the return value of `func_1('a_3')`.

Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we cannot determine the specific value that gets appended to `results`. However, we can denote the return value of `func_1('a_3')` as `func_1('a_3')`.

Thus, the updated state of `results` will be `[func_1('a_3')]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path` is `'a_3'`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']; `t` must be greater than 0; `index` is 3; `results` is `[func_1('a_3')]`; `n` is the integer value of `a_2`.**
