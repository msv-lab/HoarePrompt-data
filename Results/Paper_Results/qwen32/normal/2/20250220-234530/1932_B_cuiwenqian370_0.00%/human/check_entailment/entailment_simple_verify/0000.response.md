### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues systematically using the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine the year when the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur.
- Each sign occurs periodically every `a_i` years.
- Signs must occur sequentially, meaning the (i+1)-th sign can only occur after the i-th sign has occurred.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - This function takes a string `path` and processes it based on the presence of characters '@' and '*'.
  - It uses dynamic programming to calculate some value based on these characters, but this logic is entirely unrelated to the problem of determining the year of the n-th sign's occurrence.
  
- **Function `func_2`:**
  - Reads input from standard input.
  - Assumes that the input is a single string split into components.
  - Calls `func_1` with parts of this string, treating them as paths, which is incorrect.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that `func_1` is interpreting the input as a sequence of characters ('@' and '*') and applying a dynamic programming approach to count occurrences while avoiding certain characters.
- There is no mention of handling periodic events or calculating the year of sign occurrences.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Misinterpretation of Input:**
   - The code reads the entire input as a single string and splits it into components without correctly parsing test cases.
   - It treats the input values as a path of characters rather than periods of sign occurrences.

2. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to handle a different problem involving counting specific characters in a sequence.
   - It does not implement any mechanism to calculate the year of sign occurrences based on their periodicity.

3. **Lack of Periodicity Handling:**
   - The code does not include any logic to iterate through the signs, calculate their next occurrence based on periodicity, and update the current year accordingly.

#### Example Validation:
Given the example input:
```
1
3
2 3 5
```
- The correct output should be `10` because:
  - The first sign occurs in year 2.
  - The second sign can occur in year 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, etc., but the earliest after year 2 is year 3.
  - The third sign can occur in year 5, 10, 15, etc., but the earliest after year 3 is year 5.
  - The third sign can occur again in year 10, which is the earliest possible year for all three signs to have occurred sequentially.

However, the provided code would not produce this result due to its incorrect interpretation and logic.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not solve the problem as described and contains significant logical errors.

**Final: False**
