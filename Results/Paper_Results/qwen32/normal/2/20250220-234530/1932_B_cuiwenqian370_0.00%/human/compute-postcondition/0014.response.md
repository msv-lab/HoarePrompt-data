The code snippet `path = data[index]` updates the value of `path` to the element at index `4` in the list `data`. Given that `index` is `4`, `path` will be updated to `data[4]`. Since `data` is a list of strings starting from `'a_1'` to `'a_n'`, `data[4]` corresponds to `'a_5'`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`path` is `'a_5'`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']; `t` must be greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`; `index` is 4; `results` is `[func_1('a_3')]`; `n` is the integer value of `a_2`.**
