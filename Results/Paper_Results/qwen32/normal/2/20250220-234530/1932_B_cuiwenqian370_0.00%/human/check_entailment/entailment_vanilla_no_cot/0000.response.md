Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be related to some kind of dynamic programming problem involving paths with '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the Chaya tribe's signs of the apocalypse.

The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The solution should iterate through each test case, calculate the occurrence year for each sign sequentially, and print the year of the n-th sign's occurrence.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_apocalypse_year(n, periods):
    current_year = 0
    for period in periods:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year
        current_year = ((current_year // period) + 1) * period
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periods = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(n, periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program reads the input, processes each test case, calculates the year of the n-th sign's occurrence using the `find_apocalypse_year` function, and prints the results.
