Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem requires determining the year in which the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs at regular intervals and must occur sequentially. The provided code, however, seems to be solving a different problem related to a sequence of '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the given problem.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function appears to be designed to process a sequence of '@' and '*' characters and calculate some kind of score based on these characters. It does not handle the periodicity of the signs or their sequential occurrence as required by the problem.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input, but it incorrectly processes the input data. It treats the input as a sequence of '@' and '*' characters rather than as a list of integers representing the periodicity of the signs. Additionally, it calls `func_1` with this incorrect interpretation of the input.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should:
- For each test case, read the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities.
- Initialize the current year to 0.
- For each sign, find the next occurrence of that sign starting from the current year and update the current year to this occurrence year plus one.
- Output the year when the nth sign occurs.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import sys

def find_apocalypse_year(n, periods):
    current_year = 0
    for period in periods:
        # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current year
        next_occurrence = ((current_year + period - 1) // period) * period
        current_year = next_occurrence + 1
    return current_year - 1  # Subtract 1 because we added 1 after the last occurrence

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periods = list(map(int, data[index:index+n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(n, periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected code reads the input correctly, calculates the year of the nth sign's occurrence, and outputs the result for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
