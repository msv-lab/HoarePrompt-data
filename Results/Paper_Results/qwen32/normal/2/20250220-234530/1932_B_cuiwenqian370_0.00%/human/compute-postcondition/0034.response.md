To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state of the `dp` list.

The `dp` list is constructed based on the `path` list as follows:
- `dp[0]` is set to 1 if `path[0]` is '@', otherwise it's `-inf`.
- `dp[1]` is set to `-inf` if `path[0]` is '*' or `path[1]` is '*', otherwise it's 2 if `path[1]` is '@' or 1 if `path[1]` is '*'.
- For each `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `dp[i]` is set to `-inf` if `path[i]` is '*', otherwise it's `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + 1` if `path[i]` is '@' or `max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2])` if `path[i]` is '*'.

The Python code snippet then returns the maximum value in the `dp` list that is greater than `-inf`.

Given the construction rules, the maximum value in the `dp` list will be the highest value that can be achieved based on the sequence of '@' and '*' in the `path` list. This value represents the longest path of '@' symbols considering the constraints imposed by '*'.

Therefore, the output state will be the maximum value found in the `dp` list that is not `-inf`.

Output State: **The program returns the maximum value in the `dp` list that is greater than `-inf`.**
