Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. However, the provided code appears to be solving a different problem related to counting certain patterns in a string, which is unrelated to the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Misinterpretation of Input**: The problem specifies that the input consists of multiple test cases, each with a number of signs `n` followed by their respective periodicities. However, the provided code reads the input as a single string and interprets it incorrectly. It treats the entire sequence of numbers as a single "path" rather than separate test cases.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_1` seems to be designed to count occurrences of a specific character ('@') in a string while avoiding another character ('*'). This logic has no relation to finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on periodicity.

3. **Lack of Periodicity Handling**: The core logic required to solve the problem involves iterating through each sign, calculating the next occurrence based on its periodicity, and updating the current year accordingly. This is completely absent in the provided code.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example input:
```
1
3
2 3 5
```
The correct output should be `10`, as the signs occur in the years 2, 5, and 10 respectively. However, the provided code would not produce this result due to its incorrect interpretation and logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
