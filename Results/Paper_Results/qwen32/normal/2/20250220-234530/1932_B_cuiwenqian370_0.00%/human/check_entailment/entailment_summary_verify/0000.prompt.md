You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if path[0] == '@':
        dp[0] = 1
    elif path[0] == '*':
        dp[0] = -float('inf')
    if n > 1:
        if path[1] == '*':
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
    return max((x for x in dp if x > -float('inf')))

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        path = data[index]
        index += 1
        results.append(func_1(path))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` followed by a string `path` containing `n` space-separated integers. For each test case, it processes the `path` using `func_1` and prints the result.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. However, the provided code appears to be solving a different problem related to counting certain patterns in a string, which is unrelated to the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Misinterpretation of Input**: The problem specifies that the input consists of multiple test cases, each with a number of signs `n` followed by their respective periodicities. However, the provided code reads the input as a single string and interprets it incorrectly. It treats the entire sequence of numbers as a single "path" rather than separate test cases.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_1` seems to be designed to count occurrences of a specific character ('@') in a string while avoiding another character ('*'). This logic has no relation to finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on periodicity.

3. **Lack of Periodicity Handling**: The core logic required to solve the problem involves iterating through each sign, calculating the next occurrence based on its periodicity, and updating the current year accordingly. This is completely absent in the provided code.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example input:
```
1
3
2 3 5
```
The correct output should be `10`, as the signs occur in the years 2, 5, and 10 respectively. However, the provided code would not produce this result due to its incorrect interpretation and logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
