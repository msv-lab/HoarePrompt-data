The code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the output state includes the previously defined variables with their unchanged values, along with the newly introduced `results` list.

Output State: **`path` is a string representing space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
