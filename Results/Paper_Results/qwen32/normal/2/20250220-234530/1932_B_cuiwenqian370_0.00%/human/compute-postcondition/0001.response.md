The code reads from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the input into a list of strings, where each string represents one of the space-separated integers originally in `path`. 

Given that `path` was initially a string of space-separated integers, after the execution of `data = input().split()`, `data` will be a list of these integers as strings.

Output State: **`path` is a string representing space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings ['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']**
