Let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states step-by-step to understand how the loop behaves and what the final state should be.

### Initial State Recap
- `path`: `'a_{1+2*t}'`
- `input`: `sys.stdin.read`
- `data`: `['a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`
- `t`: `int(data[0])`
- `index`: `1 + 2*t`
- `results`: `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_5'), ..., func_1('a_{1+2*(t-1)})]`

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over `results`, which contains elements generated by `func_1` applied to specific indices of `data`. The indices are determined by `1 + 2*i` where `i` ranges from `1` to `t-1`.

### Given Output States
1. **After 1 iteration**:
   - `results`: `[func_1('a_3')]`
2. **After 2 iterations**:
   - `results`: `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_4')]`
3. **After 3 iterations**:
   - `results`: `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_4')]`

There seems to be a discrepancy in the third output state since it should be `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_5')]` if `t` is `3`. However, based on the pattern observed in the first two states, we'll assume the correct `results` for `t=3` should be `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_5')]`.

### Correcting the Pattern
If `t` is `3`, then `results` should be `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_5')]`. This means the loop will iterate exactly twice for `t=3`.

### Generalizing for Any `t`
For any `t`, the loop will iterate `t-1` times because `results` contains `t-1` elements.

### Final Output State
Assuming `t` is `3` (as inferred from the given states), the loop will iterate twice. After the loop completes, the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the printed outputs.

### Conclusion
Since the loop does not modify any of the variables `path`, `input`, `data`, `t`, or `index`, only the printed outputs change. The final state of the variables will be the same as the initial state with the exception of the printed results.

Output State: **`path` is `'a_{1+2*t}'`, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `data` is a list of strings `['1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n']`, `t` is `1`, `index` is `3`, `results` is `[func_1('a_3'), func_1('a_5')]`.**

In natural language, the final state is identical to the initial state except that the loop has printed the results of `func_1('a_3')` and `func_1('a_5')`.
