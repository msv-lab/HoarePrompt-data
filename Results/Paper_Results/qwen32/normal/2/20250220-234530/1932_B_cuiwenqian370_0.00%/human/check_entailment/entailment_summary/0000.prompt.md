Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

# Functions with Execution Summary:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if path[0] == '@':
        dp[0] = 1
    elif path[0] == '*':
        dp[0] = -float('inf')
    if n > 1:
        if path[1] == '*':
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
    return max((x for x in dp if x > -float('inf')))
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` takes a list of characters `path` where each character is either '@' or '*'. It returns 0 if the list is empty. Otherwise, it calculates a score based on the sequence of characters, where '@' contributes positively to the score and '*' results in a score of negative infinity for that position. The function returns the highest possible score from the sequence, ignoring any positions with a score of negative infinity.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        path = data[index]
        index += 1
        results.append(func_1(path))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` followed by a string `path` containing `n` space-separated integers. For each test case, it processes the `path` using `func_1` and prints the result.
