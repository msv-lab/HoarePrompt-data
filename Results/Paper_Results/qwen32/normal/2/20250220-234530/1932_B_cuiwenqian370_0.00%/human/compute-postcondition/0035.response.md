Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`, which is a list of characters where each character can be either '@' or '*'. The function returns 0 if a certain condition is met (which is not detailed here). Otherwise, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` list that is greater than `-inf`.**
