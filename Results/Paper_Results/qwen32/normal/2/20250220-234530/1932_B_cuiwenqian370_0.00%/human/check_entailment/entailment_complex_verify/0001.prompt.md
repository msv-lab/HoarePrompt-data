You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of characters `path` where each character is either '@' or '*'. It returns 0 if the list is empty. Otherwise, it calculates a score based on the sequence of characters, where '@' contributes positively to the score and '*' results in a score of negative infinity for that position. The function returns the highest possible score from the sequence, ignoring any positions with a score of negative infinity.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` followed by a string `path` containing `n` space-separated integers. For each test case, it processes the `path` using `func_1` and prints the result.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning: 

The given problem requires us to determine the year in which the nth sign will occur, considering that each subsequent sign can only occur after the previous one. The program provided does not address this problem at all. Instead, it seems to be solving a different problem related to counting '@' symbols in a string while avoiding '*' symbols, which is unrelated to the described problem.

Let's break down the provided code:

1. **func_1(path)**: This function appears to process a string `path` and counts occurrences of '@' symbols while avoiding '*' symbols. It uses dynamic programming to achieve this. However, this logic is entirely unrelated to the problem of determining the year in which the nth sign will occur based on their periodicities.

2. **func_2()**: This function reads input from standard input, parses it into test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case. It then prints the results. Since `func_1` is not relevant to the problem, `func_2` also does not solve the intended problem.

Given the mismatch between the problem description and the provided code, it is clear that the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
