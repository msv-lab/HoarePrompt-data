Reasoning:  
The provided code does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the year in which the nth sign occurs sequentially based on their periodicities. However, the given functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) appear to be solving a different problem related to scoring sequences of '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the described problem.

To correctly solve the problem, we need a function that iterates through each sign's periodicity, keeping track of the current year and finding the next occurrence of each subsequent sign after the previous one. The provided functions do not perform this calculation.

Thus, the given program is incorrect for the problem at hand.

Correctness: **False**
