The given code snippet updates the values of `n` and `m` based on the user input. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are already defined integers within certain ranges, but these values are overwritten by the new input values.

Here's the impact of the code:
- `n` and `m` are reassigned to the values provided by the user input, which are split into two integers.

Given the constraints, the new values of `n` and `m` will still satisfy their respective ranges (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 5), but their specific values will be those input by the user.

The variable `t` and the string `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'**.
