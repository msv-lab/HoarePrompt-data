The code snippet `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by `m`. Given the initial state, `ans` is either `m` (if 'D' is not a key in `hmp`) or `0` (if 'D' is a key in `hmp`). After executing `ans += m`, `ans` will be `m` if 'D' was not a key in `hmp`, or `m` if 'D' was a key in `hmp` (since `0 + m` equals `m`).

Therefore, regardless of the initial value of `ans`, after the operation, `ans` will be equal to `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 5; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'; `s` is a string input by the user; `p` is 'ABCDEF'; `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each character in `s`; `i` is 'D'; `ans` is `m`.**
