The code snippet provided assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `s`. This means `s` will hold whatever string value is input by the user. The values of `n`, `m`, `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` is a calculated value, `t` is greater than 0, `s` is an input string**.
