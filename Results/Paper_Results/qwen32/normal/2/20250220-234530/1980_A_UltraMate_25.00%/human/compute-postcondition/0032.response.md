In the given task, the loop head contains only the variable `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and `t` controls the number of iterations. Since `_` does not influence the continuation of the loop, we only need to consider adjusting `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have decremented `t` by 1 (assuming it follows the typical behavior of Python's `range`). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only thing we need to adjust is `t` to ensure the loop can run one more time.

State: **k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m), t is greater than 0**
