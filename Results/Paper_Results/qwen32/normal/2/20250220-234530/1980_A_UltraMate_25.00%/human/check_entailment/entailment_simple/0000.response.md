### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it correctly computes the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of rounds, respectively.
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n` which represents the difficulty levels of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Existing Problems:**
   - A `Counter` object `hmp` is created from the string `s`. This counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the bank.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - The variable `p` is initialized to the string `'ABCDEF'`, representing the required difficulty levels for each round.
   - For each difficulty level `i` in `p`:
     - If `i` is not present in `hmp`, it means there are no problems of that difficulty level in the bank. Therefore, Vlad needs to create `m` new problems of that difficulty level, and this value is added to `ans`.
   - For each difficulty level `i` that exists in `hmp`:
     - If the count of `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`, it means there are not enough problems of that difficulty level to cover all `m` rounds. Therefore, Vlad needs to create `m - hmp[i]` additional problems of that difficulty level, and this value is added to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all required difficulty levels for a test case, the program prints the total number of additional problems needed (`ans`).

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10 1 BGECDCBDED`
  - `hmp` will be `{'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
  - Required difficulties: `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']`
  - Missing difficulties: `['A', 'F']`
  - For each missing difficulty, Vlad needs to create 1 problem (since `m=1`), so `ans = 2`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `10 2 BGECDCBDED`
  - `hmp` will be `{'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
  - Required difficulties: `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']`
  - Missing difficulties: `['A', 'F']`
  - For each missing difficulty, Vlad needs to create 2 problems (since `m=2`), so `ans = 4`.
  - Additionally, `C` and `D` have only 1 problem each, so Vlad needs to create 1 more problem for each, adding `2` more to `ans`.
  - Total `ans = 6`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `9 1 BBCDEFFGG`
  - `hmp` will be `{'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 2, 'G': 2}`
  - Required difficulties: `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']`
  - Missing difficulties: `['A']`
  - For the missing difficulty, Vlad needs to create 1 problem (since `m=1`), so `ans = 1`.

The program seems to be correctly calculating the number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the given logic.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
