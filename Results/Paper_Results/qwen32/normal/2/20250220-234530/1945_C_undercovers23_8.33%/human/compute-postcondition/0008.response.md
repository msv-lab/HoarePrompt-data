Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`. If `n` is even, `pk` is calculated as `n // 2`. If `n` is odd, `pk` is also calculated as `n // 2`.**
