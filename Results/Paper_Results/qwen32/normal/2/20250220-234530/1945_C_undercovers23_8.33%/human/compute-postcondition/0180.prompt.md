Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t - 2`, `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `s` is the new string input by the user, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`, `mini` is `100000000`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is [], `i` is `n - 2`. If `len(final) == 0`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is a sorted list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, `final` is a sorted list containing `[n]`. The value of `n % 2` does not affect the final values of the variables as both branches of the if-else statement perform the same operations.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2; If the character at index `i` of the string `s` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1; `zero_perc` is the ceiling of `(zero * 100) / (i + 1)`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` now includes `i + 1` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1. `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` includes `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `one` is incremented by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` includes the value `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
