The only variable in the loop head is `ele`, which iterates over the elements of the list `lst`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `ele` and how it changes as the loop progresses.

Given:
- `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50% and has at least one element.
- `i` is `n - 2` (though `i` is not used in the loop head, it is part of the provided state).

At the end of the previous iteration, `ele` would have taken on the value of the last element processed from `lst`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ele` should take on the next value in `lst`.

Let's denote the current value of `ele` as `lst[j]` where `j` is the current index in `lst`. After processing `lst[j]`, the next value of `ele` should be `lst[j + 1]`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact current value of `ele` or the position in `lst`, we can assume that `ele` has just finished processing `lst[j]` and is about to process `lst[j + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `ele` is now `lst[j + 1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user such that there exists at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `mini` is the minimum of 100000000 and `abs(pk - ele)`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50% and has at least one element; `i` is `n - 2`; `ele` is `lst[j + 1]`**
