The given code snippet increments the variable `zero` by 1. This affects the value of `zero` directly. Since `zero` is incremented, the new value of `zero` will be its previous value plus one. No other variables are modified by this single line of code.

Given that `zero` is initially set to 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and 0 if `s[i]` is '1', after executing `zero += 1`, the new value of `zero` will be either 2 (if it was 1) or 1 (if it was 0).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is at least 50 and `one_perc` is at least 50, otherwise `lst` remains empty; `mini` is 100000000; `zero` is `zero + 1`; `one` is 0 if `s[i]` is '0' and 1 if `s[i]` is '1'; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`; `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`; `i` is incremented by 1**
