To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables evolve through each iteration and what their final values will be once the loop completes.

### Key Variables and Their Evolution:
- **`zero`**: Counts the number of '0's encountered so far.
- **`one`**: Counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
- **`zero_perc`**: Percentage of '0's encountered so far, rounded up.
- **`one_perc`**: Percentage of remaining '1's, rounded up.
- **`lst`**: List of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%.

### Loop Iteration Details:
The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`. In each iteration:
- We increment `zero` if `s[i]` is '0'.
- We increment `one` if `s[i]` is '1'.
- We compute `zero_perc` as the ceiling of `(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.
- We compute `one_perc` as the ceiling of `((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
- If both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50, we append `i + 1` to `lst`.

### Final State Analysis:
After the loop completes:
- `zero` will be equal to the total number of '0's in the string `s`.
- `one` will be equal to the total number of '1's in the string `s`.
- `lst` will contain all indices where the percentages of '0's and remaining '1's are both at least 50%.
- `i` will be `n - 2` (since the loop runs until `i = n - 2`).

### Output State:
Given the above analysis, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `mini` is 100000000; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%; `i` is `n - 2`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `zero` will hold the total number of '0's in the string, `one` will hold the total number of '1's, and `lst` will contain all positions where the percentage of '0's seen so far and the percentage of remaining '1's are both at least 50%. The variable `i` will be `n - 2`, reflecting the last index processed by the loop.
