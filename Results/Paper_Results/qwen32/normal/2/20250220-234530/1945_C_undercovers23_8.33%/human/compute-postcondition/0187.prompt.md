Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the new string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `mini` is `100000000`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` contains indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50; `i` is `n - 2`.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the new string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `mini` is `min(100000000, abs(pk - ele))`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` contains at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50; `i` is `n - 2`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the new string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `mini` is `min(100000000, abs(pk - ele), min(mini, abs(pk - ele)))`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` contains at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50; `i` is `n - 2`; `ele` is the next element in `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the new string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - ele))`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` contains at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50; `i` is `n - 2`; `ele` is the next element in `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
