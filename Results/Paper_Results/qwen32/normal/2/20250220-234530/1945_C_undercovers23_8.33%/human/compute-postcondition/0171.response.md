Postcondition: **`n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `one` is incremented by 1. `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` includes `i + 1`.**
