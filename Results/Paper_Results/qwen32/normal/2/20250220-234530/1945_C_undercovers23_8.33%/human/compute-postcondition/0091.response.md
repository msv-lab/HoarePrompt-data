Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the new string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the original string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the original string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the original string `s`; `mini` is `100000000`; `zero` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', otherwise `zero` is 0; `one` is 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '1', otherwise `one` is 0; `lst` is []; `i` is `n - 2`; `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)); `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.**

Explanation: The variable `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of the percentage of '1's excluding the character at index `i` in the string `s`. All other variables retain their initial values.
