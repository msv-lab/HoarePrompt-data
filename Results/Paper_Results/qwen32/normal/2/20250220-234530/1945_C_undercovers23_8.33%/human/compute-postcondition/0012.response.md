The code snippet initializes two new variables, `zero` and `one`, both set to 0. This does not affect the values of any existing variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`). 

Therefore, the Output State remains the same for all other variables except for the newly introduced `zero` and `one`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0.**
