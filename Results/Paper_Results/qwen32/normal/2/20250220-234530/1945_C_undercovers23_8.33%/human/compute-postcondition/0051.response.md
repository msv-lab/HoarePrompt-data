To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for elem in lst:
    # the loop body is omit
```

This means we can only adjust the state of `elem` and `lst`.

### Analysis:

1. **`lst`**: This is the list over which the loop iterates. For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element. According to the problem statement, `lst` is defined as "a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50% and has at least one element." Therefore, `lst` already satisfies the condition of having at least one element.

2. **`elem`**: This variable represents each element in `lst` during each iteration of the loop. Since `lst` contains at least one element, `elem` will be initialized to the first element of `lst` when the loop starts.

### Conclusion:

Given that `lst` is guaranteed to have at least one element, no further adjustments are needed for `lst` or `elem`. The existing state already ensures that the loop can execute.

### Final State:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user and is at least 2; `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'; `s` is the string input by the user such that there exists at least one index where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%; `pk` is `n // 2`; `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`; `o` is the count of '1's in the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0's in the string `s`; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(pk - ele)` for all `ele` in `lst`; `zero` is the total count of '0's in `s`; `one` is the total count of '1's in `s`; `lst` is a list of indices where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50% and has at least one element; `i` is `n - 2`; `final` is an empty list**.
