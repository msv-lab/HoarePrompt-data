Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the new state.

Initial State:
- `n` is the remainder of `n` divided by `1`. Since any number modulo 1 is 0, `n` is 0.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\) and `n` is not equal to `k`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. This condition seems contradictory because `n` is 0, so `k` must be greater than 0 and not equal to 0, meaning \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`. Substituting `n` as 0, `costs` becomes `[0 - k + 1, 1]` which simplifies to `[1 - k, 1]`.
- `h` is `h + curr`. Since the initial value of `h` is not specified, we'll denote it as `h_initial`. So, `h` is `h_initial + curr`.
- `curr` is `n`, which is 0.
- `i` is `1`.

Code Snippet:
```python
h += curr
```

Impact of the Code:
- `h` is incremented by the value of `curr`. Since `curr` is 0, `h` remains unchanged from its initial value of `h_initial + curr`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is 0; `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\); `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`; `h` is `h_initial + curr`; `curr` is 0; `i` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is:
- `n` remains 0.
- `k` remains a positive integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- `costs` remains `[1 - k, 1]`.
- `h` remains `h_initial + curr` (which is `h_initial` since `curr` is 0).
- `curr` remains 0.
- `i` remains 1.
