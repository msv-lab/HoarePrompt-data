### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. Alice has `n` coins.
2. Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
3. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls.
4. Each stall can have a price per jewel set by Bob.
5. Alice buys greedily: she buys as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then moves to the next stall, and so on.
6. Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `n == k`, the code correctly outputs "YES" with one stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.
   - If `n < k`, the code correctly outputs "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels with fewer than `k` coins.

2. **General Case**:
   - The code initializes a list `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy at each stall (`curr = n // i`) and subtracting the total cost from `n`.
   - It checks if the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is at least `k`. If so, it outputs "YES" with the costs; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

#### Issues in the Code:
- The logic for determining the costs and the number of jewels bought is flawed.
- The code only considers two fixed costs (`n - k + 1` and `1`), which is insufficient to guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
- There is no mechanism to ensure that the total number of stalls does not exceed 60.
- The approach does not account for the possibility of using different prices to achieve the exact number of jewels.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, Bob should strategically set up the stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One way to achieve this is to use a binary representation approach, where each stall corresponds to a power of 2, allowing Bob to control the number of jewels Alice buys precisely.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
