The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It prints 'YES' and additional information if `n` can be reduced to 0 by subtracting multiples of `k` or `n-k+1` a total of at least `k` times. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
