You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice has `n` coins.
- Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls.
- Each stall can have a price per jewel between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- Alice buys greedily: she buys as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then moves to the next stall, and so on.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (coins Alice has) and `k` (jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel, and returns.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.
   - Otherwise, it initializes a list `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall using the formula `curr = n // i` and adjusts `n` accordingly.
   - If the total number of jewels Alice can buy (`h`) is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the prices of the stalls.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for determining the prices and the number of stalls is flawed.
- The program only considers two stalls with fixed prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`), which is insufficient to guarantee that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels in all cases.
- The program does not ensure that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.
- The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when `k` is very large compared to `n`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, Bob needs to strategically set up the stalls and their prices. One effective strategy is to use powers of 2, which allows Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels without exceeding the 60-stall limit.

Here’s a corrected version of the approach:
- Use binary representation of `k` to determine the number of stalls and their prices.
- Each stall corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `k`.
- Set the price of each stall to a power of 2 corresponding to the position of the bit.
- Ensure the total number of stalls does not exceed 60.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it fails to handle various cases and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with the constraints given.

**Correctness:** **False**
