Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Let's analyze why:

1. The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if Bob can set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. However, the current implementation does not properly handle the logic for setting up the stalls and their prices.

2. The logic inside `func_1` is flawed:
   - It starts by checking if `n == k`, which is correct because if Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels she wants, she can buy one jewel for one coin.
   - It then checks if `n < k`, which is also correct because if Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels she wants, it is impossible for her to buy `k` jewels.
   - The next part of the code attempts to set up the stalls but does not correctly calculate the prices or the number of stalls required. The logic for calculating `costs` and the subsequent loop is incorrect and does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. The program does not correctly implement the greedy approach described in the problem statement. It should set up the stalls such that Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall until she has bought exactly `k` jewels.

4. For example, consider the test case `n = 255` and `k = 8`. The correct output should be:
   ```
   YES
   8
   128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
   ```
   However, the provided code does not produce this output. Instead, it incorrectly sets up only two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which is not a valid solution.

5. Another issue is that the code does not handle the general case where `n` and `k` are arbitrary values within the given constraints. The current implementation is too simplistic and does not account for the need to set up multiple stalls with varying prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
