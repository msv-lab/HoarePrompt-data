The code snippet `curr = n // i` updates the value of `curr` based on the integer division of `n` by `i`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is 0
- `i` is `1 - k`

Since `n` is 0, performing integer division of 0 by any non-zero integer (including `1 - k`) will result in 0. Therefore, `curr` will be set to 0.

The other variables (`k`, `costs`, `h`, `h_initial`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is 0; `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\); `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`; `h` is `h_initial + curr`; `curr` is 0; `i` is 1 - k**.
