The given code snippet initializes a variable `h` to 0. None of the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `costs`) are modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is 0.**
