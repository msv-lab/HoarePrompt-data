### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Objective**: Set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - Number of test cases: `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`
   - Coins Alice has: `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^{18}`
   - Jewels Bob wants Alice to buy: `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}`
   - Each stall can have an unlimited number of jewels.
   - Price per jewel at each stall must be an integer between `1` and `10^{18}`.
   - Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next.

#### Code Analysis:
The code provided is incomplete and contains logical errors. Here’s a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Case 1**: If `n == k`, the function correctly prints "YES", `1`, and `1`.
   - **Case 2**: If `n < k`, the function correctly prints "NO".
   - **Case 3**: If `n > k`, the function initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]` and iterates over these costs. However, the logic to determine the number of stalls and their respective prices is flawed.
     - The loop calculates how many jewels Alice can buy at each cost but does not ensure that the total number of jewels bought equals `k`.
     - The condition `if (h < k)` is incorrect because `h` is not necessarily the total number of jewels bought; it is the sum of the number of jewels bought at each cost.
     - The function incorrectly prints "YES" and the costs even if the total number of jewels bought is not `k`.

2. **Logical Errors**:
   - The approach used in the function does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - The function does not consider setting up more than two stalls or varying prices to achieve the exact number of jewels.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up stalls with appropriate prices. One way to achieve this is by using binary representation or other methods to distribute the purchase of jewels across stalls.

### Conclusion:
Given the logical errors and the fact that the function does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, the provided code is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
