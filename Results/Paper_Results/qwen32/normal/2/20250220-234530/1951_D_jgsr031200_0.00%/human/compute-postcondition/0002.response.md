In the given initial state, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

This `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k` at all. It simply outputs the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **1**
