The code snippet provided is `h += curr`. Given the initial state, `curr` is 0, so adding `curr` to `h` does not change the value of `h`.

Therefore, the value of `h` remains `h_initial + curr`, which simplifies to `h_initial` because `curr` is 0.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is 0; `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\); `costs` is `[1 - k, 1]`; `h` is `h_initial`; `curr` is 0; `i` is 1 - k**
