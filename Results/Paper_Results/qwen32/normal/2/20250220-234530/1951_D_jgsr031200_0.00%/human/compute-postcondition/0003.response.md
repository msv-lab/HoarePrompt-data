Given the initial state where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\), and the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print(1)` statement.

Let's analyze the code snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

This `print` statement explicitly outputs the integer `1`.

The values of `n` and `k` do not affect the execution of this particular `print` statement because it does not reference these variables. Therefore, the output is simply the number `1`.

Output: **1**
