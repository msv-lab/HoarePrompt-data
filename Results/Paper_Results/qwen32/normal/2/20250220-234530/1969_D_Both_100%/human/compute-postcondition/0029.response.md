To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `while combined:`. This loop will execute as long as `combined` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list or all tuples if `combined` had fewer than `k` tuples.
- `combined` may or may not be empty.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`.
- `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`.
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`.
- `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged.
- `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0.
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

The only variable in the loop head is `combined`. For the loop to execute at least once, `combined` must not be empty.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `combined` is not empty. The other variables do not need to be adjusted because they do not affect the condition of the `while` loop directly.

State: **`heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list or all tuples if `combined` had fewer than `k` tuples; `combined` is not empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0; `test_cases` must be greater than 0**.
