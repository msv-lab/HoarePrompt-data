The given code snippet only updates the value of `max_profit` to be equal to `current_profit`. None of the other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `max_profit` is already equal to `current_profit` as per the description. Thus, executing the line `max_profit = current_profit` does not change the value of `max_profit`.

Output State: **`heap` contains `item` instead of the smallest element it previously contained; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was pushed. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`. `combined` is not empty but has one less element than before; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice (each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`), `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `test_cases` must be greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`.**
