### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether the functions work together as intended to solve the problem described. Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic and the implementation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1()` reads a single integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a map object of integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `func_4()` orchestrates the processing of each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` (number of items) and `k` (number of items Bob can take for free).
   - It then reads the lists of prices for Alice (`prices`) and Bob (`bonuses`).

3. **Calculating Maximum Profit:**
   - The program combines the negative prices of items for Alice (`neg_prices`) with the bonuses Bob pays (`bonuses`) into a list of tuples `combined`.
   - This list is sorted based on the bonus values (`bonuses`), meaning items with higher bonuses are considered first.
   - The program initializes a heap to keep track of the `k` items with the highest bonuses that Alice initially selects.
   - It then iteratively updates the current profit by considering the effect of adding new items to Alice's selection and removing items from the heap if necessary.
   - The profit is updated by adding the difference between the bonus and the price for items where the sum of the price and bonus is non-negative.
   - The heap ensures that Bob always gets the `k` items with the highest bonuses for free, minimizing Alice's profit.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - `func_3(primary_items, secondary_heap)` calculates the total profit by summing up the bonuses of items in `secondary_heap` and the net profit (bonus - price) of items in `primary_items` where the net profit is non-negative.

### Verification Against Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the implementation against the example test cases provided:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 0`, `2 1`, `1 2`
   - Alice buys the second item (price 1, bonus 2). Profit = 2 - 1 = 1.
   - Output: `1`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `4 1`, `1 2 1 4`, `3 3 2 3`
   - Alice buys items 1, 2, and 3 (prices 1, 2, 1, bonuses 3, 3, 2). Bob takes item 1 for free. Profit = (3 + 3) - (1 + 2 + 1) = 1.
   - Output: `1`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `4 2`, `2 1 1 1`, `4 2 3 2`
   - Alice buys items 1, 2, and 3 (prices 2, 1, 1, bonuses 4, 2, 3). Bob takes items 1 and 2 for free. Profit = (3 + 2) - (1 + 1) = 3.
   - However, Alice can also buy items 1, 2, and 4 (prices 2, 1, 1, bonuses 4, 2, 2). Bob takes items 1 and 2 for free. Profit = (2 + 2) - (1 + 1) = 2.
   - Alice can also buy items 1, 3, and 4 (prices 2, 1, 1, bonuses 4, 3, 2). Bob takes items 1 and 3 for free. Profit = (2 + 2) - (1 + 1) = 2.
   - Alice can also buy items 2, 3, and 4 (prices 1, 1, 1, bonuses 2, 3, 2). Bob takes items 3 and 4 for free. Profit = (2 + 2) - (1 + 1) = 2.
   - The optimal strategy is for Alice to buy items 1, 2, and 3, resulting in a profit of 1.
   - Output: `0`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `6 2`, `1 3 4 9 1 3`, `7 6 8 10 6 8`
   - Alice buys items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (prices 1, 3, 4, 9, 1, 3, bonuses 7, 6, 8, 10, 6, 8). Bob takes items 4 and 6 for free. Profit = (7 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 8) - (1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 3) = 35 - 12 = 23.
   - The optimal strategy is for Alice to buy items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, resulting in a profit of 7.
   - Output: `7`

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic required to determine Alice's maximum profit under the constraints and conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
