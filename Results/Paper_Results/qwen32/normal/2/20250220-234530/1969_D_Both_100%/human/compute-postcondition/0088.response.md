The code snippet assigns the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` to `current_profit`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `current_profit` is updated to the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list (or all elements if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements); `combined` is not empty, indicating it originally had fewer than `k` elements; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations (which is `0` if all iterations were completed); `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`; `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
