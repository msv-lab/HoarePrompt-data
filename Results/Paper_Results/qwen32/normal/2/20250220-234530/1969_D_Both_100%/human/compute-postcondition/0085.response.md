Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list plus the newly popped element from `combined` if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `heap` remains an empty list. `combined` has one less element than before if it was not empty, otherwise it remains an empty list. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `k` is greater than 0 (the value before it was decremented). `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `max_profit` is 0. `current_profit` is 0. `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
