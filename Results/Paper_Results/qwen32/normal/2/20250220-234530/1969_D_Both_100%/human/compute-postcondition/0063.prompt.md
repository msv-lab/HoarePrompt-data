Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` list or all tuples if `combined` had fewer than `k` tuples; `combined` may or may not be empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` if `combined` is not empty, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0; `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` contains `item` instead of the smallest element it previously contained; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was pushed. If `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`. `combined` is not empty but has one less element than before; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice (each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`), `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `test_cases` must be greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `heap` contains `item` instead of the smallest element it previously contained; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was pushed; if `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item` twice; `combined` is not empty and contains one less element than before; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice (each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`); `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `test_cases` must be greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined` before the pop operation; if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `heap` contains `item` instead of the smallest element it previously contained; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was pushed; `combined` is not empty except for one less element; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice (each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`); `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` must be greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined` before the pop operation; if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`. Additionally, if `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]` once more. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
