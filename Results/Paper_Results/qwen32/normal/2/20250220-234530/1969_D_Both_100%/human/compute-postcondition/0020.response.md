The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pops the last tuple from the `combined` list and pushes it onto the `heap`. This means that `combined` will have one less tuple, and `heap` will contain this new tuple.

Here's the breakdown of the changes:
- `combined` loses its last tuple.
- `heap` gains the tuple that was the last in `combined`.

Since no other variables are directly modified by this line of code, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains the last tuple from the original `combined` list if `combined` was non-empty, now it contains the tuple that was the second-to-last in `combined` after popping if `combined` was non-empty; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is 0; `current_profit` is 0; `combined` is a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, sorted by the `bonuses` values, and now has one less tuple if it was non-empty; `test_cases` must be greater than 0. If `combined` was empty, none of these changes occur.**
