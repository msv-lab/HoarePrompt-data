Postcondition: **`heap` is an empty list unless `combined` was not empty, in which case `heap` contains the last element that was in `combined`. `combined` has one less element than before if `combined` was not empty. `removed_item` holds the smallest item that was just popped from the heap during the last iteration if `combined` was not empty. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `k` is greater than 0. `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is the list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, specifically `neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]`. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `test_cases` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined` during the last iteration if `combined` was not empty. `current_profit` is 0. `max_profit` is 0. `remaining_items` is an empty list.**
