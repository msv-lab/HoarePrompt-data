The code snippet `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` reduces the value of `current_profit` by the first element of the `removed_item` tuple.

Given that `removed_item` holds the smallest element that was removed from the heap and is truthy, and considering the initial state, the value of `current_profit` will be adjusted by subtracting `removed_item[0]`.

Here's the updated state:

- `heap` contains `item` and the smallest element has been removed.
- `removed_item` holds the smallest element that was removed from the heap, which is truthy.
- `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`.
- `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations.
- `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice.
- `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.
- `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `combined` is an empty list.
- `item` is `some_value`.
- If the sum of the first two elements of `item` is non-negative, `current_profit` is reduced by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`.
- `current_profit` is now `current_profit - removed_item[0]`.
