You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: heap is a list representing a min-heap, remaining_items is a list of tuples, n is an integer representing the number of items, k is an integer representing the number of items Bob can take for free, prices is a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice, neg_prices is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, bonuses is a list of integers representing the bonuses Bob pays for items, max_profit is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, current_profit is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, combined is a list of tuples containing neg_prices and bonuses paired together, and the combined list is sorted based on the bonus values.
def func_4():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        heap = []
        
        remaining_items = []
        
        n, k = func_2()
        
        prices = list(func_2())

                heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
        
        if combined:
            current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
        
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
        
        while combined:
            item = combined.pop()
            if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
                current_profit -= item[1]
            else:
                current_profit += item[0]
            removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
            if removed_item:
                current_profit -= removed_item[0]
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        
        print(max_profit)
        
    #State: heap is [], remaining_items is [], n is the last value returned by func_2(), k is the last value returned by func_2(), prices is the last list returned by func_2(), neg_prices is the list of negative prices from the last iteration, bonuses is the last list returned by func_2(), max_profit is the maximum profit encountered, current_profit is the profit from the last iteration, combined is [], test_cases is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts several parameters including `heap` (a list representing a min-heap), `remaining_items` (a list of tuples), `n` (an integer representing the number of items), `k` (an integer representing the number of items Bob can take for free), `prices` (a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice), `neg_prices` (a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice), `bonuses` (a list of integers representing the bonuses Bob pays for items), `max_profit` (an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve), `current_profit` (an integer representing the current profit Alice has), and `combined` (a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, sorted based on the bonus values). The function calculates and returns the maximum profit Alice can achieve given the constraints and relationships between the input parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
