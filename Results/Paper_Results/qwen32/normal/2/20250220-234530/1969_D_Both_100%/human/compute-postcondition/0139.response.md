The code sorts the `combined` list based on the second element of each tuple (the bonus). This sorting does not affect the values of the other variables but changes the order of elements within the `combined` list.

Output State: **heap is an empty list; removed_item holds the smallest item that was just popped from the heap during the last iteration; n is the first value returned by `func_2()`; k is the second value returned by `func_2()`; prices is the list returned by `func_2()`; neg_prices is the list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, specifically `neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]`; bonuses is the list returned by `func_2()`; test_cases is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; combined is a list of tuples where each tuple contains corresponding elements from `neg_prices` and `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple; item is the last element that was popped from `combined` during the last iteration; current_profit is 0; max_profit is 0; remaining_items is an empty list.**

In natural language: The `combined` list is now sorted by the bonus values, while all other variables retain their previous values.
