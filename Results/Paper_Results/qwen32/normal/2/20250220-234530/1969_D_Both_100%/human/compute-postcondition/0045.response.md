The code snippet `current_profit -= item[1]` decreases the value of `current_profit` by the second element of the tuple `item`.

Given the initial state, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined` before the pop operation. This means `item[1]` refers to the second element of that tuple.

Since `current_profit` is already defined and `item[1]` is a specific value from the tuple `item`, we can express the new value of `current_profit` as its previous value minus `item[1]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `current_profit` is `current_profit - item[1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`heap` contains `item` instead of the smallest element it previously contained; `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before `item` was pushed; if `removed_item` is truthy, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`; `combined` is not empty and contains one less element than before; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice (each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`); `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` remains unchanged; `test_cases` must be greater than 0; `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined` before the pop operation; `current_profit` is `current_profit - item[1]`.**
