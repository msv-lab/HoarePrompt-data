Output State: **heap is an empty list; removed_item holds the smallest item that was just popped from the heap during the last iteration; n is the first value returned by `func_2()`; k is the second value returned by `func_2()`; prices is the list returned by `func_2()`; neg_prices is the list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, specifically `neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]`; bonuses is the list returned by `func_2()`; test_cases is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration; combined is an empty list; item is the last element that was popped from `combined` during the last iteration; current_profit reflects the final profit after all iterations; max_profit is 0; remaining_items is an empty list.**

In this output state, the only change is that `max_profit` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
