Given the code snippet `n, k = func_2()`, it implies that the function `func_2()` returns two values which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers representing the number of items and the number of items Bob can take for free respectively, after executing this line, `n` and `k` will be updated to whatever values `func_2()` returns.

Since the exact values returned by `func_2()` are not specified, we cannot determine the specific new values of `n` and `k`. However, we know they will be integers.

All other variables (`heap`, `remaining_items`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `combined`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Bob pays for items, `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, and the `combined` list is sorted based on the bonus values; `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**
