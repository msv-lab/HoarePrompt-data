The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `k`. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition, the only variable we need to adjust is `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be greater than 0.

Given the information:
- `k` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `k` should be incremented back to its value at the end of the previous iteration before it was decremented.

State: **`heap` contains the last element of the original `combined` list plus the newly popped element if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `heap` remains an empty list. `combined` has one less element than before if it was not empty, otherwise it remains an empty list. `remaining_items` is an empty list. `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`. `k` is greater than 0 (the value before it was decremented). `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice. `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`. `max_profit` is 0. `current_profit` is 0. `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
