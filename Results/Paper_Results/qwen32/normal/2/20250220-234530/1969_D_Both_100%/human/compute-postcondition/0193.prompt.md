Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `heap` is a list representing a min-heap, `remaining_items` is a list of tuples, `n` is an integer representing the number of items, `k` is an integer representing the number of items Bob can take for free, `prices` is a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Bob pays for items, `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, and the `combined` list is sorted based on the bonus values; `test_cases` holds the return value of `func_1()`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(test_cases):
    heap = []
    remaining_items = []
    n, k = func_2()
    prices = list(func_2())
    neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
    bonuses = list(func_2())
    max_profit = 0
    current_profit = 0
    combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
    combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
    for _ in range(k):
        if combined:
            heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
    if combined:
        current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit
    while combined:
        item = combined.pop()
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            current_profit -= item[1]
        else:
            current_profit += item[0]
        removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
        if removed_item:
            current_profit -= removed_item[0]
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
    print(max_profit)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `heap` contains the last `k` processed items, `combined` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is the maximum profit achieved, `current_profit` is the profit after processing all items, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: heap contains the last `k` items processed, `removed_item` holds the smallest item that was just popped from the heap during the last iteration, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is `0`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is the list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `combined` is an empty list, `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined` during the last iteration, `current_profit` reflects the final profit after all iterations, and `max_profit` reflects the maximum profit encountered during the iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements of `combined` if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements), `combined` is empty, `item` holds the value of the last element that was in `combined`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items` remain unchanged, `current_profit` is adjusted based on the final items processed, and `max_profit` holds the maximum profit encountered during the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
