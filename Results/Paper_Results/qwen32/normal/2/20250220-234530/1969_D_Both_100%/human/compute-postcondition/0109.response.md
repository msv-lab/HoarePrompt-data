Output State: **`heap` contains `item` and the smallest element has been removed; `removed_item` holds the smallest element that was removed from the heap; `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`; `k` is the initial value minus the number of iterations; `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice; `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`; `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `combined` is not empty but has one less element; `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined`; `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item`.**

In natural language: The `current_profit` has been reduced by the second element of the `item` that was popped from `combined`. All other variables retain their previous states.
