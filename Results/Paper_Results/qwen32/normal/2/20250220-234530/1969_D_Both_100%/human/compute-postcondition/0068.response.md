The code snippet reassigns the values of `n` and `k` using the return values from `func_2()`. The other variables (`heap`, `combined`, `remaining_items`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged.

Since `n` and `k` are reassigned, their new values are determined by the output of `func_2()`. The exact values of `n` and `k` depend on what `func_2()` returns, but we can denote them as the first and second return values of `func_2()` respectively.

Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `combined` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the first value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is the maximum profit achieved, `current_profit` is the profit after processing all items, `test_cases` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
