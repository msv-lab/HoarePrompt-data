To determine the output state, we need to understand what the function `func_1()` does. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context, we can only assume that it returns some value or modifies certain variables. However, without the definition of `func_1()`, we can only infer that `test_cases` will be assigned whatever `func_1()` returns.

Given the lack of details about `func_1()`, we cannot determine how it affects other variables like `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined`. Therefore, we can only state that `test_cases` will hold the return value of `func_1()`.

Output State: **`heap` is a list representing a min-heap, `remaining_items` is a list of tuples, `n` is an integer representing the number of items, `k` is an integer representing the number of items Bob can take for free, `prices` is a list of integers representing the prices of items for Alice, `neg_prices` is a list of integers representing the negative prices of items for Alice, `bonuses` is a list of integers representing the bonuses Bob pays for items, `max_profit` is an integer representing the maximum profit Alice can achieve, `current_profit` is an integer representing the current profit Alice has, `combined` is a list of tuples containing `neg_prices` and `bonuses` paired together, and the `combined` list is sorted based on the bonus values; `test_cases` holds the return value of `func_1()`.**
