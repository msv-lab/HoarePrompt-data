Postcondition: **`heap` contains the last `k` elements that were in `combined` (or all elements of `combined` if `combined` had fewer than `k` elements), excluding the smallest element, and excluding the item that was just popped from `combined`; `combined` contains at least one element less than before; `item` holds the value of the last element that was in `combined` before it was popped; `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `removed_item`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged; if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, then `current_profit` is decreased by the value of `item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`.**
