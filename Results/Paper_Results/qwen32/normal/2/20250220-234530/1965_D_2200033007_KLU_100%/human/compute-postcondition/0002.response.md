The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Since `smallList` was initially unchanged, after executing the code, `smallList` will have one less element than it did before.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed.**
