The code appends the value of `sm` to the list `cts`. No other variables are modified.

Given that `sm` is `2 * a[3] + a[4]`, the new element added to `cts` will be `2 * a[3] + a[4]`.

Therefore, the updated `cts` will include this new element at the end of the existing list.

Output State: **`a` remains the same, `cts` will be `[a[0], a[0] + a[1], a[0] + a[1] + a[2], ..., sum(a), a[1], a[1] + a[2], ..., sum(a) - a[0], a[3], 2 * a[3], 2 * a[3] + a[4]]`, `sm` is `2 * a[3] + a[4]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `len(a)` must be greater than 4**.
