Given the initial state, `bigList` has had its last `len(smallList)` elements removed. Since `smallList` is empty, no elements were removed from `bigList`. Therefore, `bigList` remains unchanged.

The code snippet `return bigList[-1]` returns the last element of `bigList`.

Output State: **The program returns the last element of `bigList`**.
