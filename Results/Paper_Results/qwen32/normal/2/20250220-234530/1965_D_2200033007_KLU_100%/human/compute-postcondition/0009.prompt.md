Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: bigList and smallList are lists of integers, and the elements in smallList are a subset of the elements at the end of bigList in the same order.
Code of the loop:
while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
    bigList.pop()
    smallList.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed twice, `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed twice.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `bigList` has its last element removed, making its length one less than before; `smallList` has its last element removed, making its length one less than before.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
