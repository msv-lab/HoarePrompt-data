Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed twice, `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed twice.**

Explanation: The code snippet `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Since `smallList` initially had its last element removed and then an element `x` was added, removing the last element again effectively reverts `smallList` to its state before `x` was added. Thus, `smallList` now has its last element removed twice, just like `bigList`.
