To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all possible iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop continues to execute as long as `smallList` is not empty and the last element of `bigList` matches the last element of `smallList`. Each iteration removes the last element from both `bigList` and `smallList`.

Given the initial condition that `smallList` is a subset of the elements at the end of `bigList` in the same order, the loop will continue until either `smallList` becomes empty or there is no longer a match between the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList`.

Since the loop runs until `smallList` is empty (as per the condition `len(smallList) > 0`), we can conclude that after all iterations, `smallList` will be empty. Additionally, `bigList` will have had its last `len(smallList)` elements removed, as each element of `smallList` corresponds to an element at the end of `bigList` that gets removed during each iteration.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`bigList` has its last `len(smallList)` elements removed, and `smallList` is empty.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `smallList` will be empty, and `bigList` will have lost all the elements that were originally at its end and matched the elements of `smallList` in the same order.
