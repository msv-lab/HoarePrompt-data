Output State: **`a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x]`, `b` is `l[x]`, `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` is 0., `n` is the input integer., `l` is the list of integers read from input., `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`, `x` is `x + 1`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `b` is updated to `l[x]`. The value of `a` remains either `l[0]` or `l[x]` (which was previously `l[x+1]`). The value of `c` is recalculated based on whether `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
