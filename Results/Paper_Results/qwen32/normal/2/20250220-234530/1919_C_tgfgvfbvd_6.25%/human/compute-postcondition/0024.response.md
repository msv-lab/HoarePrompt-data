Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is `l[x]`, `b` is the first element `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` is 0, and `l[x]` is greater than both `a` (previously) and `b`. Additionally, `l[x] - a` (previously) is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`.**

Explanation: The value of `a` is updated to be `l[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
