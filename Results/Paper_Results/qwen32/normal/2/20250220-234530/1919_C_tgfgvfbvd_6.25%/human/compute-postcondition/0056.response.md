Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers, `y` is 0, `x` is 1. If `l[1] > a` and `l[1] > b`, then `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a` is set to `l[1]` if `a - l[1] <= b - l[1]` or if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[1]`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[1]`.**
