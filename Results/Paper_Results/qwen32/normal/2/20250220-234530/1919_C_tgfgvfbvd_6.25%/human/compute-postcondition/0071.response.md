To determine what will be printed by the `print(c)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `a` is the smallest element in the sublist `l[y+1:n]`.
- `b` is the second smallest element in the sublist `l[y+1:n]` if it exists; otherwise, `b` is the same as `a`.
- `c` is the count of elements in the sublist `l[y+1:n]` that were greater than both `a` and `b` at any point during the loop.
- `y` is the last value of `y` before the loop breaks or completes all iterations.

The variable `c` specifically counts how many elements in the sublist `l[y+1:n]` were greater than both `a` and `b`.

Given this information, the output of the `print(c)` statement will be the value of `c`, which is the count of elements in the sublist `l[y+1:n]` that were greater than both the smallest (`a`) and the second smallest (`b`) elements in that sublist.

Since the exact values of `l`, `y`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `c`. However, we know the precise definition and context of `c`.

Therefore, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **c (where c is the count of elements in the sublist l[y+1:n] that were greater than both a and b)**
