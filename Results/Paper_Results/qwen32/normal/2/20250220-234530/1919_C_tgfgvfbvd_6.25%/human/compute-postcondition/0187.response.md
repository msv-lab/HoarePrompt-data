Postcondition: **`a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x]`, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor, `l[x]` if `l[x]` is greater than the previous `b`, or 0 if no such element exists. `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `c` is 0. `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from input, and `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`; otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`; otherwise, `a` remains `l[0]` and `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]`, and `b` is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x]` is greater than the previous `b`.**
