Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `y` is 2. If `l[y] > l[y - 1]`, `b` is the third element of the list `l` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
