Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is `l[0]`, `b` is `l[y]` where `y` is the first index such that `l[y] > l[y-1]` or `0` if no such index exists, `c` is `0`, and `y` is less than `n-1`. Additionally, either `l[x]` is not greater than `a` or `l[x]` is not greater than `b`.**
