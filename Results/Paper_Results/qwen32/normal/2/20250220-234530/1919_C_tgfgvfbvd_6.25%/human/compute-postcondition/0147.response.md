The value of `a` is updated to the first element of the list `l`. The values of `b`, `c`, `n`, `l`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `l[0]`, `b` is the second smallest value in `l[y+1:n]` or the initial `b`, `c` is the count of elements in `l[y+1:n]` that were greater than both `a` and `b`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is now a list of integers read from input, `y` is unchanged.**
