Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `y` is `y + 1`. If `l[y] > l[y - 1]`, then `b` is set to `l[y]` and `c` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `b` and `c` remain unchanged.**
