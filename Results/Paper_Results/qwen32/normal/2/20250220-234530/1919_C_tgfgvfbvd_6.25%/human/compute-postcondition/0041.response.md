Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `c` is 0, and `y` is 0. If `a >= l[x]`, then `b` remains the first element `l[y]` where `l[y] > l[y-1]` or 0 if no such element exists. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. Additionally, it is not the case that both `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`.**
