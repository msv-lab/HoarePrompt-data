Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is `l[0]`, `b` is `l[0]` if `l[y] > l[y - 1]` (and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement), otherwise `b` remains `0`, `c` is `0`, and `y` is `0`.**
