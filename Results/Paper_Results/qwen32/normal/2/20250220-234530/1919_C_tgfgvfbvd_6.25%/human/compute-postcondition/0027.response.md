Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is 0, `y` is 0, and `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`. If `l[x] - a` (previously) is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`.**
