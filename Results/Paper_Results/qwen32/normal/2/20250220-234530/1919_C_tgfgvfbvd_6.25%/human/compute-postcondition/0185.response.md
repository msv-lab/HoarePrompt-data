Postcondition: **`a` is either `l[0]` or `l[x]`, `b` is either the first element in `l` that is greater than its predecessor (or 0 if no such element exists) or `l[x]` if `l[x]` is greater than the previous `b`, `c` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the list of integers read from input, and `y` is an index such that `y < n - 1`. Additionally, if `a >= l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `b` remains unchanged or is updated to `l[x]` if `l[x]` is greater than the previous `b`. If `a < l[x]`, then `a` remains `l[0]` and `b` is updated to `l[x]`.**
