Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the first element of the list `l`, `c` is 0, `y` is 0, and the current value of `l[y]` is greater than `l[y - 1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
