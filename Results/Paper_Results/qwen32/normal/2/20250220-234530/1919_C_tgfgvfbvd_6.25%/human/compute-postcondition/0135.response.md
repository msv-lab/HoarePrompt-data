Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n-1`, `x` is `y + 3`, `a` is unchanged, `b` is `l[y + 3]`, `c` is unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `b` has been updated to be the element at index `x` (which is `y + 3`) in the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
