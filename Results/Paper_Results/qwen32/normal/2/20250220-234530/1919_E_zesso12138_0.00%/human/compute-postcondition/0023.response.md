The code snippet updates the list `p` by mapping the slice of `data` starting from `index` to `index + n` to integers. Here's the updated state:

- `n` remains `int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`.
- `p` is now a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`.
- `data` remains a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer.
- `index` remains `3 + 2*int(data[3 + 2*old_n]) + 1`.
- `t` remains the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `results` remains a list containing two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(old_n, p)`.
- `result` remains the value returned by `func_1(old_n, p)`.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[3 + 2*old_n])`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `3 + 2*int(data[3 + 2*old_n]) + 1`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(old_n, p)`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(old_n, p)`**.
