### Reasoning:

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many different arrays `a` can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The approach taken in the code involves dynamic programming to count the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum at each step.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - We initialize a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of `i - offset` after `j` steps.
   - `offset` is set to `n` to handle negative indices since prefix sums can be negative and we want to map them to non-negative indices in the DP array.
   - Initially, `dp[offset] = 1` because there's one way to have a prefix sum of `0` at the start (doing nothing).

2. **DP Transition**:
   - For each element in the array `a`, we can either add `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum.
   - We iterate through each position `i` from `1` to `n` (length of `a`), and for each possible prefix sum `j` in the DP array, we update the new DP array `new_dp` by considering adding `1` or `-1`.
   - If the current prefix sum `j` is reachable (`dp[j] > 0`), we update `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` accordingly, taking care to stay within bounds.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After processing all elements, the value at `dp[final_sum]` (where `final_sum = p[-1] + offset`) gives the number of ways to achieve the final sorted prefix sum `p[-1]`.

4. **Handling Input and Output**:
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases, processes each using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Analysis:

- The approach correctly models the problem using dynamic programming.
- It efficiently handles the constraints, with a time complexity of O(n^2) per test case, which is feasible given the constraints (sum of `n` over all test cases â‰¤ 5000).
- The use of modulo `998,244,353` ensures that the results fit within standard integer limits and meet the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
