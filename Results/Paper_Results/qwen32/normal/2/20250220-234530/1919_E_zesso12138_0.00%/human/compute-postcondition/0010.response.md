The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. Therefore, the new value of `index` is `2 + n`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `data`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
