Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is set to 1.
- `index` is calculated as `1 + sum(1 + n_i for i in range(1, t+1))`. Given `t` is 1, this simplifies to `1 + sum(1 + n_i for i in range(1, 2))`, which further simplifies to `1 + (1 + n_1)`. Since `n_1` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its exact value, but it does not affect the `results` list directly as per the given information.
- `results` is a list containing one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the respective `n` and `p` in the last iteration. Here, `n` and `p` are the values used in the last iteration.
- The variable `res` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we need to infer if it is related to `results` or any other part of the state.

### Analysis:
- The `print(res)` statement suggests that `res` should contain something meaningful. However, `res` is not defined in the initial state. It is possible that `res` is supposed to be an alias or a reference to an element in the `results` list or some other variable that was computed earlier in the code.
- Given the context, it seems likely that `res` might be intended to be the same as `results[0]` since `results` contains only one element.

### Conclusion:
Since `res` is not explicitly defined in the initial state and assuming it is meant to be `results[0]` based on the context, the output would be the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the respective `n` and `p` in the last iteration.

### Final Output:
Output: **result of func_1(n, p) (where n and p are the values used in the last iteration)**
