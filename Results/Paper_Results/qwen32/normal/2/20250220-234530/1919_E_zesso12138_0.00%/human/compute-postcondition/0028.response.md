In the given task, the for loop iterates over the `results` list. The variables in the loop head are `res` and `results`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on these two variables.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **`results` List**: The loop will execute if the `results` list contains at least one element. Therefore, `results` must have at least one element.

2. **`res` Variable**: This variable is an iterator over the `results` list. Its initial value is the first element of the `results` list. Since the loop will iterate over each element in `results`, `res` will take on the value of each element in sequence.

Given this, we need to ensure that `results` is initialized with at least one element. The current state mentions that `results` is a list containing `t` elements, but we need to ensure `t` is at least 1 to guarantee the loop executes.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- Ensure `t` is at least 1 to guarantee `results` has at least one element.
- `res` will be the first element of `results` when the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer value such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is `1 + sum(1 + n_i for i in range(1, t+1))`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the respective `n` and `p` in each iteration, `n` and `p` are the values used in the last iteration**. 

Since `t` must be at least 1, we can specify that `t` is 1 as a minimal requirement for the loop to execute.

Final State: **`t` is 1, `index` is `1 + sum(1 + n_i for i in range(1, t+1))`, `results` is a list containing 1 element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the respective `n` and `p` in the iteration, `n` and `p` are the values used in the last iteration**.
