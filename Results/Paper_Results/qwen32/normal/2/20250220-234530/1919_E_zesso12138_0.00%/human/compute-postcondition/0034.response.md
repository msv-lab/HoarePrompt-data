Based on the provided information, it appears that the variable `t` remains `1` throughout the loop's execution, and the `results` list contains only one element. This indicates that the loop will only iterate once because `t` determines the length of the `results` list, and `t` is `1`.

Since the loop iterates only once, the output state after all iterations (which is just one iteration in this case) is the same as the output state after the first iteration.

Therefore, the output state after all the executions of the loop has finished is:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `index` is `1 + sum(1 + n_i for i in range(1, t+1))`, `results` is a list containing 1 element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the respective `n` and `p` in the iteration, `n` and `p` are the values used in the last iteration**

In simple terms, the final state is that `t` is `1`, `index` is calculated based on the formula given, `results` contains one element which is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)` from the single iteration, and `n` and `p` are the values used during that iteration.
