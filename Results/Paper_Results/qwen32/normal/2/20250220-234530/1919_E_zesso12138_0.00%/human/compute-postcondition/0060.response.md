Postcondition: **`dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1`, `new_dp` is a list of zeros of length `2 * n + 1` except `new_dp[j + 1]` which is `(dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. `i` is 2, `n` is at least 0, and `dp[j]` is greater than 0. Additionally, `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0.**
