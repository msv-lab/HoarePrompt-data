The code appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. No other variables are modified.

Given the initial state, `results` initially contains one element, which is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`. After executing the code, `results` will contain two elements: the original value and the new value stored in `result`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer; `index` is `3 + 2*n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0] - 1`; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`**.
