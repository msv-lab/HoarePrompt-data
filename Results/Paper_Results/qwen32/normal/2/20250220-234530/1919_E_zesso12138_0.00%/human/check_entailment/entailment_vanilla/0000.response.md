### Reasoning:

The given problem requires counting the number of possible initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1`, such that when we compute the prefix sums `p` and sort them, they match the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

#### Explanation of the Provided Program:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sum array.
   - `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to reach a prefix sum of `j - offset` (where `offset = n`) using the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - The `dp` array is initialized with `dp[offset] = 1`, representing the starting point where the prefix sum is `0`.
   - For each element in `a`, the prefix sum can either increase by `1` (if the element is `1`) or decrease by `1` (if the element is `-1`). This is handled by updating the `new_dp` array accordingly.
   - After processing all elements, the value at `dp[final_sum]` (where `final_sum = p[-1] + offset`) gives the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sum array.

2. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the result.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the size `n` and the sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It calls `func_1` to compute the number of possible initial arrays `a` for each test case and stores the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

#### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- **Initialization**: The `dp` array is correctly initialized to handle prefix sums ranging from `-n` to `n` by using an offset of `n`.
- **Transition**: The transitions in the `dp` array correctly account for the two possible changes in prefix sums (`+1` or `-1`).
- **Final State**: The final state `dp[final_sum]` correctly represents the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sum array.
- **Modulo Operation**: All additions in the `dp` array are performed modulo `998,244,353` to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

#### Testing Against Example Inputs:

- The provided example inputs and outputs are correctly handled by the program.
- The program produces the expected results for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem using dynamic programming and handles the input/output as specified.

**Correctness: True**
