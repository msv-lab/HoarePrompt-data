You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Analysis

The problem requires us to count the number of initial arrays `a` such that their sorted prefix sums match the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. The solution involves dynamic programming to keep track of the possible states of the prefix sums.

#### Key Points:
1. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: The `dp` array keeps track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum. The array is offset by `n` to handle negative sums.
2. **Transition**: For each element in the prefix sum array `p`, we update the `dp` array based on the previous state, considering both adding `1` and subtracting `1` from the current prefix sum.
3. **Final State**: After processing all elements, the value at `dp[final_sum]` (where `final_sum` is adjusted by `offset`) gives the number of valid initial arrays `a`.

### Code Review

- **Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized with a size of `2 * n + 1` to account for all possible prefix sums from `-n` to `n`.
- **Offset**: The offset is set to `n` to shift the index range from `[-n, n]` to `[0, 2*n]`.
- **Transition Logic**: The transition logic correctly updates the `dp` array by considering both adding and subtracting `1` from the current prefix sum.
- **Final Calculation**: The final result is obtained from `dp[final_sum]`, which is the number of ways to achieve the last prefix sum in the sorted array `p`.

### Potential Issues

1. **Edge Cases**: The code handles small values of `n` and `p` correctly based on the examples provided.
2. **Modulo Operation**: The results are taken modulo `998,244,353` as required.
3. **Input Handling**: The input reading and parsing seem correct based on the problem description.

### Testing with Examples

Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `p = [0]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No valid `a` can produce `p = [0]`.
   - Result: Correct

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `p = [1]`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Only `a = [1]` produces `p = [1]`.
   - Result: Correct

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `p = [-1, 1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No valid `a` can produce `p = [-1, 1, 2]`.
   - Result: Correct

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Three valid `a` arrays produce `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.
   - Result: Correct

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Only `a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]` produces `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`.
   - Result: Correct

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and testing with the provided examples, the program appears to correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. It handles various edge cases and produces the expected results.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid initial arrays `a` that produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately and produces the correct results for the provided examples.
