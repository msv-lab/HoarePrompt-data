You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a list of integers starting with the length of the list, followed by specific values derived from `k`. The values include `k - 2^i`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + 2^i`, and `2^j` for `j` not equal to `i`, where `i` is the largest integer such that `2^(i+1)` is less than or equal to `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to generate a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `v`.

### Program Analysis:
The program constructs a sequence `a` based on the value of `k` and ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while ensuring all other sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) can be formed.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
3. It finds the largest power of 2 less than `k` using the variable `i`.
4. It initializes the sequence `ans` with three specific values:
   - `k - (1 << i)`
   - `k + 1`
   - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`
5. It then appends powers of 2 to the sequence `ans` except for the power of 2 corresponding to `i`.
6. Finally, it prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not explicitly check if the generated sequence meets the condition that no subsequence sums to `k`.
- The program does not ensure that all sums from `1` to `n` (except `k`) can be formed by subsequences of `a`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's consider a few test cases:

#### Test Case 1:
```
Input:
1
2 2

Expected Output:
1
1

Actual Output:
1
1

Explanation:
The sequence [1] satisfies both conditions:
- No subsequence sums to 2.
- The only possible sum is 1.
```

#### Test Case 2:
```
Input:
1
6 1

Expected Output:
5
2 3 4 5 6

Actual Output:
5
5 2 7 1 2

Explanation:
The sequence [5, 2, 7, 1, 2] does not satisfy the condition that no subsequence sums to 1.
Subsequences like [1] or [2, 2 - 1] sum to 1.
```

Based on the analysis and testing, the program does not guarantee that no subsequence will sum to `k` for all inputs. Specifically, the second test case shows that the program can produce a sequence that fails the first condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
