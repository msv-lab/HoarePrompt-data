The given code snippet updates the `ans` list to contain only three elements: `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`. This means that the previous contents of `ans` are discarded, and it now holds these new values.

Here's the updated state:

- `n` remains the first input integer.
- `k` remains the second input integer.
- `tc` remains `tc + 1`.
- `t` remains the same.
- The list described in the initial state is no longer relevant since `ans` is reassigned.
- `i` remains `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`.
- `ans` is now `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.**
