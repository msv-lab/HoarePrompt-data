Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to an input integer within the specified range. The conditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are described for each test case that will follow.
