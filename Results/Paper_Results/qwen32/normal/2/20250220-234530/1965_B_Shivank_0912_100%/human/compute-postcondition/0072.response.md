Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `k` is the second input integer.
- `tc` is incremented by 1 (`tc = tc + 1`).
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `i` is set to `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`.
- `ans` is constructed as follows:
  - Start with `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
  - Add `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 except `i`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine `i`**:
   - `i` is the largest integer such that `1 << i <= k` but `1 << (i + 1) > k`.
   - This means `i` is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Construct `ans`**:
   - The first three elements of `ans` are:
     - `k - (1 << i)`
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`
   - For the remaining elements, add `1 << j` for all `j` from 0 to 19 except `i`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `k = 10` for illustration purposes.

- Determine `i`:
  - `1 << 0 = 1`
  - `1 << 1 = 2`
  - `1 << 2 = 4`
  - `1 << 3 = 8`
  - `1 << 4 = 16` (which is greater than 10)
  - So, `i = 3`.

- Construct `ans`:
  - First three elements:
    - `k - (1 << i) = 10 - 8 = 2`
    - `k + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11`
    - `k + 1 + (1 << i) = 11 + 8 = 19`
  - Remaining elements (add `1 << j` for `j` from 0 to 19 except `i = 3`):
    - `1 << 0 = 1`
    - `1 << 1 = 2`
    - `1 << 2 = 4`
    - Skip `1 << 3 = 8`
    - `1 << 4 = 16`
    - Continue up to `1 << 19`

### Final `ans` List:
Given `k = 10` and `i = 3`, the `ans` list would be:
\[ [2, 11, 19, 1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144] \]

### General Description:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the `ans` list, which starts with three specific values derived from `k` and `i`, followed by powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19` except `1 << i`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2, 11, 19, 1, 2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144 (where the first three values are k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), and the rest are powers of 2 from 1 << 0 to 1 << 19 except 1 << i)**

This description provides a precise understanding of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the construction of `ans`.
