The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 20.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value, and it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, we need to increment `j` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Let's summarize the state adjustments:

- If `j` was equal to `i` at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` was `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.
- Otherwise, `ans` was `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j, 1 << (j + 1)]` and `j` was incremented by 1.

Since `j` is incremented at the start of each iteration, we need to increase `j` by 1 to get the correct state for the next iteration.

State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` if `j + 1` equals `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << (j + 1), 1 << (j + 2)]`, and `j` is `j + 1`**.
