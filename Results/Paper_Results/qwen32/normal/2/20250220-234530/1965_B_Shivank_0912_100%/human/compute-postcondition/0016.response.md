The only variable in the loop head is `j`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given that the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 19 (inclusive), at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have taken on a specific value. To proceed to the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value `x` where `0 <= x < 19`. For the loop to execute again, `j` should now be `x + 1`.

Since the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration isn't specified, we can generalize that `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` if `j` equals `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]` and `j` is not equal to `i`, `j` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `j` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `x + 1`. Since we don't know the exact value of `x`, we can say:

State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` if `j` equals `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]` and `j` is not equal to `i`, `j` is `j + 1`**.

However, to match the format of the previous examples, we can simply state:

State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` if `j` equals `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]` and `j` is not equal to `i`, `j` is incremented by 1**.

For clarity, let's assume `j` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 6:

State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` if `j` equals `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]` and `j` is not equal to `i`, `j` is 6**.

But since we need a general form:

State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` if `j` equals `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]` and `j` is not equal to `i`, `j` is incremented by 1**.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` if `j` equals `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), 1 << j]` and `j` is not equal to `i`, `j` is incremented by 1**.
