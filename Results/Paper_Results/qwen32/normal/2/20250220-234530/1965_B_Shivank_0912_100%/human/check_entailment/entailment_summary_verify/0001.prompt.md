You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a list of integers starting with the length of the list, followed by specific values derived from `k`. The values include `k - 2^i`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + 2^i`, and `2^j` for `j` not equal to `i`, where `i` is the largest integer such that `2^(i+1)` is less than or equal to `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem as per the requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We need a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
2. No subsequence of `a` should sum to `k`.
3. For every integer `v` in the range `[1, n]` except `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Program Analysis:

The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`. It then constructs a sequence `ans` that satisfies the conditions.

#### Key Steps in the Program:
1. **Determine the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`:**
   ```python
   i = 0
   while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
       i = i + 1
   ```
   This loop finds the largest `i` such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\). In other words, `1 << i` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Construct the sequence `ans`:**
   ```python
   ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
   for j in range(20):
       if j != i:
           ans.append(1 << j)
   ```
   - The sequence starts with three elements: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
   - It then appends powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{19}\) except \(2^i\).

#### Verification of Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** No subsequence of `a` should sum to `k`.
  - The element `k - (1 << i)` is less than `k` because `1 << i` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
  - The element `k + 1` is greater than `k`.
  - The element `k + 1 + (1 << i)` is also greater than `k`.
  - The remaining elements are powers of 2, none of which can sum to `k` because they are all greater than `k - (1 << i)` and do not include `2^i` which would be needed to reach `k` exactly.

- **Condition 2:** For every integer `v` in the range `[1, n]` except `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.
  - The inclusion of powers of 2 up to \(2^{19}\) allows us to form any sum up to \(2^{20} - 1\) using combinations of these powers of 2.
  - Since `n` is at most \(10^6\) and the sum of all powers of 2 up to \(2^{19}\) is \(2^{20} - 1 = 1048575\), this covers the range `[1, n]` for all possible values of `n`.
  - The exclusion of `2^i` ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed, as explained earlier.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
