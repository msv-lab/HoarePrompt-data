The code appends `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is 2, `1 << j` evaluates to `1 << 2`, which is 4. Therefore, 4 is appended to the list `ans`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `n` is still the first input integer.
- `k` is still the second input integer.
- `tc` is still `tc + 1`.
- `t` remains the same.
- `i` is still `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`.
- If `j` was not equal to `i`, `ans` now includes `1 << j` (which is 4).

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is `i_final` where `1 << (i_final + 1)` is the smallest power of 2 greater than `k`, `j` is 2, `ans` includes `1 << j` (which is 4).**
