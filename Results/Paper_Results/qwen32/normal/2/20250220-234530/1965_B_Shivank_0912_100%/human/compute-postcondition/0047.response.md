To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the components involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `n` and `k` are input integers.
   - `tc` is incremented by 1 (though this doesn't affect the `ans` list or its length).
   - `t` remains the same (also does not affect the `ans` list or its length).
   - `i_final` is the largest integer such that \(2^{(i_{final} + 1)} \leq k\).
   - `ans` is a list constructed as follows:
     - It starts with three specific elements: `k - (1 << i_final)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i_final)`.
     - It then includes powers of 2 from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{i_{final}-1}\).
     - It also includes powers of 2 from \(2^{i_{final}+1}\) up to \(2^{19}\).

2. **Constructing the `ans` list:**
   - The first three elements are fixed based on the value of `k` and `i_final`.
   - The next segment of the list includes \(i_{final}\) elements (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{i_{final}-1}\)).
   - The final segment of the list includes \(19 - i_{final}\) elements (from \(2^{i_{final}+1}\) to \(2^{19}\)).

3. **Calculating the length of `ans`:**
   - The total number of elements in `ans` is the sum of the lengths of these segments:
     - 3 (for the first three elements),
     - \(i_{final}\) (for the powers of 2 up to \(2^{i_{final}-1}\)),
     - \(19 - i_{final}\) (for the powers of 2 from \(2^{i_{final}+1}\) to \(2^{19}\)).
   - Therefore, the total length of `ans` is \(3 + i_{final} + (19 - i_{final}) = 22\).

Given this breakdown, the length of the `ans` list is always 22 regardless of the specific values of `n` and `k` (as long as they are valid integers and `i_final` is correctly computed).

Thus, the output of the `print(len(ans))` statement will be:

Output: **22**
