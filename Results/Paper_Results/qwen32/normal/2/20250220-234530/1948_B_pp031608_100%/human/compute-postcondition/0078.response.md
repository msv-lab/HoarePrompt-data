Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the first digit of the original `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]` where `nums` is a list consisting of the digits of the original `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `arr` or `ans`.**
