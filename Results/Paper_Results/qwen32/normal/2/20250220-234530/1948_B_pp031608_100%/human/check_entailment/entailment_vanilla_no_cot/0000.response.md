Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Elements**: The code attempts to check if the array can be sorted by considering pairs of elements from the end towards the beginning. However, it incorrectly assumes that if a pair is out of order, splitting the larger element will always result in a sorted sequence. This is not necessarily true.

2. **Handling of Splitting**: When the code finds an element that is out of order, it splits the previous element and checks if the resulting sequence is sorted. However, it does not properly handle the insertion of the split digits back into the array and continues checking from the same position, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **No Proper Handling of Multiple Splits**: The code only considers a single split operation when it encounters an out-of-order pair. It does not account for the possibility of needing to split multiple elements or the need to re-evaluate the entire array after a split.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Flatten the array by splitting numbers >= 10
        flat_arr = []
        for num in arr:
            if num >= 10:
                flat_arr.extend([int(digit) for digit in str(num)])
            else:
                flat_arr.append(num)
        
        # Check if the flattened array is sorted
        if flat_arr == sorted(flat_arr):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version first flattens the array by replacing each number that is at least 10 with its individual digits. Then, it checks if the resulting array is sorted. If it is, the answer is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO".
