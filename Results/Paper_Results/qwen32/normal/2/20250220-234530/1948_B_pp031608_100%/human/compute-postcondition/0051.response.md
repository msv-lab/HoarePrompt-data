To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99
- `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 2
- `arr` is a list of integers
- `i` is `m - 1`

The line of code converts the integer at index `i - 1` of the list `arr` into a string, then iterates over each character in that string, converting each character back to an integer, and finally concatenates this list of integers with the integer at index `i` of the list `arr`.

Let's denote:
- `arr[i - 1]` as `val1`
- `arr[i]` as `val2`

After the execution of the code, `nums` will be a list containing the digits of `val1` followed by `val2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

In simpler terms, `nums` now holds the digits of the number at position `i-1` in `arr` followed by the number at position `i` in `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
