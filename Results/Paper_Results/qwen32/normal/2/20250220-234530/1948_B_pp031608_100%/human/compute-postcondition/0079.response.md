To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the given for loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is defined as:

```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can see that the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99
- `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2
- The behavior of `arr` and `ans` based on the conditions provided

Since the loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive) with a decrement of `1` each time, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be decremented by `1` from its current value.

Let's assume the state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `i` is some value `k` (where `1 < k ≤ m - 1`)

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `i` is `k - 1`**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it as follows:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `i` is `i - 1`**

But to match the format of the previous examples, we'll use a specific example. Let's assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration (so `k = 3`), then at the start of the next iteration `i` should be 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `i` is 2**
