To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99
- `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 2
- `arr` is a list of integers
- `i` is `m - 2`

The line of code converts the integer at index `i - 1` in the list `arr` into a string, then splits this string into individual characters, converts each character back into an integer, and appends the integer at index `i` in the list `arr` to this list of integers.

Therefore, `nums` will be a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.

Since the values of `arr`, `i`, and `m` are not specified beyond these constraints, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `nums`. However, we can describe the structure of `nums` based on the given information.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.**
