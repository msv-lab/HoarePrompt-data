To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its effect on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
```

This line of code does the following:
1. It takes the element at index `i - 1` from the list `arr`.
2. Converts that element to a string.
3. Iterates over each character in the string, converting each character back to an integer and creating a list of these integers.
4. Appends the element at index `i` from the list `arr` to this new list.

Let's denote the value of `arr[i - 1]` as `arr_i_minus_1` and the value of `arr[i]` as `arr_i`.

Thus, the new list `nums` will be a concatenation of:
- A list of digits of `arr_i_minus_1` (each digit converted to an integer).
- The integer `arr_i`.

Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers, and `i` is `i - 1` (which implies `i` was previously incremented or set).

The output state will include:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` remains the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50).
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.
- `m` remains at least 2.
- `arr` remains a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `i` remains `i - 1`.
- `nums` is a new list formed as described above.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers formed by the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
