To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is the input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 99.
- `m` is an integer such that m ≥ 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers that may be modified according to the loop's logic.
- `ans` is a boolean value (True or False) that indicates whether any sequence (`nums`) was found to be unsorted.

### Print Statement Analysis:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

This line of code uses a list indexing trick to select between 'NO' and 'YES'. Here’s how it works:
- If `ans` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][False]`, which is equivalent to `['NO', 'YES'][0]`, resulting in `'NO'`.
- If `ans` is `True`, the expression evaluates to `['NO', 'YES'][True]`, which is equivalent to `['NO', 'YES'][1]`, resulting in `'YES'`.

### Determining the Output:
The output depends on the value of `ans`. Since the exact value of `ans` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output based on the possible values of `ans`.

- If `ans` is `False`, the output will be `'NO'`.
- If `ans` is `True`, the output will be `'YES'`.

Given this, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans] (where 'NO' is printed if ans is False and 'YES' is printed if ans is True)**

However, to adhere strictly to the format requested:

Output: **['NO', 'YES'][ans]**
