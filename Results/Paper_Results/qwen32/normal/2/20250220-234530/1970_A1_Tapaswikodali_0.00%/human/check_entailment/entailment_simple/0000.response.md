### Reasoning:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the input string `s` which is a balanced parentheses sequence. It initializes `balance` to 0 and an empty list `details`.

2. **Building the Details List**: The program iterates over each character in the string `s`. For each character, it updates the `balance`:
   - If the character is `'('`, it increments the `balance` by 1.
   - If the character is `')'`, it decrements the `balance` by 1.
   
   Alongside updating the balance, it appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the `details` list, where `i` is the current index of the character in the string. The `-i` ensures that in case of ties in the `balance`, the characters are sorted in decreasing order of their original positions.

3. **Sorting**: After constructing the `details` list, the program sorts it. Sorting by `balance` first and then by `-i` ensures that the characters are ordered according to the rules specified for the balanced shuffle operation.

4. **Generating the Result**: The program constructs the final result by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list, ignoring the `balance` and `-i` values.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the resulting shuffled string.

The program correctly follows the procedure outlined in the problem statement and produces the expected output for the given example. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
