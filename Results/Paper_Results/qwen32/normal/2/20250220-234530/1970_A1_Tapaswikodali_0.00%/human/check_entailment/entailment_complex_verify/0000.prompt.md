You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `balance` is 0; `details` is a list containing tuples `(balance, -i, char)` for each character in `s`, where `balance` reflects the net effect of all previous parentheses up to that point, `-i` is the negative index of the character, and `char` is the character itself.
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: s (where s is the given balanced parentheses sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")" representing a balanced parentheses sequence and prints the same sequence `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Input**: A balanced parentheses sequence `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
2. **Output**: The balanced shuffle of the input sequence `s`.
3. **Balanced Shuffle Operation**:
   - Compute the prefix balance for each character in the sequence.
   - Sort the characters based on their prefix balance in increasing order. In case of ties, sort by position in decreasing order.
   - Form the new sequence from the sorted characters.

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows these steps:

1. It reads the input string `s`.
2. It initializes `balance` to 0 and an empty list `details`.
3. It iterates over the characters in `s`, updating the `balance` and appending a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to `details`. Here, `-i` ensures that in case of ties in `balance`, characters with higher positions come first (since sorting is in ascending order).
4. It sorts the `details` list.
5. It constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details`.
6. It prints the result string.

### Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Input**: `(()(()))`
- **Prefix Balances**: `[0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`
- **Positions**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`
- **Characters**: `['(', '(', ')', '(', '(', ')', ')', ')']`
- **Details List**: `[(0, -1, '('), (1, -8, ')'), (1, -4, '('), (1, -2, '('), (2, -7, ')'), (2, -5, '('), (2, -3, ')'), (3, -6, ')')]`
- **Sorted Details**: `[(0, -1, '('), (1, -8, ')'), (1, -4, '('), (1, -2, '('), (2, -7, ')'), (2, -5, '('), (2, -3, ')'), (3, -6, ')')]`
- **Result**: `()(()())`

The program produces the correct output for the given example.

### Edge Cases

Let's consider some edge cases to ensure the program handles them correctly:

1. **Single Pair**: `()`
   - **Prefix Balances**: `[0, 1, 0]`
   - **Positions**: `[1, 2]`
   - **Characters**: `['(', ')']`
   - **Details List**: `[(0, -1, '('), (1, -2, ')')]`
   - **Sorted Details**: `[(0, -1, '('), (1, -2, ')')]`
   - **Result**: `()`

2. **Nested Pairs**: `((()))`
   - **Prefix Balances**: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0]`
   - **Positions**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
   - **Characters**: `['(', '(', '(', ')', ')', ')']`
   - **Details List**: `[(0, -1, '('), (1, -6, ')'), (2, -5, ')'), (3, -4, ')'), (2, -3, '('), (1, -2, '('), (0, -1, '(')]`
   - **Sorted Details**: `[(0, -1, '('), (1, -6, ')'), (1, -2, '('), (2, -5, ')'), (2, -3, '('), (3, -4, ')'), (0, -1, '(')]`
   - **Result**: `()(())`

3. **Alternating Pairs**: `(()())`
   - **Prefix Balances**: `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`
   - **Positions**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
   - **Characters**: `['(', '(', ')', '(', ')', ')']`
   - **Details List**: `[(0, -1, '('), (1, -6, ')'), (0, -5, ')'), (1, -4, '('), (0, -3, ')'), (1, -2, '('), (0, -1, '(')]`
   - **Sorted Details**: `[(0, -1, '('), (0, -5, ')'), (0, -3, ')'), (1, -6, ')'), (1, -4, '('), (1, -2, '('), (0, -1, '(')]`
   - **Result**: `()(())`

All edge cases seem to produce the correct results.
