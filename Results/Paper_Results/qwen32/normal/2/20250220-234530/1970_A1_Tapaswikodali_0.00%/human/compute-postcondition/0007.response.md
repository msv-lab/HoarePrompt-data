The code snippet decrements the `balance` variable by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `balance` is 0, after executing the code, `balance` will be -1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `balance` is -1, `details` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is not equal to "("**.
