The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `char`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `char` is the first character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `char` needs to be updated to the next character in the string `s`.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string and `i` starts at 0, the next value of `i` should be 1, and `char` should be the second character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and represents a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `details` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, 0, char)` where `balance` is 1 if `char` is "(" and -1 if `char` is ")"; `i` is 1; `char` is the second character of `s`.**
