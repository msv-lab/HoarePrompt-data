Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `tree` is a deque representing the entire path of the tree from one leaf to the other, `empty` is False, `start` is an integer read from the input, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list `[min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]`. Both elements in `moves` are even numbers.**
