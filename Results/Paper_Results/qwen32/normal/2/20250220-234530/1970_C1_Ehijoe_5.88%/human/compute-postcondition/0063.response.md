Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), an integer `t` which is always 1, a list of `n-1` edges represented as pairs of integers (u, v) indicating the connections between nodes (where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n), and an integer `u_1` representing the initial node where a stone is placed (where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n). The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The function returns the length of the longest path in the tree starting from the node `u_1`.**
