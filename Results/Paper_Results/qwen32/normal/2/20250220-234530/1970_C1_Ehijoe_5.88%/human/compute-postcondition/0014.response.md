The code appends the value of `u` to the `tree` deque. Therefore, `tree` now contains one more element, which is `u`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `tree` is a deque containing the elements it originally had plus `u`, `empty` is False, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, and `v` is not equal to `tree[0]`. Additionally, `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`.**
