Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `empty` is False, and `i` is 5. If `u` equals the first element of the `tree`, `v` is appended to the left end of the `tree`. Otherwise, if `u` equals the last element of the `tree`, `v` is appended to the right end of the `tree`.**
