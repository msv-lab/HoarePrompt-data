Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `tree` is a deque with `u` as its leftmost element, `empty` is False, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, and the current value of `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`.**

Explanation: The value of `u` has been added to the left end of the `tree` deque, making `u` the new leftmost element. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
