The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. Given the initial state, `n` is already defined as an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `t` is initially set to 1. The code will overwrite the value of `t` with the second integer read from the input.

Since the value of `n` is not being changed by the code snippet, it retains its initial value. The value of `t` is updated to the second integer provided in the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. There is a single integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the initial node where the stone is placed.**
