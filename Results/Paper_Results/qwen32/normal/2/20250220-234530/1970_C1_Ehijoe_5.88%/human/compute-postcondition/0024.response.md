Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the second integer read from the input, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, `u_1` is an integer (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n), `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, and `empty` is False. If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, `tree` remains unchanged. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, `tree` is a deque containing the elements it originally had plus `u`. If `v` is not equal to the first or last element of `tree`, and `u` equals the first element of `tree`, `tree` becomes a deque with `v` as its first element; if `u` equals the last element of `tree`, `tree` becomes a deque containing the previously last element of `tree` followed by `v`; otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.**
