Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, `bets` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `bets` ≤ `n`, `a` is a list of integers where the first `bets` elements are updated to `prod // a[i]` and other elements remain unchanged, `prod` is the product of the first `bets` elements of `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the first `bets` elements of `a`, and `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
