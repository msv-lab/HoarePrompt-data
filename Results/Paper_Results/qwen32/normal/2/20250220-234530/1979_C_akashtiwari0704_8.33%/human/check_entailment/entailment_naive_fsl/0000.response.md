Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's analyze the logic and see why it fails:

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to distribute `n` bets such that the total amount of coins bet (`sum(x_i)`) is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome (`k_i * x_i`).
- For each test case, we need to either find such a distribution or determine that it's impossible (`-1`).

### Program Analysis:
The program calculates a product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then divides this product by each multiplier to get the individual bets (`a[i] = prod // a[i]`). It then checks if the sum of these bets is less than the product. If not, it outputs `-1`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Distribution Logic**: The approach of using the product of all multipliers and dividing it by each multiplier is flawed. This does not guarantee that the sum of the bets will be less than each `k_i * x_i`. In fact, this approach often results in very large numbers and doesn't ensure the required condition.
   
2. **Edge Cases**: The program might fail on simple cases where a straightforward distribution is possible. For example, if all `k_i` are the same, betting `1` on each outcome would satisfy the condition.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
Expected output:
```
1 1 1
```
Explanation: Betting `1` on each outcome results in a total bet of `3`, which is less than `2 * 1 = 2` for each outcome, but since we need it to be strictly less than `2 * 1 = 2` for each outcome, this specific example is invalid. However, a valid distribution could be `1 1 1` because `1 < 2` for each outcome.

However, the program might output something like:
```
4 4 4
```
This is incorrect because `4 + 4 + 4 = 12` is not less than `2 * 4 = 8` for each outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the problem requirements correctly and fails on several potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
