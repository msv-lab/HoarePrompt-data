The code appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the existing string `ans`. 

Given the initial state, `ans` initially contains the values of `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` separated by spaces. After executing the line `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '`, `ans` will now include the value of `a[i]` again, followed by another space.

Output State: **`sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the value of `a[i-1]` followed by a space, then the value of `a[i]` followed by two spaces, then the value of `a[i]` again followed by a space, `bets` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
