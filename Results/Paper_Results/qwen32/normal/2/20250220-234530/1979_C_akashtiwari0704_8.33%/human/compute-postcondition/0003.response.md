The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `bets`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20; `bets` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
