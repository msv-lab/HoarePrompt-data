The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the existing string `ans`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `bets`, `prod`, `sumo`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20; `bets` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` has its first `bets` elements updated to `prod // a[i]` for `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`; `prod` remains the product of the original first `bets` elements of the list `a`; `sumo` is the sum of the updated first `bets` elements of `a` and is less than `prod`; `ans` is a string containing the previously accumulated values plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space; `i` is `i + 1`**.
