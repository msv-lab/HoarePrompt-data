The code multiplies the current value of `prod` by the element `a[i]`. Given that `prod` was initially 1, after executing the line `prod *= a[i]`, `prod` will take the value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is a list of `n` integers where each element `k_i` satisfies 2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20, `bets` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `prod` is `a[i]`**.
