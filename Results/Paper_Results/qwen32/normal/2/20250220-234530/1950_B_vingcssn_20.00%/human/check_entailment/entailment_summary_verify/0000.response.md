### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the provided program. The program explicitly checks for `n` values of 1, 2, 3, and 4 and outputs predefined patterns for these cases. However, it fails to handle any other values of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), including values such as 5, 6, ..., 20. Instead of generating the appropriate checkerboard pattern for these values, the program outputs "No esta en el rango".

To be considered correct, the program must generate the correct checkerboard pattern for all valid values of `n` from 1 to 20. Since the current implementation does not meet this requirement, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
