Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is equal to `t`, `c` is initialized to 0, `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1, `n` is not equal to 2, and `n` is either 3 or not equal to 3. If `n` is 3, then the current value of `n` remains 3. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 3 and could be 4 or any other integer except 1, 2, or 3. If `n` is 4, then the current value of `n` remains 4.**
