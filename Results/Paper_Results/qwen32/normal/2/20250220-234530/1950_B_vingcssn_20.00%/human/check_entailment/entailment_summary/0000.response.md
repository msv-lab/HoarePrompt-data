Reasoning: The provided program is designed to handle test cases where the input value of `n` ranges from 1 to 4. For each value of `n`, it correctly prints the corresponding 2n x 2n checkerboard pattern as described in the problem statement. However, the program does not handle values of `n` greater than 4, which is within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). Instead of generating the pattern for larger values of `n`, it outputs "No esta en el rango". This makes the program incorrect for any input where `n` is greater than 4.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all possible valid inputs as per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
