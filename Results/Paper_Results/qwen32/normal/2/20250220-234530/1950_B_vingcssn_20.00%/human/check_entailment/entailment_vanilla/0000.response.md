Reasoning:

The given program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case requires printing a 2n x 2n checkerboard pattern. The program correctly handles the cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 by explicitly printing the required patterns. However, there is a critical flaw in the program's logic for values of n greater than 4.

The program includes an `else` clause that prints 'No esta en el rango' (which translates to 'Not in the range') for any n value greater than 4. According to the problem statement, n can be up to 20, so the program should generate the correct checkerboard pattern for all values of n from 1 to 20, not just 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the program does not correctly handle values of n greater than 4, it fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
