You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

- Program:
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads another integer `n`. It then prints a specific pattern of hashes (`#`) and dots (`.`) based on the value of `n` for each test case. If `n` is not between 1 and 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case requires printing a 2n x 2n checkerboard pattern. The program correctly handles the cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 by explicitly printing the required patterns. However, there is a critical flaw in the program's logic for values of n greater than 4.

The program includes an `else` clause that prints 'No esta en el rango' (which translates to 'Not in the range') for any n value greater than 4. According to the problem statement, n can be up to 20, so the program should generate the correct checkerboard pattern for all values of n from 1 to 20, not just 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the program does not correctly handle values of n greater than 4, it fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
