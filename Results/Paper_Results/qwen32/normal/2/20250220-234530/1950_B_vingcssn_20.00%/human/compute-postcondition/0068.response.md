The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a specific string regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `casos`, `c`, and `n`.

Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 20.
- `casos` is set to the value of `t`.
- `c` is set to the integer value 2.
- `n` is an integer provided by user input.

However, none of these variables are used within the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'##..'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **##..**
