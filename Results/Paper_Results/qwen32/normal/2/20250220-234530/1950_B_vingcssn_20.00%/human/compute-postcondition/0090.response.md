To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop progresses and how the variables change throughout its execution.

The loop iterates `casos` times, which is initially set to `t`. The variable `c` ranges from 0 to `casos - 1`. For each iteration, an integer `n` is read from the input, and based on the value of `n`, specific patterns are printed.

Let's summarize the changes in the variables:
- `t`: This variable is the initial number of iterations and does not change during the loop.
- `casos`: This variable is set to `t` and also does not change during the loop.
- `c`: This variable starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `casos - 1`.
- `n`: This variable is set to the integer input for each iteration and does not persist between iterations.

After the loop completes, `c` will be equal to `casos`, meaning it has completed all iterations from 0 to `casos - 1`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations will be:
- `t` remains the same as the initial input.
- `casos` remains the same as the initial input.
- `c` will be equal to `casos` (i.e., `t`).

The variable `n` will not retain any specific value after the loop because it is re-assigned in each iteration and does not persist beyond the current iteration.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is equal to `t`, and `c` is equal to `t`.**

In natural language: After the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `t` and `casos` remain unchanged as they were initially, and `c` will be equal to the number of iterations, which is `t`. The variable `n` does not retain any specific value as it is re-assigned in each iteration.
