The `print` statement in the given Python code snippet is:

```python
print('##..##..')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'##..##..'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `casos`, `c`, `n`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **##..##..**
