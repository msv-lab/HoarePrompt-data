The only variable in the loop head is `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `c` and `casos`. The loop will continue as long as `c` is less than `casos`.

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 1 and `casos` is equal to `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 20). For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `c` should be 2, and `casos` remains equal to `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, `casos` is equal to `t`, `c` is 2, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is equal to 1, then `n` remains 1. If `n` is equal to 2, 3, or 4, then `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is not equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4, then `n` could be any other integer.**
