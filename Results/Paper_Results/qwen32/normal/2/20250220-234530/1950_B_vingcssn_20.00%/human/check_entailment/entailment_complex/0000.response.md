### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to handle up to four specific cases (when `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4). For each of these values of `n`, it prints a predefined pattern of `#` and `.` characters forming a checkerboard. However, the program does not handle any other values of `n` outside of this range. Specifically, for `n` greater than 4, the program outputs "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the appropriate checkerboard pattern.

The problem description specifies that `n` can be any integer from 1 to 20. Therefore, the program should correctly generate the checkerboard pattern for all values of `n` within this range, not just for `n` from 1 to 4. Since the program fails to do so for `n` greater than 4, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **False**
