The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `casos`. This integer represents the number of test cases, which was previously described as `t` in the initial state.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20. After executing the code snippet, `casos` will hold the same value as `t`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and `casos` is equal to `t`.**
