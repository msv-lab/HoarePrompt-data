#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The list `b` contains all elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`. The pointers `l` and `r` are such that `l` equals `r + 1` (or vice versa), indicating that all elements have been processed.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of `n` integers (constructed from `a` based on `s`), `l` and `r` are such that `l` equals `r + 1` (or vice versa), `ans` is a list of cumulative products of the elements of `b` in reverse order, `p` is the product of all elements in `b`.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which contains the cumulative products of the elements of `b` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `n`, an integer `m` (which is not used in the function), a list `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the direction specified by `s`. Then, it calculates the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order and returns these products as a list.
