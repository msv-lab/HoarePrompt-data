The given code snippet appends the element at index `r` from the list `a` to the list `b`. 

Given the initial state, `r` is `n - 1` if `s[i]` is 'L', and `r` is `n - 2` if `s[i]` is 'R'. Since the code does not specify the value of `s[i]`, we consider both cases:

1. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` initially contains the first element of `a`, and `r` is `n - 1`. After appending `a[r]` to `b`, `b` will contain two elements: the first element of `a` and the last element of `a`.
2. If `s[i]` is 'R', `b` initially contains the last element of `a`, and `r` is `n - 2`. After appending `a[r]` to `b`, `b` will contain two elements: the last element of `a` and the second-to-last element of `a`.

Since the initial state specifies that `i` is 1 and no other variables are modified except `b`, we can summarize the output state as follows:

If `s[1]` is 'L', `b` becomes `[a[0], a[n-1]]`.
If `s[1]` is 'R', `b` becomes `[a[n-1], a[n-2]]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[1]` is 'L', `b` is `[a[0], a[n-1]]`; otherwise, `b` is `[a[n-1], a[n-2]]`. `l` is 1 if `s[1]` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 0. `r` is `n - 1` if `s[1]` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`. `i` is 1.**
