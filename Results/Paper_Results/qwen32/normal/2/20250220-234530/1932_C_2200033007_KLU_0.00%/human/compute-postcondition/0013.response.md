The code increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is `[a[0], a[1]]`, `l` is 2, and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `b` is `[a[n-1], a[0]]`, `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 2`. `i` is 1.**
