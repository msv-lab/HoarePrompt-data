Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to correctly compute the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string for certain inputs.

Let's analyze the program with a specific test case:

### Test Case:
```
1
4
1101
1100
```

### Expected Output:
```
11000
1
```

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
11011
1
```

### Explanation of the Issue:
The program incorrectly constructs the string `s` and counts the number of paths `t`. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of why it fails:

1. **String Construction (`s`)**:
   - The program iterates through the columns and tries to find the point where switching rows would yield a lexicographically smaller string.
   - However, the logic for constructing the string `s` is flawed. In the given test case, the program incorrectly appends parts of the rows without ensuring the lexicographically smallest path is taken.
   
2. **Counting Paths (`t`)**:
   - The logic for counting the number of paths `t` is also flawed. The program attempts to count paths based on a substring match, but this approach does not correctly account for all possible paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.

### Another Test Case:
```
1
8
00100111
11101101
```

### Expected Output:
```
001001101
4
```

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
001001111
1
```

### Explanation of the Issue:
- The program again incorrectly constructs the string `s` and counts the number of paths `t`.
- The constructed string `s` is not the lexicographically smallest string, and the count of paths `t` is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases and fails to produce the expected results for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
