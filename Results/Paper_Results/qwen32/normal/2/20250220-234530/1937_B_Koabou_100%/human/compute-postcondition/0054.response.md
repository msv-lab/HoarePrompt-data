Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it prints a modified string derived from the input strings and an integer `1`. The modified string is formed by concatenating the first part of the top string up to a certain point with the rest of the bottom string starting from that point.**
