You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the length of the grid columns.
   - Then, it reads two binary strings representing the rows of the grid.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the path and variables `x` and `y` to track positions.
   - It iterates through the grid columns from left to right (except the last column).
   - During iteration, it checks two conditions:
     - If the next cell in the first row (`a[0][i + 1]`) is '0' and the current cell in the second row (`a[1][i]`) is '1', it updates `y` to the current index `i`.
     - If the next cell in the first row (`a[0][i + 1]`) is '1' and the current cell in the second row (`a[1][i]`) is '0', it constructs the path `s` by concatenating the substring of the first row up to `i + 1` and the substring of the second row from `i` to the end, sets `x` to `i`, and breaks the loop.
   - If the loop completes without breaking (meaning no transition from '1' in the second row to '0' in the first row was found), it constructs the path `s` by concatenating the entire first row and the last cell of the second row, setting `x` to `n - 1`.

3. **Counting Paths:**
   - The program initializes a counter `t` to 1.
   - It then iterates from `y` to `x` to check if the substring of the second row from `i` to `x` matches the corresponding substring of `s` starting from `i + 1`. If a match is found, it updates `t` to the number of possible paths and breaks the loop.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed path `s` and the count of paths `t`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Path Construction:**
   - The logic for constructing the path `s` is flawed. Specifically, the condition for breaking the loop when encountering a transition from '1' in the second row to '0' in the first row does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest path.
   - The path construction should consider all possible transitions and ensure the smallest lexicographical order.

2. **Incorrect Path Counting:**
   - The logic for counting the number of paths `t` is also flawed. The current implementation does not correctly account for all possible paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - The loop that checks for matching substrings is insufficient for counting all valid paths.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the entire first row is '0' or the entire second row is '1'.

### Conclusion:

Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
