Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by two binary strings of length `n`, representing the top and bottom rows of a 2 × `n` grid. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is an empty list. `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(2):
    a.append(input())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 · 10^5, the first binary string is of length `n`, the second binary string is of length `n`, `a` is a list containing one element, which is the input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 · 10^5, the first binary string is of length `n`, the second binary string is of length `n`, `a` is a list containing two elements, the first being the first binary string and the second being the newly appended binary string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 · 10^5, the first binary string is of length `n`, the second binary string is of length `n`, the newly appended binary string is of unknown length (as it depends on the input), `a` is a list containing three elements: the first binary string, the second binary string, and the newly appended binary string, `_` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
