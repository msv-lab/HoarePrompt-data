Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`; `_` is 1; `n` must be at least 4; `i` is 3. If `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, then `s` is the concatenation of the first 4 characters of `a[0]` and the substring of `a[1]` starting from index 3 to the end, and `x` is set to 3. Additionally, if `a[0][4] == '0' and a[1][3] == '1'`, `y` is set to 3; otherwise, `y` remains undefined.**
