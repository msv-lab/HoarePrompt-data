Let's break down the initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `a` remains the same (the exact value of `a` is not specified, but it's a list with at least two sublists).
- `_` is set to 1 (though this variable is not used in the provided code snippet, it's mentioned for completeness).
- `s` is calculated as `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`. Here, `n` is not explicitly defined, but we can infer it to be the length of the sublist `a[1]` since `a[1][n - 1]` refers to the last element of `a[1]`.
- `x` is set to `n - 1`, which is the last index of the sublist `a[1]`.
- `y` is described as the last index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0'` and `a[1][i] == '1'` was true before the loop completes. However, there is no loop in the provided code snippet, so this variable is not relevant to the current context.
- `t` is set to 1 (though this variable is not used in the provided code snippet, it's mentioned for completeness).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s, sep='')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the variable `s` with `sep=''`, which means the elements of `s` will be printed without any separator between them.
- `s` is defined as `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`. Since `n` is the length of `a[1]`, `a[1][n - 1]` is the last element of `a[1]`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the value of `s` is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last element of `a[1]`. Since the exact values of `a[0]` and `a[1]` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact printed value. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[0]a[1][-1] (where a[0] is the first element of the list `a` and a[1][-1] is the last element of the second sublist of `a`)**
