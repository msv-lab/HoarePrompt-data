#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by two binary strings of length n, representing the top and bottom rows of a 2 × n grid. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`, and `_` is 1.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`; `_` is 1; `s` is either `a[0][:k + 1] + a[1][k:]` if the loop breaks at `i = k` or `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]` if the loop completes; `x` is `k` if the loop breaks at `i = k` or `n - 1` if the loop completes; `y` is the last index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0'` and `a[1][i] == '1'` was true before the loop breaks or during the loop if it completes.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `a` remains the same, `_` is 1, `s` is `a[0] + a[1][n - 1]`, `x` is `n - 1`, `y` is the last index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0'` and `a[1][i] == '1'` was true before the loop completes, and `t` is 1.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: a[0]a[1][-1] (where a[0] is the first element of the list `a` and a[1][-1] is the last element of the second sublist of `a`)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it prints a modified string derived from the input strings and an integer `1`. The modified string is formed by concatenating the first part of the top string up to a certain point with the rest of the bottom string starting from that point.
