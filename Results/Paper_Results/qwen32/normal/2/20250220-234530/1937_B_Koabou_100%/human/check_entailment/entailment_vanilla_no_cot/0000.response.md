Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Let's analyze the logic and identify issues:

1. **Path Selection Logic**: The program attempts to find the lexicographically smallest path by making decisions based on the values in the grid. However, it doesn't handle all cases correctly. For example, it only considers the first point where a '0' in the top row aligns with a '1' in the bottom row and vice versa, but it doesn't guarantee that this will always lead to the smallest lexicographical string.

2. **Counting Paths**: The logic for counting the number of paths that yield the smallest string is flawed. The current implementation incorrectly calculates the number of paths based on a specific segment comparison which might not cover all valid paths.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, when the entire top row is '0's and the entire bottom row is '1's, the smallest string should be the top row followed by the last element of the bottom row, but the program may not handle this correctly.

To correctly solve the problem, a more robust approach would involve dynamic programming to keep track of the smallest lexicographical string and the number of ways to achieve it at each step. Here's a high-level outline of a correct approach:

- Use dynamic programming to fill two tables: one for the smallest lexicographical string (`dp_str`) and another for the number of ways to achieve that string (`dp_cnt`).
- Initialize the starting point `(1, 1)` with the value from the grid.
- Iterate through the grid, updating the `dp_str` and `dp_cnt` tables based on the minimum lexicographical string that can be formed by moving right or down.
- The final answer will be found in the bottom-right cell of these tables.

Given the complexity of the correct solution, the provided program does not meet the requirements and is therefore incorrect.
