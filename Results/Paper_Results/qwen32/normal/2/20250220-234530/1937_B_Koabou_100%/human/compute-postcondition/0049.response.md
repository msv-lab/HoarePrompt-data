Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`, `_` is 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `y` is the last index where `a[0][i + 1] == '0'` and `a[1][i] == '1'` was true before the loop breaks, `x` is `k`. If `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]`, then `t` is set to `k - i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
