Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two binary strings of length `n`, representing the top and bottom rows of a 2 × n grid. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given binary strings.**
