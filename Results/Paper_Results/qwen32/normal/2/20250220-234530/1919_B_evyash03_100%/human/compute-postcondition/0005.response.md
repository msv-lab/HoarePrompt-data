To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `char` and `expression`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over each character in the string `expression`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `char` was the character that was just processed.
3. For the loop to continue, there must be another character in `expression` to process.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
- `char` is the character that was just processed.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `char` should be the next character in the string `expression`.
- Since `char` was the last processed character, the next character would be the one immediately following it in the string.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `char` is now the next character in `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `char` is the next character in `expression`**.

However, since we don't know the exact position of `char` in `expression` from the given state, we can denote the next character more precisely by considering the index. Let's assume `index` is the position of `char` in `expression` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `index` would be incremented by 1.

Revised State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `index` is the position of `char` in `expression` at the end of the previous iteration + 1, `char` is `expression[index]`**.

Since the problem specifies only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head (`char` and `expression`), and we don't have an explicit `index` variable in the loop head, the most accurate representation without introducing new variables is:

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `char` is the next character in `expression`**.

But to be more precise with the loop mechanics:

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `char` is the character at the position `index + 1` in `expression`**, where `index` is the position of `char` at the end of the previous iteration.

Since we cannot introduce `index` explicitly, the final state considering only `char` and `expression` is:

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `char` is the next character in `expression`**.
