### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code defines a function `func_1` which calculates the absolute difference between the length of the string and twice the number of '+' characters in the string. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:
1. It counts the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.
2. It calculates the number of '-' characters by subtracting the count of '+' characters from the total length of the string.
3. It returns the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
The provided solution does not actually solve the problem as described. The optimal way to minimize the penalty involves splitting the array in such a way that the sum of the penalties of the resulting subarrays is minimized. This typically requires more sophisticated logic than simply counting '+' and '-' characters and returning their absolute difference.

For example, consider the third test case:
- Input: `+-+-+-`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Explanation: One optimal way to split this array is into `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, each subarray having a penalty of `0`.

However, the provided function would return `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, which happens to be correct for this specific case but is not a general solution.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not implement the correct algorithm to solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

### Response:
Reasoning: The provided code does not correctly implement the algorithm needed to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array. It only calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.
Correctness: **False**
