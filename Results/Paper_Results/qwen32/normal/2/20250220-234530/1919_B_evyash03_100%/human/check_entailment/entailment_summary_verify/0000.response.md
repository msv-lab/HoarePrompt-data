### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program.

#### Problem Recap:
The goal is to split the array derived from the string `s` (where each '+' contributes +1 and each '-' contributes -1) into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the absolute difference between the length of the string and twice the number of '+' characters in the string. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program does not consider any splitting strategy. It simply computes a value based on the counts of '+' and '-' without attempting to split the array optimally.
2. **No Splitting Strategy**: The optimal solution involves finding the best way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. This requires dynamic programming or a greedy approach, which the current program does not implement.
3. **Counterexample**: The original assessment provides a counterexample that demonstrates the program's failure to find the minimum penalty. The example shows that the program's output is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal splits.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one would need to use a dynamic programming approach or a greedy algorithm that considers all possible splits and calculates the penalties accordingly. The provided program does not implement any such strategy.

#### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
