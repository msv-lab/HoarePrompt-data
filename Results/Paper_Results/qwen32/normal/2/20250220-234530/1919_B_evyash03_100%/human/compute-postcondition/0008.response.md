The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, which iterates over each character in the string `expression`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `char` and how it relates to the string `expression`.

Given:
- `expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
- `char` is the next character in `expression`.
- If `char` is '+', `count` is incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `char` was the current character being processed. For the next iteration, `char` should be the next character in the string `expression`.

Let's denote the current position of `char` in `expression` as `position`. At the end of the previous iteration, `position` would have been the index of `char` in `expression`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `position` should be incremented by 1, and `char` should be set to the character at the new `position`.

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `char` is the character at position `position + 1` in `expression`.** 

Since we don't have the exact value of `position` or the specific characters in `expression`, we can only describe the state in terms of the next character in the sequence.

Final Answer:
State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `char` is the next character in `expression`.**
