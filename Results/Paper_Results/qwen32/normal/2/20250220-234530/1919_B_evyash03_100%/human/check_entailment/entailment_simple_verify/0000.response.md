### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
Given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`, we need to split it into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of penalties is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program calculates the number of `+` characters (`count`) and the number of `-` characters (`sub = length - count`). It then returns `abs(sub - count)`.

#### Annotations:
- Before the function call: `expression` is a string of length `length` consisting of `+` and `-`.
- Inside the function: `count` is the number of `+` characters in `expression`.
- The function returns `abs(length - 2 * count)`.

#### Evaluation Using Annotations:
The program essentially computes the absolute difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters. However, this does not correspond to the minimum penalty calculation as required by the problem statement.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
6
+-++--+
```
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: One optimal split is `([1, -1, 1], [-1, 1, -1])` with penalties `3` and `3`, giving a total penalty of `6 - 4 = 2`.
- Program Output: `abs(3 - 3) = 0`, which is incorrect.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to explore different ways to split the array and calculate the penalties for each split. The optimal solution involves dynamic programming or a greedy approach to find the minimum penalty.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty. It only calculates the absolute difference between the counts of `+` and `-` characters, which is insufficient for solving the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
