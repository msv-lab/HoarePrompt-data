The given code appends the last element of the list `b` to the list `ans1`. Since `b[n - 1]` is already the last element of `b` and `ans1` already contains `b[n - 1]` (as per the initial state), appending `b[n - 1]` again means `ans1` will now contain two identical elements, both being `b[n - 1]`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is twice the second integer read from the input, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is the sorted list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, `ans1` is a list containing the last element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input. Additionally, `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`.**
