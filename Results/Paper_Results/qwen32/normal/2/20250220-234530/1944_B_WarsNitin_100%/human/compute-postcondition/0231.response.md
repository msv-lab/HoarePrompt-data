Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of the new `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is either `[b[i], b[i]]` if `b[n-2] != b[n-1]` and `b[i] == b[i-1]`, or `[b[n-1], b[n-1], b[i], b[i]]` if `b[n-2] == b[n-1]` and `b[i] == b[i-1]`, or an empty list otherwise. `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is the last index processed before the loop breaks, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is twice the second integer read from the input minus 4 if `b[i] == b[i-1]` and `b[n-2] == b[n-1]`, otherwise `k` is twice the second integer read from the input if `b[n-2] != b[n-1]`, or `k` is twice the second integer read from the input minus 2 if `b[n-2] == b[n-1]` and `b[i] != b[i-1]`. `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`. If `b[i] != b[i + 1]` and `b[i] != b[i-1]`, then `l` also includes `b[i]`.**
