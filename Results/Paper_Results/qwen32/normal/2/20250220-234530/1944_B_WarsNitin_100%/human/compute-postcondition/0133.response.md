Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a` sorted in ascending order, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is the last index processed before the loop breaks, `ans2` is `[]`, and `l` is determined based on conditions involving `b`. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is either `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1], b[i], b[i]]` or `[b[i], b[i]]`, and `k` is either -2 or `req - 4`. Otherwise, `ans1` is either `[]` or `[b[n - 1], b[n - 1]]`, `k` is either 0 or `req - 2`, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, then `b[i]` is appended to `l` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1].`**
