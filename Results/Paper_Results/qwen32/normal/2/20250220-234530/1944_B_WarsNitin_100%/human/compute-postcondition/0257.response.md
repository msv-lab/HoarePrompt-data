The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `c` to the list `ans2`. 

Given the initial state, `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`.

Therefore, `ans2` will now contain the element `c[1]` (which is the same as `c[0]`).

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of the new `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, sorted in ascending order, `ans1` contains all pairs of equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` reaches 0, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is 1, `ans2` is a list containing `c[1]` (which is equal to `c[0]`), `k` is either 0 or its original value, and `l` contains the first element of `b` if it is unique, and all unique elements from `b` that are not part of any pair. Additionally, `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`.**
