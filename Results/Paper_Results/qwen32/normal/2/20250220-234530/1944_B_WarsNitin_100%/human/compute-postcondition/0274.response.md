Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of the new `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, sorted in ascending order, `ans1` contains all pairs of equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` reaches 0, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is 3, `ans2` is a list containing `c[0]`, `c[1]`, `c[3]`, and `c[3]` again if `c[3] == c[2]`, `l` contains the first element of `b` if it is unique, and all unique elements from `b` that are not part of any pair. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `k` is decreased by 2 if `c[3] == c[2]`.**
