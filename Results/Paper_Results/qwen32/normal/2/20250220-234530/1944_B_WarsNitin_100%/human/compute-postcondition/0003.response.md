The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns these integers to the list `a`. This means that the initial value of `a` (which was described as a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice) is now replaced by the new list of integers read from the input.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `q` remains 0.
- `n` remains the first integer read from the input.
- `k` remains the second integer read from the input.
- `a` is now the list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is the list of integers read from the input.**
