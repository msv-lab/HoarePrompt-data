To determine the output of the `print(*ans1)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the definitions of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:

- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 (not directly relevant to `ans1`).
- `q`: Always set to 1 (not directly relevant to `ans1`).
- `n`: An integer greater than 2.
- `a`: A list of integers read from the input.
- `b`: The first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order.
- `c`: The sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a` sorted in ascending order.
- `ans1`: Contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 and additionally contains elements from `l` until `k` reaches 0 or `l` is exhausted.
- `req`: Twice the second integer read from the input (not directly relevant to `ans1`).
- `i`: The last index processed before the loop breaks (not directly relevant to `ans1`).
- `ans2`: Contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 and additionally contains elements from `l` until `k` reaches 0 or `l` is exhausted (not directly relevant to `ans1`).
- `l`: Contains elements from `b` that are not part of any pair of consecutive equal elements and are not equal to their next element.
- `k`: 0 if the loop broke due to `k` reaching 0, otherwise it is the remaining value.

### Analysis of `ans1`:

`ans1` is constructed based on the following logic:
1. It starts with pairs of consecutive equal elements from `b` until `k` becomes 0.
2. If `k` is not yet 0, it continues to add elements from `l` until `k` reaches 0 or `l` is exhausted.

### Determining the Output:

Given the construction of `ans1`, the output will be the contents of `ans1` separated by spaces. Since the exact values of `b` and `l` depend on the input list `a` and the value of `k`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values without knowing these inputs. However, we can describe the output in terms of the structure of `ans1`.

### Final Output Description:

The `print(*ans1)` statement will print the elements of `ans1`, which consists of pairs of consecutive equal elements from the sorted sublist `b` and possibly additional elements from `l` if `k` hasn't reached 0 after processing the pairs.

Output: **elements of ans1 (where ans1 contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from b and possibly additional elements from l until k reaches 0 or l is exhausted)**
