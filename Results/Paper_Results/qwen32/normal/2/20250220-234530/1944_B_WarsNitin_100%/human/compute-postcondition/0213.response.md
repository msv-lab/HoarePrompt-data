Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 2, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of the new `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is an empty list, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is the last index processed before the loop breaks, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is twice the second integer read from the input. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `l` is a list containing the first element of `b`. Otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.**
