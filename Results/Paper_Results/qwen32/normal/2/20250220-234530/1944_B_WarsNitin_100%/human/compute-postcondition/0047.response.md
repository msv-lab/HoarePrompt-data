Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `b` is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`, `c` is the sorted list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `l` contains the first element of `b` if `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`. Additionally, if `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, `l` also contains the last element of `b`, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
