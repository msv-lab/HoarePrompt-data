Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is the newly read list of integers from the input, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a` sorted in ascending order, `ans1` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0, `req` is twice the second integer read from the input, `i` is the last index processed before the loop breaks, `ans2` is `[]`, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not part of any pair of consecutive equal elements and are not equal to their next element. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
