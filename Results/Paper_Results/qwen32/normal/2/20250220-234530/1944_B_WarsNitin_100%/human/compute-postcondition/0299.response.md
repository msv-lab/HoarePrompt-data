Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and an integer `k`, along with an array `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
