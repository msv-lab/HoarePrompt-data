To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans1)` statement, let's break down the components involved in the construction of `ans1` based on the initial state provided:

1. **List `a`**: This is a list of integers read from the input.
2. **List `b`**: This is the sorted list of the first `n` integers from `a`.
3. **List `c`**: This is the sorted list of integers from `a` starting from index `n` to the end of `a`.
4. **List `l`**: This is a list containing at least one element.
5. **Variable `k_initial`**: This is an integer value, but its specific value isn't provided in the initial state.
6. **Variable `ans1`**: This list is constructed by taking repeated elements from `b` where consecutive elements are equal, and then adding up to `min(k_initial, len(l))` elements from `l`.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

- **Constructing `b` and `c`**:
  - `b` is the sorted version of the first `n` elements of `a`.
  - `c` is the sorted version of the remaining elements of `a` after the first `n` elements.

- **Finding Repeated Elements in `b`**:
  - `ans1` starts with elements from `b` that have consecutive duplicates. For example, if `b = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]`, then the repeated elements would be `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`.

- **Adding Elements from `l`**:
  - After adding the repeated elements from `b`, `ans1` is extended by up to `min(k_initial, len(l))` elements from `l`. This means if `k_initial` is 3 and `l` has 5 elements, only the first 3 elements of `l` will be added to `ans1`.

### Example Scenario:

Let's assume some concrete values for clarity:
- Suppose `a = [3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 5`.
- Then, `b = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]` (first 5 elements of `a` sorted).
- And, `c = [3, 4, 5, 6]` (remaining elements of `a` sorted).
- Assume `l = [7, 8, 9]` and `k_initial = 2`.

- **Repeated Elements in `b`**:
  - From `b = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, the repeated elements are `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.

- **Adding Elements from `l`**:
  - Since `k_initial = 2` and `len(l) = 3`, we add the first 2 elements of `l` to `ans1`.
  - Thus, `ans1` becomes `[1, 1, 2, 2, 7, 8]`.

### General Description:

Given the above breakdown, the `print(*ans1)` statement will print the elements of `ans1`, which includes:
- All repeated consecutive elements from the sorted list `b`.
- Up to `min(k_initial, len(l))` elements from the list `l`.

### Final Output:

Output: **repeated elements from `b` followed by up to `min(k_initial, len(l))` elements from `l`**
