To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step-by-step:

1. **Input Variables:**
   - `n`: An integer representing the number of elements in the list `T`.
   - `line`: A string that will be split into a list of integers `T`.

2. **Derived Variables:**
   - `T`: A list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`. This means `T` contains `n` integers.
   - `a`: A list constructed using a list comprehension. For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, it calculates `1000 - T[i - 1]` and appends `1000` at the end.
   - `result`: A space-separated string of the elements in the list `a`.

3. **List Comprehension for `a`:**
   - For `i = 1` to `n-1`, the element at position `i-1` in `T` is subtracted from `1000` and added to the list `a`.
   - Finally, `1000` is appended to the list `a`.

4. **Constructing `result`:**
   - The list `a` is converted to a space-separated string and stored in `result`.

Given this understanding, the `print(result)` statement will output a space-separated string of the calculated values from the list comprehension followed by `1000`.

Let's formalize this:

- If `T` is `[T0, T1, ..., T(n-1)]`, then `a` will be `[1000 - T0, 1000 - T1, ..., 1000 - T(n-2), 1000]`.
- `result` will be the string representation of this list with spaces between the numbers.

Thus, the output will be a sequence of numbers where each number (except the last one) is `1000` minus the corresponding element from `T`, and the last number is `1000`.

Output: **1000 - T0 1000 - T1 ... 1000 - T(n-2) 1000 (where T0, T1, ..., T(n-1) are the elements of the list T derived from the input string line)**
