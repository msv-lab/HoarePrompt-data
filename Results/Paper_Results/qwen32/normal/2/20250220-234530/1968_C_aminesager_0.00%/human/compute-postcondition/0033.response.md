To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a list containing `n` elements.
   - These elements are constructed such that the first element of the new `a` is the last element of the original `a`.
   - Each subsequent element in the new `a` is the sum of the previous element in the new `a` and the corresponding element from `T` (which is taken in reverse order).

2. **Result Construction**:
   - `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in the newly constructed `a`.

Given this, let's denote the original list `a` as `[a1, a2, ..., an]` and the list `T` as `[t1, t2, ..., tn]`.

The new list `a` will be constructed as follows:
- The first element of the new `a` is `an`.
- The second element of the new `a` is `an + tn`.
- The third element of the new `a` is `(an + tn) + tn-1`.
- This pattern continues until the nth element of the new `a`, which is `(an + tn + tn-1 + ... + t2) + t1`.

Thus, the new `a` list can be described as:
\[ \text{new\_a} = [an, an + tn, an + tn + tn-1, \ldots, an + tn + tn-1 + \ldots + t2 + t1] \]

The `result` variable is then a space-separated string of these elements.

Since the exact values of `a` and `T` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the new `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the space-separated string of the newly constructed `a` list.

Therefore, the output will be a space-separated string of the elements in the newly constructed `a` list, where each element is computed as described above.

Output: **result (where result is a space-separated string of the elements in the newly constructed list `a`, where each element is computed as described above)**
