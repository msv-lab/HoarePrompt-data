The given code snippet reverses the list `a`. 

Initial State: `a` contains `n` elements starting with `1000` and each subsequent element is the previous element minus the corresponding element in `T`. The `result` is a space-separated string of these elements.

After executing `a = a[::-1]`, the list `a` is reversed. This means the first element becomes the last, the second element becomes the second-to-last, and so on.

Output State: **`a` contains `n` elements starting with the last element of the original `a` and each subsequent element is the previous element plus the corresponding element in `T` (in reverse order); `result` is a space-separated string of these elements.**

Natural Language Explanation: The list `a` is now in reverse order compared to its initial state. The `result` remains a space-separated string of these elements, but their order in the string is also reversed.
