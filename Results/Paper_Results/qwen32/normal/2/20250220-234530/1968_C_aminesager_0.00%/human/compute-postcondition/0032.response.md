To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and how the variables are constructed:

1. **Initial State Description**:
   - `a` is a list that starts with the last element of the original `a` list.
   - Each subsequent element in `a` is derived by adding the previous element in the new `a` to the corresponding element in `T` (in reverse order).
   - `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in the modified `a`.

2. **Understanding the Process**:
   - Suppose the original `a` list has `n` elements: `[a1, a2, ..., an]`.
   - The new `a` list is constructed starting from the last element of the original `a` list: `[an]`.
   - The next element in the new `a` list is `an + T[n-1]` (since `T` is accessed in reverse order).
   - This process continues until all elements are added to the new `a` list.

3. **Formulating the New List `a`**:
   - If the original `a` list is `[a1, a2, ..., an]` and `T` is `[t1, t2, ..., tn]`, then the new `a` list will be:
     - Start with `an`.
     - Next element: `an + tn-1`.
     - Continue this pattern: `an + tn-1 + tn-2`, ..., until all elements are included.
   - The new `a` list will thus be: `[an, an + tn-1, an + tn-1 + tn-2, ..., an + tn-1 + ... + t1]`.

4. **Constructing `result`**:
   - `result` is a space-separated string of the elements in the new `a` list.
   - For example, if the new `a` list is `[an, an + tn-1, an + tn-1 + tn-2, ..., an + tn-1 + ... + t1]`, then `result` will be `"an (an + tn-1) (an + tn-1 + tn-2) ... (an + tn-1 + ... + t1)"`.

Given the above explanation, the output will be a space-separated string of the computed elements in the new `a` list.

**Output**: **result (where result is a space-separated string of the elements in the new `a` list constructed as described)**
