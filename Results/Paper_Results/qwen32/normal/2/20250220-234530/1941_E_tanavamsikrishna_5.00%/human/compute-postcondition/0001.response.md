The code reads `n` lines of input, where each line contains `m` integers separated by spaces. These integers are used to populate a 2D list called `rows`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged, but `rows` is now a list of lists containing the input integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= k <= n and 3 <= m and 1 <= d <= m. `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, where each element is an integer read from the input.**
