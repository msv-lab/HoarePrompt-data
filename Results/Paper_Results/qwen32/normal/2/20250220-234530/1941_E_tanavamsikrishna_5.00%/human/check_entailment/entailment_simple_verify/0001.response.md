### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate or if there are any overlooked details that might justify the program's correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to build `k` bridges over consecutive rows of a grid.
- Each bridge spans from the first column to the last column.
- The cost of placing a support at `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`.
- Supports must be placed in the first and last columns.
- The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

#### Analysis of the Program:

##### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - The first loop increments the cost of supports in the first `d-1` positions by 1.
  - The second loop calculates the cost for positions from `d-1` to the end of the row using dynamic programming. It ensures that the cost at each position is the minimum cost of placing a support considering the previous `d` positions plus the cost of placing a support at the current position.

However, the current implementation does not explicitly ensure that supports are placed in the first and last columns. Let's verify this:

- **First Column**: The first column (index 0) is included in the first loop and thus incremented by 1, ensuring a support is placed there.
- **Last Column**: The last column (index `m-1`) is not explicitly handled in the loops. However, since the cost calculation involves considering the minimum cost up to the last column, it implicitly ensures that the last column is included in the final cost calculation.

##### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Read input values, calculate the cost for each row using `func_1`, and find the minimum sum of costs for `k` consecutive rows.
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
  - Reads the grid of depths.
  - Uses `func_1` to calculate the cost for each row.
  - Iterates through the calculated costs to find the minimum sum of costs for `k` consecutive rows.
  - Prints the result.

#### Annotations:
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, confirming that the program reads input, processes each row using `func_1`, and calculates the minimum cost for `k` consecutive rows.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
- **Support Placement in First and Last Columns**: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program should ensure supports are placed in the first and last columns. However, the implementation of `func_1` does indeed place a support in the first column (index 0) by incrementing its cost by 1. The last column is implicitly considered in the dynamic programming approach.
- **Distance Constraint**: The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d` by considering the minimum cost up to the previous `d` positions.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly handle the placement of supports in the first and last columns and respects the distance constraint. The original assessment incorrectly identifies an issue with the placement of supports in the first and last columns, which is actually handled by the current implementation.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it ensures the placement of supports in the first and last columns and respects the distance constraint.

**Final: True**
