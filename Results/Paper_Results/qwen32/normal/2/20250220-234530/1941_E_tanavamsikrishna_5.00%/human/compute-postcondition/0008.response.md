The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `x + 1`.

Given the loop condition, `i` should be `x + 1` and `x + 1` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

Since `costs` is a list of length `n`, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` simplifies to `n - k + 1`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented to `x + 1` and `x + 1` should be less than `n - k + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of rows, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of columns, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bridges, `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum distance between supports such that 1 <= k <= n and 3 <= m and 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n` x `m`, `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of `costs[i:i + k]` for all previously considered slices, plus the newly appended sum `sum(costs[i:i + k])`, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `x + 1 < n - k + 1`**
