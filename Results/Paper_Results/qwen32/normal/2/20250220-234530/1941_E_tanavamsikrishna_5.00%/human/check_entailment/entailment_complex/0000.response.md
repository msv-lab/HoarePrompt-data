### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand whether it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Understanding:
1. **Grid Representation**: The river is represented as an `n x m` grid where `a[i][j]` denotes the depth at cell `(i, j)`.
2. **Bridge Construction**: A bridge can be built across any row `i` from column `1` to `m`. The cost to place a support at `(i, j)` is `a[i][j] + 1`.
3. **Constraints**:
   - Supports must be placed at `(i, 1)` and `(i, m)`.
   - The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
4. **Objective**: Build `k` bridges on consecutive rows such that the total cost is minimized.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
  - This function calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row under the given constraints.
  - It iterates through the row and updates the cost based on the minimum cost of placing supports within the allowed distance `d`.
  - The final cost for the row is the value at the last index of the modified row.
- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - Reads input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`.
  - Reads the grid of depths.
  - Applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of building a bridge on that row.
  - Computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
  - Prints the minimum of these sums.

#### Verification:
- **Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
  - The logic seems correct for calculating the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row while adhering to the constraints.
  - The use of `min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i])` ensures that the cost is calculated considering the minimum cost of placing supports within the allowed distance `d`.
- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - The logic for reading input and processing rows is correct.
  - The calculation of total costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows is correct.
  - Printing the minimum of these sums gives the desired result.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
