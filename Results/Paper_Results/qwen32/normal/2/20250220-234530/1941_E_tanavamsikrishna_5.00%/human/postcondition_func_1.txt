The function reads input values for the number of rows (`n`), columns (`m`), bridges (`k`), and maximum distance between supports (`d`). It processes a 2D list of integers representing rows and calculates a cost for each row using `func_1`. Then, it computes the sum of costs for every possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum of these sums.
