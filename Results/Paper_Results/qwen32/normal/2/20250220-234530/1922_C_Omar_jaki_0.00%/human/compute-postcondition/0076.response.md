To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the expression being printed:

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `a`: This is a list that contains some values followed by `2000000000.0`. The exact values from `first_value_from_r` to `last_value_from_r` are not specified, but the last element is `2000000000.0`.
- `u`: This variable is described as `u - 1`, but since there is no initial value given for `u`, we cannot determine its exact value. However, this does not affect the `print` statement directly.
- `t`: This variable is set to `False`.
- `b`: This is a list `[0, 0, accumulated_values_based_on_conditions]`. The exact value of `accumulated_values_based_on_conditions` is not specified, but it is the third element of the list `b`.
- `c`: This variable holds the value `return_value_1`.
- `d`: This variable holds the value `return_value_2`.

### Expression Analysis:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

Let's analyze the indices used in the list `b`:
- `b[c * 2 - 1]`: Since `b` is a list with three elements, the valid indices are 0, 1, and 2. Therefore, `c * 2 - 1` must result in one of these indices.
- `b[d * 2 - 1]`: Similarly, `d * 2 - 1` must also result in one of these indices.

Given that `b` only has three elements, the possible values for `c` and `d` that would make `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` valid indices are:
- If `c = 1`, then `c * 2 - 1 = 1`.
- If `c = 2`, then `c * 2 - 1 = 3` (which is out of bounds for `b`).
- If `d = 1`, then `d * 2 - 1 = 1`.
- If `d = 2`, then `d * 2 - 1 = 3` (which is out of bounds for `b`).

Therefore, the only feasible values for `c` and `d` are `1`. Let's assume `c = 1` and `d = 1` for the calculation:
- `b[c * 2 - 1]` becomes `b[1]`, which is `0`.
- `b[d * 2 - 1]` becomes `b[1]`, which is `0`.

Thus, the expression `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` simplifies to `0 - 0`, which is `0`.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
