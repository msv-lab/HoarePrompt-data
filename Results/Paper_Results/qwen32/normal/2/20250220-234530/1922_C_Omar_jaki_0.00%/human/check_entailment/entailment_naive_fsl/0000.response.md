Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The program does not explicitly calculate the closest city for each city, which is required to determine the cost of traveling to the closest city using 1 coin. Instead, it seems to be trying to calculate some prefix sums, but these do not directly correspond to the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program calculates values `b` based on some conditions involving distances, but these calculations do not match the logic needed to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin, and traveling directly to another city costs the absolute difference in their positions.

3. **Handling Queries**: The program attempts to handle queries by printing differences from the `b` array, but these differences do not represent the correct minimum cost for traveling between cities according to the problem's rules.

To illustrate the issue, consider the example provided in the problem description:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

The program does not produce this output because it does not correctly compute the minimum cost for each query. For instance, for the first query (traveling from city 1 to city 4), the correct approach involves traveling through the closest cities sequentially, costing 3 coins in total, but the program's logic does not achieve this.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it fails to meet the problem's requirements for calculating the minimum cost of traveling between cities.
