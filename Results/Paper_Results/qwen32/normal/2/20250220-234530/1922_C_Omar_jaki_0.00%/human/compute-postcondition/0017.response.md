To determine what will be printed by the `print(b, 'B')` statement, let's analyze the initial state provided:

Initial State: `[0, 0, v1, v2, ..., vk]`

This initial state describes a list with the following characteristics:
- The list starts with two zeros: `[0, 0]`.
- The rest of the list contains elements `v1, v2, ..., vk`.

However, the variable `b` is not mentioned in the initial state. Since `b` is not explicitly defined or given any value in the initial state, we cannot determine its value from the provided information. Therefore, we must assume that `b` is either undefined or has a value that is not specified in the precondition.

Given this lack of information about `b`, we can only describe the output in terms of `b` itself.

Output: **b B (where b is an undefined or unspecified variable)**

Since `b` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot provide a specific value for it. The output will include the value of `b` followed by the string `'B'`.
