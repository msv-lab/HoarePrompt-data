To determine the new state after the given code executes, let's analyze the provided code snippet:

```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of n+2 integers starting with -1000000000.0, followed by the original n integers, and ending with 2000000000.0.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
- For each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n+2 and x_i ≠ y_i.
- `r` is a lambda function that reads and maps integers from input, and `r()` has been called.
- `b` is a list containing two zeros `[0, 0]`.
- `v` is `y - x`.

Let's break down the code:
- `b[-2]` refers to the second last element of `b`, which is `0` initially.
- `b[-1]` refers to the last element of `b`, which is `0` initially.
- `v ** (v > x - w)` evaluates to `v` if `v > x - w` is `True` (which is `1`), otherwise it evaluates to `1` (since any number to the power of `0` is `1`).
- `v ** (v > z - y)` evaluates to `v` if `v > z - y` is `True` (which is `1`), otherwise it evaluates to `1`.

Since the exact values of `x`, `w`, `z`, and `y` are not provided, we can't determine whether `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` are `True` or `False`. However, we can consider both possibilities.

If `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` are `True`:
- `b += b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v`
- `b += 0 + v, 0 + v`
- `b += v, v`
- `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, v]`

If `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` are `False`:
- `b += b[-2] + 1, b[-1] + 1`
- `b += 0 + 1, 0 + 1`
- `b += 1, 1`
- `b` becomes `[0, 0, 1, 1]`

If one condition is `True` and the other is `False`:
- Let's assume `v > x - w` is `True` and `v > z - y` is `False`:
- `b += b[-2] + v, b[-1] + 1`
- `b += 0 + v, 0 + 1`
- `b += v, 1`
- `b` becomes `[0, 0, v, 1]`

Since the exact conditions are not specified, we'll consider the most general case where the conditions could be either `True` or `False`.

Therefore, the output state considering all possibilities is:
Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n+2 integers starting with -1000000000.0, followed by the original n integers, and ending with 2000000000.0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is a list `[0, 0, v, v]` or `[0, 0, 1, 1]` or `[0, 0, v, 1]` or `[0, 0, 1, v]`, `v` is `y - x`.**
