Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n+2 integers starting with -1000000000.0, followed by the original n integers, and ending with 2000000000.0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n+2 and x_i ≠ y_i; `r` is a lambda function that reads and maps integers from input, and `r()` has been called; `b` is a list containing two zeros `[0, 0]`.
Code of the loop:
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n+2 integers starting with -1000000000.0, followed by the original n integers, and ending with 2000000000.0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `b` is a list `[0, 0, v, v]` or `[0, 0, 1, 1]` or `[0, 0, v, 1]` or `[0, 0, 1, v]`, `v` is `y - x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n+2\) integers starting with \(-1000000000.0\), followed by the original \(n\) integers, and ending with \(2000000000.0\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), `b` is a list `[0, 0, v, v, b[-2] + v

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n+2\) integers starting with \(-1000000000.0\), followed by the original \(n\) integers, and ending with \(2000000000.0\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 10^5\), `b` is `[0, 0, v, v, 2v, v + v




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
