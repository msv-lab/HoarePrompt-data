### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotations provided to ensure we fully understand the logic and correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen.
- The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the result for a single test case.
   - It iterates through each friendship and adds the product of the initial friendship value `f` and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) to the result.
   - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is used because if a pair is chosen `k` times, the contribution to the sum of friendship values is \(f + (f+1) + (f+2) + ... + (f+k-1)\), which simplifies to \(k \cdot f + (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) = k \cdot f + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

#### Annotation Analysis:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points and confirm the logic within the functions. Specifically, the annotation for `func_1` states:
- The result is accumulated as `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for each friendship.

#### Formula Verification:
The formula used in the code is:
\[ \text{contribution} = f \times \left(\frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2}\right) \]

However, the correct formula for the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `f` and ending at `f + k - 1` is:
\[ \text{contribution} = k \times f + \left(\frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2}\right) \]

The discrepancy arises because the code incorrectly uses `k * (k + 1) // 2` instead of `k * (k - 1) // 2`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the formula used in `func_1` is incorrect. The formula `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)` does not correctly represent the sum of the arithmetic series for the friendship values.

Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
