Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the friendship values increase over time if the same pair is chosen again. The current implementation simply multiplies the initial friendship value by the sum of the first k natural numbers, which is incorrect because the friendship value changes after each selection of a friend pair.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Friendship Value Update**: The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time that pair is chosen. The program does not update the friendship values dynamically based on the selections made during the k excursions.

2. **Probability Consideration**: The probability of selecting any specific pair of friends in each excursion is not considered in the current implementation. Since the selection is random and independent, the expected value calculation should take into account the probability of selecting each pair in each excursion.

3. **Modulo Operation**: While the modulo operation is applied, the program does not ensure that the division operation (to get the expected value as a fraction) is handled correctly with modular arithmetic.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider a simple case with:
- `n = 2`, `m = 1`, `k = 2`
- The single friendship pair is `(1, 2)` with an initial friendship value of `f = 1`.

In this case, the expected sum of friendship values over 2 excursions should be calculated as follows:
- In the first excursion, the friendship value is 1.
- In the second excursion, the friendship value is 2 (since it increased by 1 in the first excursion).

So, the total expected sum is `1 + 2 = 3`.

However, the program calculates:
- `result = 1 * (2 * (2 + 1) // 2) % MOD = 1 * 3 % MOD = 3`

While this happens to be correct for this small example due to the specific values, it is not a general solution. For larger values of `k` and more complex scenarios, the program will not correctly account for the increasing friendship values.

To fix the program, we would need to simulate the process of selecting pairs over `k` excursions, updating the friendship values accordingly, and calculating the expected sum correctly using probability and modular arithmetic.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, so the answer is `False`.
