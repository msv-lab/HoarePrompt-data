The given code snippet reads `m` lines of input, where each line contains three integers, and assigns these integers as sublists to the `friendships` list. This means that the `friendships` list will be updated with the new sublists.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers read from the input, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. The `friendships` list has been updated with `m` sublists of three integers each.**
