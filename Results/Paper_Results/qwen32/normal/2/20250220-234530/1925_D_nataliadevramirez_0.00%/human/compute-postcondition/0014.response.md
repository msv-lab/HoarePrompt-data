Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers read from the input, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `result` to the return value of the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`, and `t`) retain their initial values as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
