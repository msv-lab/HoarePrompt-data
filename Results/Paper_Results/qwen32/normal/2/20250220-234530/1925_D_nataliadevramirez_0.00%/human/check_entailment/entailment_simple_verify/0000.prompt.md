You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the friendship values increase over time if the same pair is chosen again. The current implementation simply multiplies the initial friendship value by the sum of the first k natural numbers, which is incorrect because the friendship value changes after each selection of a friend pair.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Friendship Value Update**: The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time that pair is chosen. The program does not update the friendship values dynamically based on the selections made during the k excursions.

2. **Probability Consideration**: The probability of selecting any specific pair of friends in each excursion is not considered in the current implementation. Since the selection is random and independent, the expected value calculation should take into account the probability of selecting each pair in each excursion.

3. **Modulo Operation**: While the modulo operation is applied, the program does not ensure that the division operation (to get the expected value as a fraction) is handled correctly with modular arithmetic.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider a simple case with:
- `n = 2`, `m = 1`, `k = 2`
- The single friendship pair is `(1, 2)` with an initial friendship value of `f = 1`.

In this case, the expected sum of friendship values over 2 excursions should be calculated as follows:
- In the first excursion, the friendship value is 1.
- In the second excursion, the friendship value is 2 (since it increased by 1 in the first excursion).

So, the total expected sum is `1 + 2 = 3`.

However, the program calculates:
- `result = 1 * (2 * (2 + 1) // 2) % MOD = 1 * 3 % MOD = 3`

While this happens to be correct for this small example due to the specific values, it is not a general solution. For larger values of `k` and more complex scenarios, the program will not correctly account for the increasing friendship values.

To fix the program, we would need to simulate the process of selecting pairs over `k` excursions, updating the friendship values accordingly, and calculating the expected sum correctly using probability and modular arithmetic.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, so the answer is `False`.
