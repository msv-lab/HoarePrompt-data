### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided functions to determine if the program correctly implements the solution.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen.
- The result should be given as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \), where \( \frac{p}{q} \) is the expected value in its simplest form.

#### Key Points:
- For each pair of friends, the friendship value increases linearly with the number of times they are chosen.
- The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen out of all possible pairs is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
- However, since the problem simplifies the calculation to the sum of the series of friendship values for each pair, we can use the formula for the sum of the first k natural numbers, which is \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \).

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function iterates over each friendship and multiplies the initial friendship value by the sum of the first k natural numbers, \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \).
- This multiplication is done modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to prevent overflow and ensure the result fits within the required constraints.
- The result is accumulated and returned modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- This function handles input reading and output printing for multiple test cases.
- It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of children, the number of friend pairs, the number of excursions, and the details of each friendship.
- It calls `func_1` to compute the result for each test case and prints the result.

#### Conclusion:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the expected sum of friendship values for each pair of friends by using the sum of the first k natural numbers.
- `func_2` correctly handles input/output operations and ensures that the program processes multiple test cases as specified.

Thus, the program correctly implements the solution as per the problem description.

### Correctness: **True**
