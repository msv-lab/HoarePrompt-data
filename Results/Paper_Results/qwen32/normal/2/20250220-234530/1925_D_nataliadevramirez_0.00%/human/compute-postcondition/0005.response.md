To determine the output of the `print(result)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variables involved:

- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the input.
- `k` is the third integer read from the input.
- `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists, where each sublist contains three integers read from the input.
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `result` is the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

Given this information, we know that `result` is the output of the function `func_1` with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. However, the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`.

Thus, the most precise description we can provide is that the `print(result)` statement will output whatever value is returned by the function `func_1` when called with the specified arguments.

Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships))**
