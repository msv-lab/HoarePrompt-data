The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common placeholder for a loop variable when its value is not used) and `t`, which represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1.

Given the state before the loop starts includes `n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`, and `t`, we need to adjust only `t` to ensure the loop can execute. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `friendships`) do not directly affect the execution of this specific for loop.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of children such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `m` is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), `k` is an integer representing the number of excursions such that 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, and `friendships` is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i representing a pair of friends and their friendship value such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. All pairs of friends are distinct; `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1**.
