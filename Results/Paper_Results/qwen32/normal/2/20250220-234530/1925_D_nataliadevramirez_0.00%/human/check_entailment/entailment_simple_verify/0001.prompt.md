You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions, where the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 every time that pair is chosen. This expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Key Points:
1. **Friendship Value Increase**: Each time a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.
2. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions needs to be computed.
3. **Fraction Representation**: The result should be represented as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and the output is \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - This function calculates the result for a single test case.
  - It iterates through each friendship and adds the product of the initial friendship value `f` and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`) to the result.
  - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is used because if a pair is chosen `k` times, the contribution to the sum of friendship values is \(f + (f+1) + (f+2) + ... + (f+k-1)\), which simplifies to \(k \cdot f + (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) = k \cdot f + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}\).
  - However, the code uses `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which seems incorrect. It should be `k * f + (k * (k - 1) // 2)`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function reads the input for multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - It prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Check:
The main issue with the provided code lies in the calculation inside `func_1`. The formula used for calculating the contribution of each friendship is incorrect. The correct formula should be `k * f + (k * (k - 1) // 2)` instead of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis above, the provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used in `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**
