The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Since `_` does not affect the loop's execution condition, the only state that needs adjustment is `t` itself. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` should be reduced by 1.

State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists where each sublist contains three integers read from the input, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` and has been updated to the value returned by `func_1`.**
