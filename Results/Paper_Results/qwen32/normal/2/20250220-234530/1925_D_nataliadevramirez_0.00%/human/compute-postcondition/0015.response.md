To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet. Here's the breakdown:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the first integer read from the input.
- `m` is the second integer read from the input.
- `k` is the third integer read from the input.
- `friendships` is a list of `m` sublists, where each sublist contains three integers read from the input.
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `result` is the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(result)` statement will output the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the function's return value.

### Final Output:
Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, friendships))**
