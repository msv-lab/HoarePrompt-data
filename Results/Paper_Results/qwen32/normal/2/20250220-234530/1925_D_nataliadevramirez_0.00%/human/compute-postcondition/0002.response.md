The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, and `k` already have specific ranges and meanings, but the code overwrites these values with new inputs.

Here's the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `n` is now the first integer read from the input.
- `m` is now the second integer read from the input.
- `k` is now the third integer read from the input.
- The variable `friendships` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the given code snippet.
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not mentioned in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `friendships` is a list of lists where each sublist contains three integers a_i, b_i, f_i, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.**
