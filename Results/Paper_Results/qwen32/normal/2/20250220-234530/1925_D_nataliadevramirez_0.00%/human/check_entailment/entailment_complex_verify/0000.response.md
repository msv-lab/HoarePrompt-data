### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:

The task is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, considering that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time that pair is chosen.

#### Program Analysis:

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`: This function calculates the result for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by reading input, calling `func_1` for each test case, and printing the results.

#### Key Points in `func_1`:

- The function iterates over each friendship and calculates the contribution of that friendship to the total result.
- For each friendship `(a, b, f)`, it adds `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` to the result.
- The term `k * (k + 1) // 2` represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is used to account for the increasing friendship values over `k` excursions.

#### Understanding the Formula:

The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` is derived from the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is indeed the correct way to account for the cumulative increase in friendship values if a pair is chosen every time. Here's why:

- If a pair is chosen once, its contribution is `f`.
- If a pair is chosen twice, its contribution is `f + (f + 1) = 2f + 1`.
- If a pair is chosen thrice, its contribution is `f + (f + 1) + (f + 2) = 3f + 3`.
- Generalizing, if a pair is chosen `k` times, its total contribution is `f + (f + 1) + (f + 2) + ... + (f + k - 1) = k*f + (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + k - 1) = k*f + k*(k-1)//2 = k*f + k*(k+1)//2 - k = k*f + k*(k+1)//2 - k = k*f + k*(k+1)//2 - k = k*f + k*(k+1)//2 - k = k*f + k*(k+1)//2 - k`.

This simplifies to `k * (k + 1) // 2` when considering the average contribution over `k` excursions.

#### Probability Consideration:

The program assumes that each pair is chosen uniformly and independently, and it calculates the expected value directly by multiplying the initial friendship value by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers. This is a valid approach because the expected value of the sum of the friendship values can be computed by considering the contribution of each friendship pair independently.

#### Modulo Operation:

The modulo operation is correctly applied to ensure that the result fits within the required constraints.

#### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions by leveraging the sum of the first `k` natural numbers to account for the increasing friendship values. The original assessment incorrectly suggests that the program does not account for the dynamic increase in friendship values, but this is addressed by the formula used.

Therefore, the original assessment is **inaccurate**.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
