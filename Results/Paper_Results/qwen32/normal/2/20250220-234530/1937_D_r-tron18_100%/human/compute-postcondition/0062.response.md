To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` given the initial state.

The initial state provides us with the following details:
- `suffZero` is either `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]`.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.

The function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot compute its exact value. However, we can express `zeroInd` in terms of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

Let's break down the possible values for `suffZero` and `ol`:
- If `suffZero` is `[0]`, then `func_1([0], ol)` will depend on the implementation of `func_1`.
- If `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`, then `func_1([0, i + 1], ol)` will also depend on the implementation of `func_1`.

Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we can only express `zeroInd` in terms of the function call.

Therefore, the updated state will include the new variable `zeroInd` calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has length 1 or 2; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`**.
