Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not account for the inversion of the character after the pinball moves, which is a critical part of the problem's rules.

Let's consider a simple test case to illustrate this issue:

### Test Case:
```
1
3
><>
```

### Expected Output:
```
2 1 2
```

### Explanation of Expected Output:
- For `i=1` (pinball starts at the first cell): Pinball moves right to the second cell (time = 1), inverts `>` to `<`, then moves left to the first cell (time = 2), inverts `<` to `>`, and finally moves left out of the grid (time = 3).
- For `i=2` (pinball starts at the second cell): Pinball moves right to the third cell (time = 1), inverts `<` to `>`, then moves right out of the grid (time = 2).
- For `i=3` (pinball starts at the third cell): Pinball moves left to the second cell (time = 1), inverts `>` to `<`, then moves left to the first cell (time = 2), inverts `<` to `>`, and finally moves left out of the grid (time = 3).

However, the provided program does not handle the inversion of characters correctly and thus would likely produce incorrect results for this and other similar test cases.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly simulate the pinball movement and character inversion as per the problem description, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
