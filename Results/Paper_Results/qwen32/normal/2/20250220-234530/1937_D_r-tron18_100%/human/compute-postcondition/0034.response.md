Postcondition: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not), `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not), `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>', `ol` is `totalOne` or `totalOne + 1` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not, `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `el` is '>' or not, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables, and `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>'.**
