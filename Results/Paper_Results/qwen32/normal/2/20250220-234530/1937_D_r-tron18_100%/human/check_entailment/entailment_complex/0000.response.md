### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the functions `func_1` and `func_2` collectively solve the problem as described. The problem requires us to simulate the movement of a pinball on a grid with specific rules and compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:

- **Purpose**: To compute the difference between the last cumulative time and a previous cumulative time based on the offset `times`.
- **Implementation**: The function calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index determined by `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
- **Correctness**: This function appears to correctly compute the required difference, which is essential for determining the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid from a given position.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:

- **Purpose**: To process the string `s1` and compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
- **Implementation**:
  - `pre`: A list of indices where the character is '>'.
  - `totalOne`: The number of '>' characters.
  - `preOne`: Cumulative sums of indices where the character is '>'.
  - `suffZero`: Cumulative sums of indices where the character is '<'.
  - `ans`: The result array storing the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
  - The loop iterates over the string `s1` from right to left, updating `suffZero` and `preOne` based on the character at the current position.
  - Depending on whether the character is '>' or '<', it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums and `func_1`.
- **Correctness**: The implementation seems complex but appears to correctly handle the logic of simulating the pinball's movement and computing the required times. The use of cumulative sums and the `func_1` function to compute differences suggests that the implementation is designed to efficiently handle large inputs within the constraints.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, both functions appear to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The use of cumulative sums and efficient computation of differences ensures that the solution can handle the upper limits of the input size efficiently.

**Correctness: True**
