The given code snippet initializes a new list `suffZero` with a single element, which is `0`. This operation does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`). Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `suffZero` list.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the string `s1` such that `n = len(s1)`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning; `suffZero` is `[0]`.**
