To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet within the context of the provided initial state.

The code snippet modifies the `ans` list at index `i` using the expression `zeroInd - oneInd`. Let's break down the components:

- `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1([0], totalOne)`.
- `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided initial state or code snippet. Without knowing what `func_1` does, we cannot compute the exact values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume `func_1` returns a value that allows us to proceed with the calculation.

Given that `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are expressions involving `totalOne` and `preOne`, and assuming `func_1` returns a consistent value, we can express the new value of `ans[i]` in terms of these variables.

Let's denote:
- `func_1([0], totalOne)` as `val1`
- `func_1(preOne, 1)` as `val2`

Then:
- `zeroInd = 2 * val1`
- `oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - val2`

Thus, `ans[i]` becomes:
- `ans[i] = 2 * val1 - (2 * preOne[-1] - val2) = 2 * val1 - 2 * preOne[-1] + val2`

Since the exact values of `val1` and `val2` are not specified, we will represent the final state in terms of these expressions.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `2 * func_1([0], totalOne) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is currently '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1([0], totalOne)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**

In simpler terms, the value at `ans[i]` is now computed as `2 * func_1([0], totalOne) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
