To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

Given:
- `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`.
- `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning.
- `suffZero` is `[0]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is currently '>'.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is 0.
- `ol` is greater than `zr`.
- `zeroInd` is 0.

Code Snippet:
```python
oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
```

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we'll assume that `func_1` is a function that retrieves the value from the `preOne` list at the specified index. 

Let's proceed with the assumption that `func_1(lst, idx)` returns `lst[idx]`.

Given `zr` is 0, the expression `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` translates to `preOne[0] + preOne[1]`.

Since `preOne` starts with 0 and the subsequent elements are cumulative sums of the indices in `pre`, we know:
- `preOne[0]` is 0.
- `preOne[1]` is the first element in `pre` (since it's a cumulative sum starting from 0).

Therefore, `oneInd` will be `0 + pre[0]`, which is simply `pre[0]`.

The only variable that changes here is `oneInd`, which is set to the value of `pre[0]`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is currently '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `ol` is greater than `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `pre[0]`.**
