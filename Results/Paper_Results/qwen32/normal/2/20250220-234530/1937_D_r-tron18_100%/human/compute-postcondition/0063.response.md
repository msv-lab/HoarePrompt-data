Given the code snippet and the initial state, let's determine the output state:

The code snippet provided is:
```python
oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
```

This line calculates the value of `oneInd` using the last element of `preOne` and the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `oneInd` is calculated and assigned a new value.
- All other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly involved in the calculation of `oneInd`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, we'll assume it returns a value based on its parameters, but we don't have enough information to determine what exactly `func_1(preOne, 1)` evaluates to. However, we can express `oneInd` in terms of `preOne[-1]` and `func_1(preOne, 1)`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the new value of `oneInd` while keeping all other variables as they were described in the initial state.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has length 1 or 2; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.
