To determine the new state after the given code snippet is executed, let's break down the changes:

Given Code Snippet:
```python
oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
```

### Analysis:
- `preOne[-1]`: This refers to the last element of the list `preOne`.
- `func_1(preOne, 1)`: This calls a function `func_1` with `preOne` and `1` as arguments. The exact behavior of `func_1` is not provided, so we'll represent its result symbolically.

### Impact on Variables:
- `oneInd` is updated based on the calculation `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

### Remaining Variables:
- All other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `fi`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified in the code snippet.

### Output State:
Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]`; `zeroInd` and `fi` are determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables; `el` is the first character of `s1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**

This output state reflects the updated value of `oneInd` while keeping all other variables as they were initially described.
