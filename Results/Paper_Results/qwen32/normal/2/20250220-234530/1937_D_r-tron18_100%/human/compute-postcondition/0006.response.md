The given code snippet assigns the character at index `i` of the string `s1` to the variable `el`. This operation does not affect the values of `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, or `ans`. The only new variable introduced is `el`, which holds the character from `s1` at the specified index.

Since the value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact character that `el` will hold, but we know it will be either '<' or '>', based on the definition of `s1`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'**.
