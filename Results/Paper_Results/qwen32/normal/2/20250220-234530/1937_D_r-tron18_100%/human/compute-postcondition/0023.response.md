The code appends a new value to the `suffZero` list. This new value is calculated as the last element of `suffZero` plus `i` plus 1. Since `suffZero` initially contains only one element, which is `0`, the new value appended will be `0 + i + 1`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning, `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'. `el` is not '>'**.
