The given code snippet is `preOne.pop()`. This operation removes the last element from the list `preOne`.

Given the initial state, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning. After executing `preOne.pop()`, the last element of `preOne` is removed.

Here's the updated state:

- `s1` remains a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`.
- `pre` remains a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` remains adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not.
- `preOne` now has its last element removed.
- `suffZero` remains `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not.
- `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined as follows: if `ol <= zr`, `ans[i]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`; otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has length 1 or 2; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` if `ol <= zr`, or `0` if `suffZero` is `[0]`, or `2 * (i + 1)` if `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr`, or `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` has its last element removed; `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined as follows: if `ol <= zr`, `ans[i]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`; otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has length 1 or 2; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` if `ol <= zr`, or `0` if `suffZero` is `[0]`, or `2 * (i + 1)` if `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr`, or `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr`.**
