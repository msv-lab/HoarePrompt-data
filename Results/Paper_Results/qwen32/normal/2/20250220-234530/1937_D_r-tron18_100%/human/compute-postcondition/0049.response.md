The given code snippet appends a new value to the `suffZero` list. Specifically, it adds the last element of `suffZero` plus `i + 1` to `suffZero`. Given that `i` is 0 (as `el` is the first character of `s1`), the new value appended to `suffZero` will be `suffZero[-1] + 0 + 1`, which simplifies to `suffZero[-1] + 1`.

Since `suffZero` is initially `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` (which would be `[0, 1]` if `i` were not 0), and given that `i` is 0, `suffZero` starts as `[0]`. After executing the code, `suffZero` becomes `[0, 1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not), `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not), `suffZero` is `[0, 1]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables, `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>', `ol` is `totalOne` or `totalOne + 1` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not, `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `el` is '>' or not, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are determined based on the conditions involving `zr`, `ol`, and other variables, and `fi` is a value derived from `preOne` and `zr` when `el` is '>', `i` is 0; `el` is the first character of `s1`**
