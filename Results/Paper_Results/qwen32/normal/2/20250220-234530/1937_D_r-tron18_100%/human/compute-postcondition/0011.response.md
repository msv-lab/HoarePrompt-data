To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given:
- `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`.
- `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning.
- `suffZero` is `[0]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is currently '>'.
- `ol` is equal to `totalOne`.
- `zr` is 0.
- `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1([0], totalOne)`.

The code snippet:
```python
oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
```

Here, `oneInd` is being calculated based on the last element of `preOne` and the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we'll assume it returns a value that can be determined based on the context.

Let's denote `func_1(preOne, 1)` as `f_val`.

Thus, the new value of `oneInd` would be:
```python
oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - f_val
```

Since the exact value of `f_val` is not specified, we can only express `oneInd` in terms of `preOne[-1]` and `f_val`.

The variables `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, and `zeroInd` remain unchanged except for the newly calculated `oneInd`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is currently '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1([0], totalOne)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.
