To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and how it affects the variables.

Given Code Snippet:
```python
fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
```

This line calculates the difference between two calls to `func_1` with different arguments and assigns the result to `fi`.

### Analysis:
- `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning.
- `zr` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has length 1 or 2.
- `func_1` is a function that presumably takes `preOne` and an index and returns some value based on these inputs.

### Impact on Variables:
- The variable `fi` is newly introduced and is assigned the result of the subtraction `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- All other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `ol`, `zr`, `el`, `i`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`) remain unchanged by this single line of code.

### Output State:
The only change is the introduction of the variable `fi` with its calculated value.

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning (adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not); `suffZero` is `[0]` or `[0, i + 1]` depending on whether `el` is '>' or not; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the value of `el` and other variables; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `suffZero` has length 1 or 2; `el` is the character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>'; `i` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `zeroInd` is `0` if `suffZero` is `[0]`, or `2 * (i + 1)` if `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**.
