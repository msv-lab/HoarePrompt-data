Postcondition: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`; `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning; `suffZero` is `[0, i + 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is determined based on the condition: if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `ans[i]` is `i + 2 + n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1) - 2 * preOne[-1]`; `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is either '<' or '>', and `el` is not '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is 1; `zeroInd` is determined based on the condition: if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `i + 1`, otherwise `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`; `oneInd` is determined based on the condition: if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, otherwise `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.**
