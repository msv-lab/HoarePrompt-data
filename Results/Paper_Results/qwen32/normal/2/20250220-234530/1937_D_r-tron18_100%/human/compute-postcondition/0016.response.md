To determine the new state after executing the given line of code, we need to focus on the impact of the operation `oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)`.

Given:
- `oneInd` is initially set to `pre[0]`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning.

The function `func_1(preOne, 1)` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot know its exact behavior. However, we can infer that it likely returns some value based on `preOne` and the argument `1`.

For the sake of this task, let's assume `func_1(preOne, 1)` returns a specific value, say `k`. This means `oneInd` will be updated to `oneInd - k`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we'll represent the updated `oneInd` as `pre[0] - k`.

Therefore, the Output State would be:

Output State: **`s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 1`, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element at index `i` is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0 at the beginning, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `el` is a character from `s1` at index `i` which is currently '>', `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is 0, `ol` is greater than `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `pre[0] - k`.**

Here, `k` represents the value returned by `func_1(preOne, 1)`.
