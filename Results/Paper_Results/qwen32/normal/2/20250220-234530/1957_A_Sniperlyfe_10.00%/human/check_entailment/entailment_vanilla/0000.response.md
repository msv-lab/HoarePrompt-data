Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks, where:
- Each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick.
- No stick can be used in more than one polygon.
- Regular polygons can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3 (triangle being the smallest).

### Key Points:
1. **Minimum Sides for a Polygon**: The smallest polygon is a triangle, which requires at least 3 sticks of the same length.
2. **Counting Polygons**: For a given stick length, the number of polygons that can be formed is determined by how many complete sets of sticks of that length we can make. For example, if we have 8 sticks of the same length, we can form 2 squares (each square requiring 4 sticks).
3. **General Formula**: For a stick length that appears `v` times, the number of polygons that can be formed is `v // k`, where `k` is the minimum number of sticks required to form a polygon (which is 3). However, the provided code uses `v // 4`, implying it assumes the minimum polygon is a square (4 sides).

### Code Analysis:
The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the number of polygons:
- It creates a frequency dictionary `freq` to count occurrences of each stick length.
- It then calculates the number of polygons by summing up `v // 4` for each value `v` in the frequency dictionary.

### Issues with the Code:
- **Incorrect Minimum Polygon Size**: The code incorrectly assumes that the smallest polygon is always a square (4 sides). This is not true; the smallest polygon is a triangle (3 sides).
- **Logic Error**: By using `v // 4`, the code will underestimate the number of polygons that can be formed, especially when there are sticks that could form triangles but not squares.

### Conclusion:
Given the logic error in the code, it does not correctly solve the problem as described. The code should use `v // 3` instead of `v // 4` to account for the smallest possible polygon (a triangle).

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
