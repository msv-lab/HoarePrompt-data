Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` in the list represents the number of test cases. Each subsequent test case consists of an integer `n` indicating the number of sticks, followed by `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. The function returns the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique stick length by 4 across all test cases.**
