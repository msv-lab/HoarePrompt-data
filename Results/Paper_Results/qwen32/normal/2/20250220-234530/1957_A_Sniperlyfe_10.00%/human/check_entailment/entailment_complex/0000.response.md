### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks, where each polygon must have equal sides and no stick can be reused. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the `func_1` function.

The function `func_1` currently calculates the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of each unique stick length by 4. This approach assumes that the only polygons being considered are squares (since it divides by 4). However, the problem statement specifies that we need to find the maximum number of regular polygons of any number of sides, not just squares.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should consider all possible regular polygons (triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.) and determine the maximum number of such polygons that can be formed. This involves checking for each unique stick length how many polygons of different sizes (3 sides, 4 sides, etc.) can be formed and keeping track of the total number of polygons.

Given the current implementation, it will only correctly count the number of squares that can be formed, which is insufficient to solve the problem as described.
