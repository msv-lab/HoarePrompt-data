Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements where the first element of each pair n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of sticks in the corresponding test case, and the next n elements are integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks; freq is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for n in arr:
    freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements where the first element of each pair `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of sticks in the corresponding test case, and the next `n` elements are integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks; `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `n` incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements where the first element of each pair `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of sticks in the corresponding test case, and the next `n` elements are integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks; `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `n` incremented by 1; `n` is the next value in `arr` after the current `n` and its corresponding stick lengths.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements where the first element of each pair `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of sticks in the corresponding test case, and the next `n` elements are integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks; `freq` is a dictionary with the count of `n` incremented by 1; `n` is the next value in `arr` after the current test case's stick lengths.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
