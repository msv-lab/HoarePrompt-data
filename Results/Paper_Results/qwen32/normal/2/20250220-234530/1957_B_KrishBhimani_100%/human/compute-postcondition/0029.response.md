The code snippet appends a specific value to the list `ans`. This value is calculated as \((1 << i) - 1\), which is equivalent to \(2^i - 1\). Here, \(i\) is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans`, as it now contains one element, which is \(2^i - 1\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the single element \(2^i - 1\); `temp` is the highest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).**
