The given code appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length matches `n`. Since `ans` initially contains two elements, the number of zeros appended will be `n - 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing `n` elements, where the first two elements are `[(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1)]` and the remaining `n-2` elements are `0`; `temp` is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`; `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled to reach its final value.**
