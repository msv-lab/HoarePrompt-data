In this case, the `while` loop is defined as `while True:`, which means it will always execute as long as it is not explicitly broken out of. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute one more time. The loop condition is inherently satisfied, and the loop will continue indefinitely unless there is a break condition inside the loop body (which is omitted here).

Thus, the state remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list. If `temp * 2` was less than `k` initially, then `temp` is set to 4 and `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `temp` remains 1 and `i` remains 0.**
