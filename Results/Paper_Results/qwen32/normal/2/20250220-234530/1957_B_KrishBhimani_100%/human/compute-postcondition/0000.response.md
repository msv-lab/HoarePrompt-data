In the given task, the for loop iterates based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the function `input()`. Since the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to run at least once.

Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. The variables `n` and `k` mentioned in the problem description are used within the loop body, which we are not concerned with for this task. We only need to focus on ensuring that the loop can start executing.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

Since the problem specifies that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we can simply confirm that `t` meets this condition. No other variables in the loop head need adjustment because the loop head only involves `t` indirectly through `input()`.

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
