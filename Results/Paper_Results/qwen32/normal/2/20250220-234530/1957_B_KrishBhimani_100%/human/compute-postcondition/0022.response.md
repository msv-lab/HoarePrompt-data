Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 1, 2, or 4; `i` is either 0 or 1. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `temp` is doubled and `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, `temp * 2` is greater than or equal to `k` and `i` remains 0.**
