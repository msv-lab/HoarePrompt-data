The given code appends a specific value to the list `ans`. This value is calculated as \((1 \ll i) - 1\), where \(1 \ll i\) represents a bitwise left shift operation, effectively computing \(2^i\). Thus, \((1 \ll i) - 1\) computes \(2^i - 1\).

Given that `i` is the exponent of the highest power of 2 less than `k`, the value being appended to `ans` is \(2^i - 1\).

Here's the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `l1` remains a list of strings obtained from the new input.
- `n` remains the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` remains the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `arr` remains an empty list.
- `k0` remains equal to `k`.
- `ans` now contains one element, which is \(2^i - 1\).
- `temp` remains the highest power of 2 less than `k`.
- `i` remains the exponent of this power of 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the single element \(2^i - 1\); `temp` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`; `i` is the exponent of this power of 2.**
