The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was initially either 0, 1, or 2, after the increment, `i` will be either 1, 2, or 3 respectively. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is either 2, 4, or 8; `i` is either 1, 2, or 3.**
