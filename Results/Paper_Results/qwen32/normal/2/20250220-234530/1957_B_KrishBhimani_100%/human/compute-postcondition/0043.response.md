In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least once regardless of the current state of any variables. Therefore, no modifications are necessary to ensure that the loop executes the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the new input; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is 1; `i` is 0**
