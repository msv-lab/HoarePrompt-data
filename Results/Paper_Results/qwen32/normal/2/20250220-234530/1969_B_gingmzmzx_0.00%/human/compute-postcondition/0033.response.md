The code snippet checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. If true, it increments `ans` by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 element
- `n` is `n-1`
- `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`
- `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`
- `ans` is 0
- `c` is 0

If `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` will be incremented by 1. Since `cnt` can only be `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `cnt[1]` can either be 0 or 1. Therefore, `ans` will be 1 if `cnt` is `[0, 1]`, and 0 if `cnt` is `[1, 0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 element, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `ans` is 1 if `cnt` is `[0, 1]` else 0, `c` is 0**
