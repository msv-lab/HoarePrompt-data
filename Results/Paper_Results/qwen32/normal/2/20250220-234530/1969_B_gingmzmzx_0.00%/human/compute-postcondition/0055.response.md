The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is initialized as `[0, 0]`. Therefore, the value at index `c` (which can be either 0 or 1) will be incremented by 1.

If `c` is 0, `cnt` will become `[1, 0]`.
If `c` is 1, `cnt` will become `[0, 1]`.

Since the value of `c` is not specified, we consider both possibilities. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input and must contain at least one element, `n` is `n + 1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `ans` is 0**.
