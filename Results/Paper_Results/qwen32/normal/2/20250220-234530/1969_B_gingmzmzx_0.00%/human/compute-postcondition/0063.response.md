Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input and contains at least one element, `n` is `n + 1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is updated to `[2, 0]` if `cnt` was `[1, 0]` and `c` is `0`, or `[1, 1]` if `cnt` was `[1, 0]` and `c` is `1`, or `[1, 1]` if `cnt` was `[0, 1]` and `c` is `0`, or `[0, 2]` if `cnt` was `[0, 1]` and `c` is `1`, `c` is the next element in the list `s`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` increases by 1 if the second element of `cnt` (i.e., `cnt[1]`) is greater than 0. All other variables retain their previously described states.
