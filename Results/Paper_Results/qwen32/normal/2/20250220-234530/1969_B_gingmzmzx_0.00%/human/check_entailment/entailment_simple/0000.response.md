### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to calculate the minimum total cost to sort a binary string `s` in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift is defined as the length of the substring being shifted.

The provided program calculates the answer by iterating through the string and maintaining a count of zeros and ones encountered so far. It uses this information to determine the cost of making the string sorted.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `zeroes` counts the total number of zeros in the string.
   - `cnt` is a list that keeps track of the number of zeros and ones encountered so far.
   - `ans` accumulates the total cost.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each character `c` in the string:
     - Increment the corresponding count in `cnt`.
     - If `c` is `0`, add `1` to `ans` if there have been any `1`s encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`). This is because a `0` needs to be moved past all previously seen `1`s to achieve a sorted order.
     - If `c` is `1`, add the number of remaining zeros (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`. This accounts for the fact that this `1` needs to be moved past all remaining `0`s to achieve a sorted order.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing the entire string, `ans` contains the minimum total cost to sort the string.

The logic correctly calculates the cost based on the relative positions of `0`s and `1`s in the string. The key insight is that the cost is determined by how many times `0`s need to be moved past `1`s and vice versa.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
