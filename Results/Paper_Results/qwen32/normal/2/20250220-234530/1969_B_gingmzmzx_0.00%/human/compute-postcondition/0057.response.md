The code snippet increments `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Given that `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `cnt[1]` can either be 0 or 1. Therefore, `ans` will be incremented by 1 if `cnt` is `[0, 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a new list of integers derived from the input and contains at least one element, `n` is `n + 1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the new list `s`, `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `ans` is 1 if `cnt` is `[0, 1]` else `ans` is 0, and `c` is 0**.
