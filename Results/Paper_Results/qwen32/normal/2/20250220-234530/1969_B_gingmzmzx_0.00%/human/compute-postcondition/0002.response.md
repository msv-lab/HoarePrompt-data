The given code snippet converts the binary string `s` into a list of integers. Here's the impact of the code on the program:

- `s` is originally a binary string.
- The code converts each character of the string `s` to an integer using `map(int, input().strip())` and stores the result back in `s`.

After the execution of the code, `s` will be a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `s` is 2 ≤ len(s) ≤ 2 · 10^5, `n` must be greater than 0.**
