Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and the length of `s` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1. If `c` is 0, `ans` is updated to its current value plus (`zeroes - cnt[0]`). If `c` is 1, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1] > 0`.**
