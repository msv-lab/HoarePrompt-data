Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but is expected to handle `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a binary string `s` with a length between 2 and 200,000. For each test case, the function processes the binary string `s` and returns a result based on the properties of `s`. The total length of all binary strings across all test cases does not exceed 200,000.**
