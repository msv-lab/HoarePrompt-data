### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s`. However, this approach is flawed because simply counting and removing "map" and "pie" does not necessarily give the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:
1. **Counting and Removing Substrings**: The program counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and sums them up. However, removing one occurrence of "map" might create another "pie" or vice versa, which means the actual deletions needed could be less than the sum of these counts.
2. **No Overlapping Consideration**: The program does not consider overlapping substrings or the possibility that removing one character could resolve multiple occurrences of "map" or "pie".
3. **Greedy Approach**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions, which is a more complex task than just counting non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie".

### Example:
Consider the string "mpimap". The program would count one "map" and one "pie", resulting in a total of 2 deletions. However, by removing just one character ('m'), we can make the string beautiful ("piap" -> "iap"), which requires only 1 deletion.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
