The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads a new integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to whatever integer the user inputs. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the newly input integer; `s` is the new input string with all 'map' substrings removed; `m` is 0; `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified `s`; `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**.
