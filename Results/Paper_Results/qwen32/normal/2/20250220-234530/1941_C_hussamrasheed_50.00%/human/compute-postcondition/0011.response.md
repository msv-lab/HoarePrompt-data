The code snippet updates the value of `m` to be the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the new input string; `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in `s`; `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `m` has been updated to reflect the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`. All other variables retain their previous values.
