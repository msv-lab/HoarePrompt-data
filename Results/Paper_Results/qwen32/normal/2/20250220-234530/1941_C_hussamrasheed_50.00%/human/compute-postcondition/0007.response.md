To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This represents the number of test cases, but it does not affect the calculation for a single instance of `s`, `m`, and `p`.
- `n` is an input integer, but its role is not specified in the context of the variables `s`, `m`, and `p`.
- `s` is the original string with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
- `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`.
- `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the original `s`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(m + p)
```

This line calculates the sum of `m` and `p` and prints the result. Here, `m` is the count of the substring 'map' in the original string, and `p` is the count of the substring 'pie' in the original string. Since `s` is the original string with all occurrences of 'map' removed, the value of `m` does not change the fact that it was originally counted from the string before removal.

Thus, the output will be the sum of the number of times 'map' appeared in the original string and the number of times 'pie' appeared in the original string.

Output: **m + p (where m is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original string and p is the number of times 'pie' appeared in the original string)**
