To determine what will be printed by the `print(m + p)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **t**: An input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations but does not directly affect the calculation of `m + p` for a single iteration.
2. **n**: A newly input integer. This variable is not used in the calculation of `m + p`.
3. **s**: A newly input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed. This means the original string had some occurrences of 'map', which were deleted to form this new string.
4. **m**: The number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`. This is a count of how many times the substring 'map' was found in the original string.
5. **p**: The number of times 'pie' appears in the modified `s`. This is a count of how many times the substring 'pie' was found in the string after all occurrences of 'map' were removed.
6. **i**: The current value of `i` plus 1. This variable is not used in the calculation of `m + p`.

The `print(m + p)` statement will output the sum of `m` and `p`. Here's the breakdown of these variables:
- `m` is the count of 'map' in the original string.
- `p` is the count of 'pie' in the modified string (after removing all 'map').

Since the exact string `s` and its modifications are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `m` and `p`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of these counts.

Output: **m + p (where m is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original string, and p is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified string after removing all 'map')**
