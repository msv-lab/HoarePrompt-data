The code updates the value of `p` to be the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the modified string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the newly input integer; `s` is the newly input string with all occurrences of 'map' removed; `m` is the number of times 'map' appeared in the original `s`; `p` is the number of times 'pie' appears in the modified `s`; `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**.
