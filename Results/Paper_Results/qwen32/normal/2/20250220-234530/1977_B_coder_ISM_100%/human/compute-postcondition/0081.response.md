To determine the output of the `print(*s)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable represents the number of test cases but does not directly influence the content of `s`.
- `x` is an input integer. The specific value of `x` is not relevant to the current print statement.
- `s` is a list of strings. Each string in this list has undergone a transformation where all occurrences of `'1'` immediately followed by `'-1'` have been changed to `'-1'` followed by `'0'`.

Given the transformation applied to the list `s`, the `print(*s)` statement will print each string in the list `s` separated by spaces. Since the exact contents of `s` are not specified beyond the transformation rule, we cannot provide the exact strings. However, we can describe the output based on the transformation rule applied.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The list `s` contains strings.
2. Each string in `s` has had all occurrences of `'1-1'` replaced with `'-10'`.
3. The `*s` in the `print` function unpacks the list `s`, printing each string in the list separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be the strings in the list `s` after the specified transformation, separated by spaces.

Output: **strings in the list `s` after replacing all occurrences of `'1-1'` with `'-10'`, separated by spaces**.
