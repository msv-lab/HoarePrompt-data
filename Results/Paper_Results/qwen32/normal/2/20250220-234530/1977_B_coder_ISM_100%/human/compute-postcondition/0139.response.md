The code snippet modifies the 30th element (index 29) of the list `s` to '1'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` with the 30th element set to '1', `flag` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is incremented by 1.**
