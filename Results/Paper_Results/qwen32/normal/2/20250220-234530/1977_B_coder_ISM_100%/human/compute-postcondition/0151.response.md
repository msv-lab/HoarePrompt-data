Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` where the 30th element is '0', `flag` is not 0, and `length` is 31. If `s[i]` was originally '-1' and `s[i - 1]` was '1', then the `i`th element of `s` is now '0' and the `i-1`th element of `s` is '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s`.**
