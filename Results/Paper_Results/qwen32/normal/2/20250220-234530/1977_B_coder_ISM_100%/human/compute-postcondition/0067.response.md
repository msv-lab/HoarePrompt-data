Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of strings where consecutive `'1'`s have been replaced with `'-1'` followed by `'0'`s, and any `'0'` encountered when `flag` is 1 has been flipped to `'1'`. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is `'0'`, then `s` has 31 strings with `s[29]` being `'0'` and `s[30]` being `'1'`, and `length` is 32. Otherwise, `s` has 30 strings, `length` is 30, and `flag` remains 0. Additionally, `s[i]` is `'-1'` and `s[i - 1]` is `'1'`.**
