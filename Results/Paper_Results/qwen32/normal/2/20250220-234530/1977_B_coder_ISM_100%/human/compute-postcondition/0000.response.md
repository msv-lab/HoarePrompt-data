`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is now the integer value read from the input. The precondition for `t` (that it is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is still valid after the code has been executed. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
