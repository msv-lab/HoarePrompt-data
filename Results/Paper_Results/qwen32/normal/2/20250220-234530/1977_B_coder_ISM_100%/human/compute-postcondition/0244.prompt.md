Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list of strings where all occurrences of `'1'` immediately followed by `'-1'` have been transformed into `'-1'` followed by `'0'`. The values of `flag` and `length` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing the 30-bit binary representation of `x` where the 30th element is '0', `flag` is not 0, and `length` is 31. After 30 iterations, `s` may have been modified based on the conditions `(s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1')`, resulting in some elements being changed to '0' and their preceding elements being changed to '-1'. `nalla` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, so `nalla` is 31.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 32 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a list of characters where no '-1' follows a '1', `flag` is either 0 or 1, `length` is either 30 or 31, and `nalla` is 32.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
