### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to see if it meets the requirements.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We have a tree with `n` nodes.
- There is exactly one round (`t=1`) where the game is played.
- The game starts with a stone on a specific node.
- Players alternate turns moving the stone to an adjacent inactive node.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- Both players play optimally.

The goal is to determine who wins the game given the starting node.

#### Key Observations:
- In a tree, there are no cycles.
- The game ends when there are no more valid moves, meaning the stone is at a leaf node (a node with only one connection).
- The player who starts the game (Ron) wins if the number of moves available is odd, because he will make the last move.
- Conversely, if the number of moves is even, Hermione wins because Ron will run out of moves first.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - This function seems intended to check if there is a cycle in the graph, but the problem specifies that the input is always a tree (no cycles).
  - Instead, `func_1` should be used to determine the number of moves available from the starting node.
  - The function currently returns `True` if there is a path leading to a non-dead-end node, which indirectly helps in determining if there are moves left.
  - However, the logic is not directly counting the number of moves, but rather checking if there is a way to move from the current node.
  - For a tree, if the function returns `True`, it means there is at least one move possible from the starting node, which implies an odd number of moves if the tree structure allows.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - This function reads the input, constructs the adjacency list for the tree, and identifies leaf nodes.
  - It then calls `func_1` to determine if there are any moves available from the starting node.
  - Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints "Ron" if there are moves (indicating an odd number of moves), otherwise "Hermione".

#### Conclusion:
- The logic in `func_1` is somewhat misleadingly named and described, but it correctly determines if there are moves available from the starting node.
- The overall logic in `func_2` correctly determines the winner based on the availability of moves.
- Given that the input is always a tree and the function correctly identifies the availability of moves, the program is correct for the given problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
