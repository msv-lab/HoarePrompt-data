### Reasoning:

The given problem involves determining the winner of a game played on a tree structure, where the players take turns moving a stone along the edges of the tree. The player who cannot make a move loses. The game is played optimally by both players.

The program provided consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a breakdown of how these functions work and whether they correctly solve the problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is a recursive function that determines whether the player whose turn it is can force a win from a given starting node.
   - It checks if the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has only one neighbor, which is the parent node). If so, it returns `False` because the player cannot make a move.
   - For each non-parent neighbor of the current node, it recursively calls itself to determine if the opponent can force a win from that neighbor. It stores the negation of these results in the `distances` list.
   - Finally, it returns `True` if there is any neighbor from which the opponent cannot force a win (i.e., any element in `distances` is `True`), indicating that the current player can force a win.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, constructs the tree as an adjacency list using a `defaultdict`, and identifies all the leaf nodes.
   - It reads the starting node for the game.
   - It calls `func_1` with the starting node to determine if the first player (Ron) can force a win.
   - Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints "Ron" if he can force a win, otherwise it prints "Hermione".

### Analysis:

- The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the strategy of checking if the current player can force a win by exploring all possible moves and considering the optimal play of the opponent.
- The base case of `func_1` correctly handles the scenario where the current node is a leaf.
- The recursive calls in `func_1` correctly explore all possible moves and use the results to determine the best move for the current player.
- The main function `func_2` correctly reads the input, constructs the tree, and uses `func_1` to determine the winner.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the provided input and the rules of the game.

**Correctness: True**
