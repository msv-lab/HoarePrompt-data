Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is `t - 1` (This implies that `t` was initially some integer value, but it is decremented by 1).
- `n` is the new integer value of the user input.
- `s` is the new value of the user input (likely a string, given the context of counting '1's).
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`) are used in this particular `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is always `'YES'`, regardless of the values of the other variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
