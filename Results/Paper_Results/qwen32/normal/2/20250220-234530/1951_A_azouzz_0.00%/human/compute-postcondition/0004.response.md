The code snippet `cnt1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. This operation does not affect the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, or `s`; it only introduces a new variable `cnt1` with the count of '1's in `s`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the value of the user input, `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.**
