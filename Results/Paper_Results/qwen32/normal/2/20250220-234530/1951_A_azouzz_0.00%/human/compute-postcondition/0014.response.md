The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides various conditions and variable definitions, but none of these affect the content of the `print` statement itself. The string `'YES'` is explicitly specified and does not depend on any of the variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`) mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the code is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
