Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the integer value of the user input; `s` is the new value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`. Whether '11' is in `s` or not, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged.**
