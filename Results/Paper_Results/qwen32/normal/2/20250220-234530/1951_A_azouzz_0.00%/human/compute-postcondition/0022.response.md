Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is the integer value of the user input.
- `s` is the new value of the user input.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
