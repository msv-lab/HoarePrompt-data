Reasoning:
The provided problem description and the given program do not match. The problem description describes a Python script that scans through subdirectories within the current working directory, checks if their names fall within a specified numeric range, and then generates two new files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in those directories. 

On the other hand, the given program defines a function `func_1()` that reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s`. It then counts the occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s` and prints "YES" or "NO" based on certain conditions related to the count of '1's and the presence of "11" in the string.

Since the functionality described in the problem statement does not align with the code provided, the program cannot be considered correct for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
