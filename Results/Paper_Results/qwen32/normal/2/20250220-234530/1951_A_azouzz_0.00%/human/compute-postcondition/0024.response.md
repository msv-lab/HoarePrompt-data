The `print('NO')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`) described in the initial state. The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided within the `print` function.

Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
