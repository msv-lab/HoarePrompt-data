The code snippet `s = input()` assigns the value of user input to the variable `s`. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the value of the user input.**
