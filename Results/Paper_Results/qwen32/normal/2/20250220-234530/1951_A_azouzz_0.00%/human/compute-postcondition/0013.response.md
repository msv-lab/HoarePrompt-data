Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the value of the user input, `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. Additionally, either `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2, or `cnt1` is even. The substring '11' is not present in `s`.**
