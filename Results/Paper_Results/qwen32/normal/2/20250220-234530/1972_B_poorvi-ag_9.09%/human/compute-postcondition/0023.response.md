The code snippet provided reassigns the value of `n` to be the integer value of the next input. This means the previous value of `n` is overwritten by the new input integer. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
