Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".**

Explanation: The variable `t` is reassigned to the value of the integer input. The conditions on `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state description and are not affected by the given code snippet.
