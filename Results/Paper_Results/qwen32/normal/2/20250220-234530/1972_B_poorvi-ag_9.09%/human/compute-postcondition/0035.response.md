In the given for loop, the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. The loop variable `i` takes on the value of each element in the `results` list during each iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `results` is a list of length `t` where `t` must be greater than 0, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`.

The loop head only contains the variable `i`, which is used to iterate over the elements of `results`. Since `i` is just an alias for each element in `results`, adjusting `i` does not affect the state of the list itself. However, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `results` to assign to `i`.

Given that the loop has just finished an iteration, it means that the current value of `i` was the last element of `results`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `results` must have had more than one element, and the loop would have processed all but the last element in the previous iterations.

Since the loop variable `i` is just taking the value of each element in `results`, we don't need to adjust `i` directly. Instead, we need to ensure that `results` still has elements left to process.

However, since the problem specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (which is just `i` in this case), and since `i` is not something we can meaningfully adjust to change the state of the loop's continuation, we consider the state of `results` as part of the context rather than something we can directly alter within the constraints given.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would reflect that `i` now holds the value of the next element in `results` if there are any left.

State: **`results` is a list of length `t` where `t` must be greater than 1, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`**. 

Note: This assumes that the previous iteration processed one element, so there must be at least one more element left for the loop to continue. If `t` was exactly 1 in the previous state, the loop would have ended, and this state would not apply. But based on the requirement to have the loop execute one more time, we assume `t` was greater than 1.
