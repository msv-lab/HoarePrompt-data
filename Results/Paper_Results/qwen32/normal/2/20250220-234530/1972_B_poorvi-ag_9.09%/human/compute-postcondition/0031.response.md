In the given task, the for loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. The loop variable `i` takes on the value of each element in the `results` list during each iteration.

To determine the state before the loop starts, we need to consider the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head only involves the variable `i` and the list `results`.

Since the loop iterates over the elements of `results`, the loop will execute if and only if `results` contains at least one element. The initial value of `i` is not explicitly set before the loop starts because `i` is assigned the value of each element in `results` during each iteration.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `results` has at least one element. The value of `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is automatically assigned by the loop.

State: **`results` is a list of length `t` where `t` must be greater than 0, and each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`**
