Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the string provided as input. If `n` is even, `results` is a list containing the string `'no'`. If `n` is odd, `results` is a list containing the string `'yes'` if `arr` has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, or `'no'` if `arr` has fewer or equal 'U' characters compared to 'D' characters.**
