To determine what will be printed when the `print(i)` statement is executed, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `results` is a list of length `t` where `t` must be greater than 1.
- Each element in the `results` list is either `'yes'` or `'no'`.

However, there is no mention of a variable `i` in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined in the provided initial state, it is impossible to determine its value based on the given information.

Given this lack of definition for `i`, we cannot provide a precise value for what will be printed. Therefore, the output will be described in terms of the undefined variable `i`.

Output: **i (where i is an undefined variable)**
