You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, for each test case n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: `results` is a list of length `t` where each element is either `'yes'` or `'no'`, determined by the rules specified in the loop.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: all elements of the `results` list have been printed, and `results` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it determines if the number of "U" characters is greater than the number of "D" characters only when `n` is odd. If so, it outputs "yes"; otherwise, it outputs "no".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all possible cases. Let's analyze the logic:

1. The program checks if the number of coins `n` is even. If it is, it concludes that Bob will win (`results.append('no')`). However, this is not necessarily true. The outcome depends on the distribution of "U" and "D" coins, not just the parity of `n`.

2. If `n` is odd, the program checks if the number of "U" coins is greater than the number of "D" coins. If so, it concludes that Alice will win (`results.append('yes')`). Otherwise, it concludes that Bob will win (`results.append('no')`). This logic is also flawed because the game involves strategic choices about which coin to flip, and the outcome is not solely determined by the initial counts of "U" and "D".

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

```
1
3
UUU
```

According to the program, since `n` is odd and the number of "U" coins is greater than the number of "D" coins, it would conclude that Alice wins (`'yes'`). However, let's see how the game actually plays out:

- Alice can choose any "U" coin. Suppose she chooses the first one. The configuration becomes `"DUU"`.
- Bob can then choose any "U" coin. Suppose he chooses the last one. The configuration becomes `"DD"`.
- Alice can choose the remaining "U" coin. The configuration becomes `"D"`.
- Bob cannot make a move because there are no "U" coins left, so Alice wins.

This shows that the program's logic is incorrect. The game's outcome is more complex and depends on the sequence of moves, not just the initial counts of "U" and "D" coins.

Thus, the program is incorrect for at least this case, and therefore the correctness is **False**.
