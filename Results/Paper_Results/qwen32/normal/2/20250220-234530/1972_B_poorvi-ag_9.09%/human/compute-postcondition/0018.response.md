Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, `results` is a list that now contains `'yes'` appended to its previous content, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

Explanation: The `results` list originally contained either `'no'` (if `n` was even) or `'yes'` or `'no'` (if `n` was odd, depending on the count of 'U' and 'D' in `arr`). After executing `results.append('yes')`, `'yes'` is added to the end of the `results` list. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `arr`, and the increment of `i` remain as per their initial conditions except for the modification to `results`.
