The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified, and the preconditions regarding `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D"; `results` is an empty list.**
