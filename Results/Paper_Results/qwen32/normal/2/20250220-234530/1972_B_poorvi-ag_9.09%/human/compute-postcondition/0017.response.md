The code appends the string `'no'` to the `results` list. Given the initial state, if `n` was even, `results` already contained `['no']`, and now it becomes `['no', 'no']`. If `n` was odd, `results` initially contained either `['yes']` or `['no']`, and after appending `'no'`, it becomes `['yes', 'no']` or `['no', 'no']` respectively.

The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, `results` is a list containing either `['no', 'no']` or `['yes', 'no']` depending on the initial value of `results`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
