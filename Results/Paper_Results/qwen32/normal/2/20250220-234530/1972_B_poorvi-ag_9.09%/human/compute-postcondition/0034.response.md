To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet. Here's the breakdown:

### Initial State:
- `results` is a list of length `t` where `t > 0`.
- Each element in the `results` list is either `'yes'` or `'no'`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state.
- Since `i` is not defined, it would result in a `NameError` if the code were to be executed without defining `i` beforehand.

Given the precondition, there is no information about the variable `i`. Therefore, the code as written will raise an error because `i` is not defined.

However, if we assume that `i` was intended to be used in some context (e.g., as an index or a counter), we cannot determine its value from the given information.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, the code will raise a `NameError`. But following the instructions to describe the output based on the given information:

Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined** (assuming the code is executed as is without defining `i`)
