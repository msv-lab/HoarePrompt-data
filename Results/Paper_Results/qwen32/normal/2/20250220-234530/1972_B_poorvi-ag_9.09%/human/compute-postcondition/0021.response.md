Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `n` is even, `results` is a list containing either `['no', 'no']` or `['yes', 'no']` depending on the initial value of `results`. If `n` is odd, `results` has `'yes'` appended to it if `arr` has more 'U' characters than 'D' characters, otherwise `'no'` is appended to it.**
