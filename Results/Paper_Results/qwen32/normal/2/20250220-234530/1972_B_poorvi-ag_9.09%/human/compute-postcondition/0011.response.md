The code appends the string `'no'` to the `results` list. No other variables are modified. Therefore, the `results` list, which was initially empty, now contains one element, `'no'`. All other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list containing ['no'], `arr` is the string provided as input, and `n` is odd. Additionally, the number of 'U's in `arr` is less than or equal to the number of 'D's in `arr`.**
