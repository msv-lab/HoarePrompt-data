The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This means that regardless of the initial contents of `results`, it will now include an additional `'no'` at the end.

Given the initial state, if `n` was even, `results` initially contained `['no']`. After appending `'no'`, `results` will be `['no', 'no']`.

If `n` was odd, `results` initially contained either `['yes']` or `['no']` depending on the count of 'U' and 'D' in `arr`. After appending `'no'`, `results` will be either `['yes', 'no']` or `['no', 'no']`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, but since the increment operation is not shown in the given code snippet, we will only reflect the changes to `results`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, `results` is a list containing `'no'` appended to its initial value, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
