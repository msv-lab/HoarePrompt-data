Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; `i` is 3; `x` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9; `res` is 'stair' if `y` is less than `z`, otherwise `res` is 'none'.**
