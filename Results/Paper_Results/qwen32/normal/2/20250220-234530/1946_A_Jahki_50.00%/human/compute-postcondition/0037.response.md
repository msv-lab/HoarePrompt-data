The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `num` is greater than 0
- `num2` is an input integer
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 0
- The loop iterates over `range(0, num)`

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken some value from 0 up to `num - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, provided it is still within the bounds of the range (0 to `num - 1`).

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
