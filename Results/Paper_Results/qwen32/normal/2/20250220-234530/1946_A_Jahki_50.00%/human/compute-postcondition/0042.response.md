The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `16668`. This value is explicitly provided in the code and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The initial state provides details about various variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `i`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `16668`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the number `16668`.

Output: **16668**
