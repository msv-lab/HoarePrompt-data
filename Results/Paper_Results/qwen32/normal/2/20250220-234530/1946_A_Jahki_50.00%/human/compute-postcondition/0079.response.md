The code snippet assigns the value of `num2` divided by 2 (integer division) to the variable `ma`. This means `ma` will hold the integer part of `num2 / 2`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `num`, `case`, `op`, and `i` remain unchanged. Only `ma` is introduced and assigned its new value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the `case` string, `b` is the sorted version of `a`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`**.
