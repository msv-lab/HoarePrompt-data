Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the fact that `i` is incremented by 1. However, the primary effect of the `break` statement is that the control flow exits the most internal loop or if statement.
