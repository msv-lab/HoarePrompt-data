Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 10000 and `num2` is even, `case` is an input string, `op` is 0, `b` is the sorted list of integers derived from `a`.**
