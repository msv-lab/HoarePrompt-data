The code snippet provided assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Since `b[ma]` was already incremented by 1 before this line, `new_median` will take on this incremented value.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `new_median` is now explicitly set to the value of `b[ma]` after its increment. All other variables retain their previously described states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the input string `case`, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 3, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 1, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` must be `b[ma] + 1` or greater, `new_median` is `b[ma]` after increment, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1**
