Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `num2` and the array elements `case`.

2. **Handling Large Inputs:**
   - There is a special condition `if num2 > 10000:` which is not part of the problem statement. This condition seems arbitrary and doesn't align with the problem requirements. Moreover, it breaks out of the loop after printing `1` and `16668`, which is incorrect behavior.

3. **Parsing and Sorting:**
   - The array elements are parsed into integers and stored in list `a`.
   - The array `a` is sorted and stored in list `b`.

4. **Finding the Median:**
   - The median index `ma` is calculated based on whether `num2` is even or odd.
   - The initial median `median` is set to the value at index `ma` in the sorted array `b`.

5. **Increasing the Median:**
   - A `while` loop is used to keep increasing the value at index `ma` until the new median exceeds the old median.
   - Inside the loop, the value at index `ma` is incremented by 1, the operation count `op` is incremented, and the array `b` is re-sorted to find the new median.
   - The loop continues until the new median is greater than the old median.

6. **Output:**
   - The number of operations `op` required to increase the median is printed for each test case.

### Issues Identified:
- **Arbitrary Condition:** The condition `if num2 > 10000:` is unnecessary and incorrectly breaks the loop, leading to incorrect results for arrays larger than 10000 elements.
- **Re-sorting Array:** Re-sorting the array `b` inside the loop is inefficient. Instead, we should use a more efficient approach to find the next median without sorting the entire array again.
- **Logic for Finding New Median:** The logic to find the new median after incrementing the value at index `ma` is flawed because it assumes that incrementing the value at `ma` will always result in the new median being at the same index, which is not necessarily true.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly the arbitrary condition and inefficient handling of the median calculation, the program is not correct according to the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
