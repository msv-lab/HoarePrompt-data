The given code snippet is:

```python
new_median = b[ma]
```

This line of code assigns the value of `b[ma]` to the variable `new_median`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the `case` string
- `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 3 and then re-sorted
- `num` is greater than 0
- `num2` is an input integer such that `ma` is a valid index in `b`
- `case` is an input string
- `op` is 3
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`
- `median` is `b[ma] + 1`
- `new_median` is `b[ma]`

After executing the code snippet, the only change is that `new_median` is explicitly set to `b[ma]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers derived from the digits in the `case` string, `b` is the sorted version of `a` with `b[ma]` incremented by 3 and then re-sorted, `num` is greater than 0, `num2` is an input integer such that `ma` is a valid index in `b`, `case` is an input string, `op` is 3, `i` is `i + 1`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`**
