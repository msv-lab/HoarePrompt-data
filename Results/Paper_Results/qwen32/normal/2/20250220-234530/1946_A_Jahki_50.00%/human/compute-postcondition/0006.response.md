The `print(1)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state provides details about several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `num2`, `case`, `op`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **1**
