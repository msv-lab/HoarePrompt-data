Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must have at least two elements, `t` is `[ai]` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is 0, `v` is even, `op` is 1, `ai` is `val` if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` is 0, `val` is the first element in the list `a`.**
