The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` (current value is 0), `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` (current value is 0).**
