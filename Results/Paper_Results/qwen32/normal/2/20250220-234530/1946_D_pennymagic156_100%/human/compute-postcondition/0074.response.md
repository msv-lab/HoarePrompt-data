The given code snippet modifies the variable `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between its current value and the `i`-th bit of `val`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` contains at least two elements.
- `ans` is -1.
- `i` is 1.
- `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`.
- `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.
- `op` is either 0 or the result of `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
- `ai` is `val`.
- If `op` is 0, then `t` is a list containing `ai`; otherwise, `t` remains an empty list.
- `val` is the second element of `a`.

The code snippet `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op` by XORing it with the `i`-th bit of `val`.

After executing the code, the new value of `op` will be `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least two elements, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is `val`, if `op` is 0, then `t` is a list containing `ai`; otherwise, `t` remains an empty list, `val` is the second element of `a`.**
