To determine the new state after executing the given code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the operation `op ^= val >> i & 1`.

Here's what happens:
- `val >> i & 1` extracts the `i`-th bit of `val`.
- `op ^= ...` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the extracted bit.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `op` is initially 0.
- `val` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it seems to be related to `x` since `u` is described as the `i`-th bit of `x`.
- `i` is 0.

Since `i` is 0, `val >> i & 1` effectively extracts the 0-th bit of `val`. Let's denote this extracted bit as `bit_val`.

The XOR operation `op ^= bit_val` means:
- If `bit_val` is 0, `op` remains 0.
- If `bit_val` is 1, `op` becomes 1.

Since `u` (which is the `i`-th bit of `x`) is not equal to 0 and `i` is 0, it implies that `bit_val` (the 0-th bit of `val`) is 1. Therefore, `op` will become 1.

Thus, the updated state is:
Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and `u` is not equal to 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` such that `v % 2` is equal to 0 and `v` is non-zero, `op` is 1, `cnt` is 0**.
