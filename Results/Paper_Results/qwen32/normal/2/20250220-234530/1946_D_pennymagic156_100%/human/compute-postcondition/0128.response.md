The given code snippet modifies the variable `ai` by performing an XOR operation between its current value and `val`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` contains at least two elements.
- `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`.
- `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.
- `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val` XORed with the original `op`.
- `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0.
- `val` is the second element in `a`.

The line `ai ^= val` changes the value of `ai` to the result of `ai XOR val`.

Since `ai` was initially 0 if `op` was 0, after the XOR operation, `ai` will be equal to `val` if `op` was 0.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0, `i` is 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is the `i`-th bit of `val` XORed with the original `op`, `ai` is `val` if `op` is 0, `val` is the second element in `a`.**
