### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

#### Key Points of the Problem:
1. We need to partition the array `a` into the maximum number of contiguous subarrays (`k`), such that:
   - The bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of these subarrays is less than or equal to `x`.
   - The subarrays must cover the entire array `a` without overlap.
   
2. If no such partition exists, we should return `-1`.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1`: Reads a line of integers from input and returns them as a list.
   - `func_2`: Reads a single integer from input.
   - `func_3`: Reads a line of integers from input and returns them as a map object.
   - `func_4`: Reads a line of input and removes leading/trailing whitespace.

2. **Main Function (`func_5`):**
   - Reads `n` and `x` using `func_3`.
   - Reads the array `a` using `func_1`.
   - Initializes `t` as an empty list and `ans` as `-1`.
   - Iterates over each bit position from 29 to 0 (since the maximum value of `a[i]` and `x` is less than \(2^{30}\)).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - Checks the `i`-th bit of `x` (`u`) and the total count of `i`-th bits set in `a` (`v`).
     - Depending on the values of `u` and `v`, it performs different operations:
       - If both `u` and `v` are 0, it continues to the next bit.
       - If `u` is 0 and `v` is odd, it returns `ans` immediately.
       - If `u` is 0 and `v` is even, it partitions `a` based on the `i`-th bit and updates `a` with the new partitions.
       - If `u` is 1 and `v` is odd, it continues to the next bit.
       - If `u` is 1 and `v` is even and non-zero, it counts the number of times the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits becomes 0 and updates `ans`.
       - If `u` is 1 and `v` is zero, it breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of `a`.

#### Verification Against Test Cases:
- The provided test cases seem to match the expected behavior of the code.
- The code handles various scenarios, including when `x` is 0, when the array cannot be partitioned, and when the array can be partitioned into multiple subarrays.

#### Conclusion:
The code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It iteratively checks each bit position and partitions the array accordingly, ensuring that the final result meets the conditions specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness: **True**
