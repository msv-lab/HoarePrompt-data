#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature. The function `func_1` reads input from standard input and returns a list of integers.
def func_1():

    #The program returns a list of integers that were read from the standard input and split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature, thus no specific precondition can be derived from it.
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer that is input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` prompts the user to input an integer and returns that integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_3`. This function is expected to read input from standard input and return a map object containing integers.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers that were obtained by splitting the input string and converting each split component into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature of `func_4`.
def func_4():

    #The program returns the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function implicitly uses values `n`, `x`, and `a` obtained from other functions. It processes the array `a` based on bitwise operations and returns either -1, a value stored in `ans`, or the maximum value between `ans` and the length of `a`.
