To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state:

- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. The specific values of `n` and `x` are not provided, but they do not affect the final return statement.
- `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0.
- `t` is an empty list and does not affect the final return statement.
- `ans` is the maximum number of times the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits became 0 across all bits.
- `i` is -1 and does not affect the final return statement.

The return statement is `return max(ans, len(a))`.

Given the information, the output state will be the maximum value between `ans` and the length of `a`.

Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of `a`.**
