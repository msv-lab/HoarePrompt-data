Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `i` iterates from 28 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, and `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. During the current iteration, `u` is not 0. If `v % 2` is not equal to 0, the loop continues with `i` decremented. If `v` is even and non-zero, `ans` is set to `cnt`, where `cnt` is the total number of times the total number of elements in `a` whose `i`-th bit is 1 is even across all bits. If `v` is 0, `ans` remains -1 and the loop breaks.**
