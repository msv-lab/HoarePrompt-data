The given code snippet appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Given that `t` was initially an empty list because `op` was 1, after appending `ai` to `t`, `t` will now contain one element, which is `ai`.

Here are the details of the output state:

- `n` and `x` are still the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` is still the value returned by `func_1()` and must have at least two elements.
- `t` is now a list containing `[ai]`.
- `ans` is still -1.
- `i` will still iterate from 29 down to 0.
- `u` is still the `i`-th bit of `x` and currently is 0.
- `v` is still the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and currently is even.
- `op` is still 1.
- `ai` is still `val`.
- `val` is still the first element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must have at least two elements, `t` is `[ai]`, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is 0, `v` is even, `op` is 1, `ai` is `val`, `val` is the first element in the list `a`.**
