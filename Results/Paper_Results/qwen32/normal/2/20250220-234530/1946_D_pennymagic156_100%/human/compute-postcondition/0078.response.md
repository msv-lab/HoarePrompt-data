Postcondition: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least two elements, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise `ai` remains unchanged, `val` is the second element of `a`, and `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0; otherwise, `t` remains an empty list.**
