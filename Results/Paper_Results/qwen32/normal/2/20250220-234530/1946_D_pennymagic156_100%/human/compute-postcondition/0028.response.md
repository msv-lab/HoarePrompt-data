The given code snippet modifies the variable `ai` using the XOR operation with `val`. Given the initial state, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, and `val` is the first element in the list `a`.

Since `op` is 0 initially (as per the description that `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0), `ai` starts at 0. After executing `ai ^= val`, `ai` will be equal to `val` because XORing 0 with any number results in that number.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must have at least two elements, `t` is a list containing `[val, val]` if `op` is 0, otherwise `t` remains an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and currently is 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and currently is even, `op` is 1 (since it was toggled from 0), `ai` is `val`, `val` is the first element in the list `a`.**
