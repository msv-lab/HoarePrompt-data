The code snippet `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between its current value and the value of `val`. 

Given the initial state, `ai` is 0 if `op` is 0, otherwise it remains unchanged. Since the code modifies `ai` regardless of its initial value, we need to reflect this change in the output state.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains at least two elements, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `val` is the third element of `a`, and `t` is a list containing `ai` if `op` is 0; otherwise, `t` remains an empty list.**

In natural language: The value of `ai` is now the result of `ai` XOR `val`. All other variables retain their previously described states.
