Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, and `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. During the current iteration, `u` is not 0, and `v` is even and non-zero, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for val in a:
    op ^= val >> i & 1
    if not op:
        cnt += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and has at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero. If `op` (the `i`-th bit of `x`) is 0, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and has at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero. If `op` (the `i`-th bit of `x`) is 0, then `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0. `val` is the next element in `a`, and `op` is updated to `op XOR (val >> i & 1)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is the value returned by `func_1()` and has at least one element, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` will iterate from 29 down to 0, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and is not 0, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a` and is even and non-zero. If `op` (the `i`-th bit of `x`) is 0, then `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0. `val` is the next element in `a`, `op` is updated to `op XOR (val >> i & 1)`. If `op` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1 again.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
