Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0. `t` is an empty list. `i` is 0. `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x` and `u` is not equal to 0. `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`. Additionally, `v % 2` is equal to 0, and `v` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `t`, `i`, `u`, `v` remain unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
