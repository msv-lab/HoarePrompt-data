The given code snippet initializes two variables `op` and `ai` to 0. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` contains elements from the original `a` where the cumulative XOR of the `i`-th bits results in 0, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 1, `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`, `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0. If `u` equals `v` equals 0, the state remains unchanged as described.**
