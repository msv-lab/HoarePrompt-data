### Explanation:
The loop continues to execute as long as `u` is non-zero. However, based on the provided output states after the first three iterations, we observe that `u` becomes 0 after each iteration. This means that the loop only runs for a maximum of 3 iterations before terminating. Since the list `b` does not change during these iterations and `u` is decremented to 0 after each iteration, the final state of the list remains the same as the initial state. The values of `c` and `d` do not affect the list `b` directly but influence the printed output, which is not part of the list state. Therefore, after all iterations, the list `b` retains its initial form.
