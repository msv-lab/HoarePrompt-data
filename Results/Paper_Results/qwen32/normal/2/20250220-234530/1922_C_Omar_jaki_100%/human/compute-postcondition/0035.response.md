To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **List `b`:** 
   - The list `b` is structured such that it contains repeated sums of a sequence of variables `v1, v2, ..., vk`. Specifically, the list contains pairs of values where:
     - The first value in each pair is a sum of the sequence up to a certain point.
     - The second value in each pair is twice the sum up to that point.
   - For example, if `v1=1` and `v2=2`, the list might look like `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 10, 8, 16, ...]`.

2. **Variable `u`:**
   - `u` is described as `u-2` and still greater than 0. This implies that `u` was initially at least 2, and after decrementing by 2, it remains positive. However, the exact value of `u` is not crucial for determining the output of the print statement.

3. **Variables `c` and `d`:**
   - `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`. The exact values of `c` and `d` are not specified, but they are indices used to access elements in the list `b`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

- **Index Calculation:**
  - `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` are used to access elements in the list `b`.
  - Since `b` contains pairs of values, `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` will always point to the first value in each pair.

- **Element Access:**
  - `b[(d - 1) * 2]` accesses the first value in the `d`-th pair.
  - `b[(c - 1) * 2]` accesses the first value in the `c`-th pair.

- **Subtraction:**
  - The print statement subtracts the first value in the `c`-th pair from the first value in the `d`-th pair.

### Conclusion:
Given the structure of the list `b`, the print statement calculates the difference between two sums in the sequence. Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical result. However, we can describe the output in terms of the indices `c` and `d`.

Output: **The difference between the sum at the d-th pair and the sum at the c-th pair in the list `b` (where `b[(d - 1) * 2]` is the sum at the d-th pair and `b[(c - 1) * 2]` is the sum at the c-th pair)**
