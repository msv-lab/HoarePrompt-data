Postcondition: **`a` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, `r1` is `2000000000.0`, `r2` is `2000000000.0`, `t` is `False`, `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`, `u` is `False`, and `c` and `d` are the return values of `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
