To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `a` is a list: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `r1` and `r2` are both `2000000000.0`
- `t` is `False`
- `b` is a list: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`
- `u` is `False`
- `c` and `d` are the return values of a function `r()`. We know that either `c < d` or `c >= d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
```

### Analysis:
The expression inside the `print` statement involves accessing elements from the list `b` using indices derived from `c` and `d`. Let's break down the expression:

1. **Indices Calculation:**
   - The index for `b[c * 2 - 1]` is `c * 2 - 1`.
   - The index for `b[d * 2 - 1]` is `d * 2 - 1`.

2. **List `b`:**
   - The list `b` is `[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`.

3. **Values of `c` and `d`:**
   - Since `c` and `d` are the return values of `r()`, their exact values are not provided. However, we know the relationship between them: either `c < d` or `c >= d`.

4. **Possible Indices:**
   - Given the list `b` has 8 elements, valid indices range from 0 to 7.
   - Therefore, `c` and `d` must be such that `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` fall within this range.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider two scenarios based on the relationship between `c` and `d`:

#### Scenario 1: `c < d`
- Suppose `c = 1` and `d = 2` (these are hypothetical values to illustrate the calculation).
  - Index for `b[c * 2 - 1]` is `1 * 2 - 1 = 1`.
  - Index for `b[d * 2 - 1]` is `2 * 2 - 1 = 3`.
  - Values at these indices in `b` are `b[1] = 0` and `b[3] = 1`.
  - The expression evaluates to `0 - 1 = -1`.

#### Scenario 2: `c >= d`
- Suppose `c = 2` and `d = 1` (these are hypothetical values to illustrate the calculation).
  - Index for `b[c * 2 - 1]` is `2 * 2 - 1 = 3`.
  - Index for `b[d * 2 - 1]` is `1 * 2 - 1 = 1`.
  - Values at these indices in `b` are `b[3] = 1` and `b[1] = 0`.
  - The expression evaluates to `1 - 0 = 1`.

### General Case:
Given the structure of the list `b` and the indices being calculated as `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1`, the difference `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` will always be either `1` or `-1` depending on whether `c < d` or `c >= d`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided initial state and the code snippet, the output of the `print` statement will be either `1` or `-1` depending on the relationship between `c` and `d`.

Output: **1 or -1 (depending on whether c < d or c >= d)**
