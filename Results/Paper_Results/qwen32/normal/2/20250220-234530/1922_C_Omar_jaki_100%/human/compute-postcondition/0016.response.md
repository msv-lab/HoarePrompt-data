To determine the final state of the loop after it has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop progresses and modifies the variable `b`. The loop iterates over the list `a` with a sliding window of four elements at a time, updating the list `b` based on the differences between these elements.

Here's the loop again for reference:
```python
for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    v = y - x
    b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
- **Initialization**: `b` starts as `[0, 0]`.
- **Loop Iteration**: For each iteration, the loop calculates `v = y - x` and updates `b` by appending two new values:
  - The first value is `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`.
  - The second value is `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`.

### Number of Iterations:
The loop runs `n - 2` times because it uses a sliding window of four elements (`w, x, y, z`) over a list of `n + 2` elements.

### Final State Calculation:
Let's denote the length of `a` as `n + 2`. The loop will run `n - 2` times, and each iteration appends two new elements to `b`. Therefore, after `n - 2` iterations, `b` will have `2 + 2*(n - 2) = 2n - 2` elements.

### Output State:
The final state of `b` will be a list with `2n - 2` elements, starting with `[0, 0]` and followed by pairs of calculated values based on the differences `v = y - x` and the conditions `v > x - w` and `v > z - y`.

### Final Output State:
Given the initial state and the nature of the loop, the final output state of `b` after all iterations can be described as follows:

Output State: **[0, 0, v1, v1, 2*v1, v1+v2, v1+v2, 2*v1+v2, ..., sum(v1, ..., vk), sum(v1, ..., vk), 2*sum(v1, ..., vk)]**

Where `v1, v2, ..., vk` are the differences `y - x` for each iteration of the loop.

However, since the exact values of `v1, v2, ..., vk` depend on the specific values in `a`, we can generalize the final form of `b` as having `2n - 2` elements starting with `[0, 0]` and following the pattern described above.

Thus, the final output state in the required format is:

Output State: **[0, 0, v1, v1, 2*v1, v1+v2, v1+v2, 2*v1+v2, ..., sum(v1, ..., vk), sum(v1, ..., vk), 2*sum(v1, ..., vk)]**
