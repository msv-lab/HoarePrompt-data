The value of `u` is decremented by 1. All other elements in the list remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **[0, 0, v1, v1, 2*v1, v1+v2, v1+v2, 2*v1+v2, ..., sum(v1, ..., vk), sum(v1, ..., vk), 2*sum(v1, ..., vk)], `u` is `u-1`**.

This means that the list retains its original values, and `u` is now one less than its initial value.
