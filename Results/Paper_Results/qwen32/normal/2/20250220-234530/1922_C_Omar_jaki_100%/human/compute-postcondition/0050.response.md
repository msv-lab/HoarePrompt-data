To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. These variables are derived from the list `a` using the `zip` function.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is `[-1000000000.0, r1, r2, 2000000000.0, r2 + v]`
- `v` is `y - x`
- `b` is `[-1000000000.0, r1, r2, 2000000000.0, r2 + v, r2 + v if v > x - w else r2 + 1, (r2 + v) + v if v > z - y else (r2 + v) + 1]`

In the previous iteration, the values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` were:
- `w` was `-1000000000.0`
- `x` was `r1`
- `y` was `r2`
- `z` was `2000000000.0`

For the next iteration, these values will shift as follows:
- `w` will take the value of `x` from the previous iteration, which is `r1`
- `x` will take the value of `y` from the previous iteration, which is `r2`
- `y` will take the value of `z` from the previous iteration, which is `2000000000.0`
- `z` will take the value of the next element in the list `a`, which is `r2 + v`

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `a` remains `[-1000000000.0, r1, r2, 2000000000.0, r2 + v]`
- `v` remains `y - x`
- `b` remains `[-1000000000.0, r1, r2, 2000000000.0, r2 + v, r2 + v if v > x - w else r2 + 1, (r2 + v) + v if v > z - y else (r2 + v) + 1]`
- `w` is now `r1`
- `x` is now `r2`
- `y` is now `2000000000.0`
- `z` is now `r2 + v`

State: **`a` is `[-1000000000.0, r1, r2, 2000000000.0, r2 + v]`; `v` is `y - x`; `b` is `[-1000000000.0, r1, r2, 2000000000.0, r2 + v, r2 + v if v > x - w else r2 + 1, (r2 + v) + v if v > z - y else (r2 + v) + 1]`; `w` is `r1`; `x` is `r2`; `y` is `2000000000.0`; `z` is `r2 + v`**
