You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

from math import log

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    res = func_1()
    print(res)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'
    return s[:k] * n
    #The program returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of `s` repeated `n` times. Given `s` is `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`, the output will be the first `k` letters of the alphabet repeated `n` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input, and returns a string consisting of the first `k` letters of the alphabet repeated `n` times.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to generate a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in `s`. The generated string should be of minimal length.

### Given Program Analysis:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. Here's why:

1. **String Construction**:
   - The function `func_1()` constructs the string `s` by taking the first `k` letters of the alphabet and repeating this sequence `n` times.
   - For example, if `n=2` and `k=3`, the string `s` would be `"abcabc"`.
   
2. **Subsequence Requirement**:
   - The requirement is that every possible string of length `n` using the first `k` letters must appear as a subsequence in `s`.
   - For `n=2` and `k=3`, the possible strings of length 2 are: `"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ac"`, `"ba"`, `"bb"`, `"bc"`, `"ca"`, `"cb"`, `"cc"`.
   - The string `"abcabc"` does not contain all these subsequences. For instance, `"aa"`, `"bb"`, and `"cc"` are missing.

3. **Minimal Length**:
   - Even if the string contained all subsequences, the constructed string would not necessarily be of minimal length.
   - For example, for `n=2` and `k=2`, the string `"baab"` is of minimal length and contains all subsequences `"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ba"`, `"bb"`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not generate a string that meets the criteria of containing all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters of the alphabet. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters are present in the generated string `s`. Additionally, it does not guarantee that the string is of minimal length.
Correctness: **False**
