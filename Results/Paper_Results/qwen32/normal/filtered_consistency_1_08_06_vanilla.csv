This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * ""? a b c d"" 

After that, you receive:

  * ""<"" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ""="" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "">"" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * ""! i j"" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query ""? 1 1 2 3"", the jury return ""="" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query ""? 1 2 0 3"", the jury return "">"" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any

alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number

move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

example ""(()(("".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example ""(()(()))"".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses ""("" minus the number of closing parentheses "")"". For example, the
balance of the sequence ""(()(("" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
""()(()())"". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters ""(""
and "")"". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq

alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.
