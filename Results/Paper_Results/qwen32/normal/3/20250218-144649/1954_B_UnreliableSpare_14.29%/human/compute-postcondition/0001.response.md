The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and assigns this list to the variable `arr`. The value of `n` is already determined from a previous input and is not changed by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input.**
