Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed analysis of why:

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic for Checking if the Array is Beautiful**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that an array is beautiful if all elements are the same. However, the problem defines an array as beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`. This means the array can have alternating patterns but still be beautiful if the operation can reduce it to a single value.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Removals**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove by counting the longest contiguous segment of identical elements and assuming that removing elements outside this segment will make the array not beautiful. However, this does not account for the possibility of making the array not beautiful by removing elements in a way that disrupts the ability to reduce the array to a single value through the allowed operation.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the array can be made not beautiful by removing a smaller number of elements than the length of the longest contiguous segment. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program incorrectly outputs `3` when the correct answer is `3` (but the logic should be more robust to handle variations).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, one should:
- Traverse the array to identify segments where the array can be transformed into a single value using the allowed operation.
- Determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to disrupt this transformation.
- Handle special cases where the array is already not beautiful or where removing a specific set of elements can make it not beautiful.

### Example Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_removals_to_not_beautiful(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 1:
        return -1
    
    # Find the longest contiguous segment of identical elements
    max_len = 1
    current_len = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            current_len += 1
        else:
            max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
            current_len = 1
    max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
    
    if max_len == n:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the minimum removals needed
    min_removals = n - max_len
    
    # Check for other possible ways to make it not beautiful
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if arr[i - 1] == arr[i + 1] and arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            min_removals = min(min_removals, 1)
    
    return min_removals

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min_removals_to_not_beautiful(arr))
```

This corrected version considers the longest contiguous segment of identical elements and checks if removing a single element can make the array not beautiful, which is a more comprehensive approach to solving the problem.
