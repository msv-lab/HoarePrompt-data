### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Checking if All Elements are the Same**:
   - The program initializes a flag `flag` to `True` and iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same. If it finds any two consecutive elements that are different, it sets the flag to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Finding Minimum Sequence Length**:
   - If the flag remains `True` after the loop, it means all elements are the same, and the program outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and iterates through the array to find the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements that are not equal to the first element `val`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the flag is `True`, it prints `-1` because the array is already beautiful and removing any element will not make it less beautiful.
   - If the flag is `False`, it prints the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements that are not equal to the first element.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **All Elements the Same**:
  - The program correctly identifies if all elements are the same and outputs `-1` in such cases. This matches the problem's requirement.

- **Finding Minimum Sequence Length**:
  - The logic for finding the minimum sequence length of elements not equal to the first element is flawed. The program only considers sequences starting from the beginning of the array. It does not correctly handle cases where the sequence of elements not equal to the first element is in the middle or at the end of the array.
  - For example, in the test case `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`, the program will output `3` because it will find the sequence `3 3 3` at the beginning. However, the correct answer should be `1` because removing the `5` makes the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove in some cases, specifically when the sequence of elements not equal to the first element is not at the beginning of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
