Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Check if all elements are the same**: The program correctly identifies if all elements in the array are the same and outputs `-1` if they are. This part is correct.

2. **Finding the minimum number of elements to remove**: The program attempts to find the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements that are not equal to the first element. However, this approach is flawed. The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful, which means we need to break the pattern that allows the array to be transformed into a uniform array using the given operation.

   - The program does not consider the entire structure of the array and how the operation can be applied to multiple segments of the array.
   - The program does not account for the possibility of removing elements from different parts of the array to break the beautiful property.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the solution is simply the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive elements that are not equal to the first element.

For example, in the test case `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`, the program would incorrectly output `3` because it finds the sequence `5` of length `1` which is not equal to the first element `3`. However, the correct answer is `3` because we can remove the first three `3`s to break the beautiful property.

A correct approach would involve analyzing the array to find segments where the operation can be applied and determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to disrupt these segments.

Correctness: **False**
