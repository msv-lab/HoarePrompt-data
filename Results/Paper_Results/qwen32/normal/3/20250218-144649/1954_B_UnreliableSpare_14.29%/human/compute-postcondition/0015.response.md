Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `i` is 3. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `flag` or any other variables.**
