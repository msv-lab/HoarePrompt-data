The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` compares the current value of `ans` with `cnt` and assigns the smaller value back to `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt` is `0`. Since `0` is smaller than `Decimal('Infinity')`, `ans` will be updated to `0`.

Output State: **`flag` is True, `ans` is `0`, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is `0`, `i` is `0`, `n` is greater than `0`, and `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`**.
