Output State: **`flag` is True, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 2 if `arr[0]` equals `val` and `arr[1]` equals `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `ans` is `min(ans, cnt)`**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged.
