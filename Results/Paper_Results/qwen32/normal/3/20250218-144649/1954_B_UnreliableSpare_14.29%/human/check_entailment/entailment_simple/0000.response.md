Reasoning: 
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first checking if the entire array is composed of the same element, in which case it outputs `-1` because such an array cannot stop being beautiful by removing any elements. 

If the array is not composed of the same element, the program then looks for the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of the array. This is done by iterating through the array and counting the length of sequences that match the first element and updating the minimum length of such sequences when a different element is encountered.

However, this approach is flawed. The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove such that the remaining array cannot be transformed into an array of identical elements using the given operation. The program only considers sequences of elements equal to the first element and does not account for other sequences within the array that might need to be removed.

For example, in the test case:
```
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The program will output `3`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `3`, but the logic used in the program does not correctly identify this because it only considers sequences of `3`s starting from the beginning of the array and does not consider the sequence of `3`s after the `5`.

A correct approach would involve more sophisticated logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove, potentially by using dynamic programming or a different strategy to evaluate all possible sequences and their removal impacts.

Correctness: **False**
