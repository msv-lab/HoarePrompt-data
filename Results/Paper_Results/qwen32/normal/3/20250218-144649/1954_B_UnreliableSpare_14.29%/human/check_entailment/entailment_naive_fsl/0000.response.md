Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Here is a detailed analysis of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removal**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements (`cnt`) and then prints this value as the answer, which is incorrect. The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition, not the length of the longest sequence of identical elements.
   - For example, consider the input array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The longest sequence of identical elements is `3` with a count of `5`. However, to make the array stop being beautiful, we need to remove `3` elements (the three `5`'s or any three `3`'s that are not part of a sequence that can be reduced to a single element).

2. **Handling of Single Element Arrays**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by printing `-1`. However, the logic is not robust for other cases.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the array can be broken into multiple segments that can be reduced independently. For instance, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program incorrectly outputs `1` when the correct answer is `1` (removing any `2`), but the logic is flawed for more complex cases.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program outputs `1`, but the correct output should be `1`. However, this is not a strong counterexample to show the incorrectness. A stronger counterexample would be:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The program outputs `3`, but the correct output should be `3` (removing the three `3`'s surrounding the `5`).

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one needs to identify the segments of the array that can be reduced to a single element and calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition. This involves dynamic programming or a more sophisticated approach to track and merge segments.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not handle the problem description correctly for all cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
