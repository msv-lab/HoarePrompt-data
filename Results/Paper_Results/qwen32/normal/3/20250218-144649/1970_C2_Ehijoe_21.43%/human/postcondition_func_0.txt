The function `func_1` calculates distances from a starting node in a graph represented by a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors. It avoids revisiting the parent node and returns a list of distances. If the starting node has only one neighbor which is the parent, it returns `[0]`. Otherwise, it returns a list of incremented distances from recursive calls to its neighbors, excluding the parent.
