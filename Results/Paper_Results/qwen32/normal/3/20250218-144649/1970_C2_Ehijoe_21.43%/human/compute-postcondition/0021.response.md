Postcondition: **`nodes` is a defaultdict with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is the first integer from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2. If the length of the value for some key (`key`) in `nodes` is 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing that `key`. Otherwise, `leaves` is an empty deque.**
