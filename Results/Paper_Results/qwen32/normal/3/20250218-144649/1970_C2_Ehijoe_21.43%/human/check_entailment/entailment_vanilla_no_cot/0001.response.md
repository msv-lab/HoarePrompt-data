Let's break down the code and verify its correctness step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - We have a tree with `n` nodes.
    - The game consists of `t=1` round.
    - The game starts with a stone on a specific node.
    - Players alternate turns moving the stone to an adjacent inactive node.
    - The player who cannot make a move loses.
    - We need to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight**:
    - The game can be analyzed based on the distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes.
    - If there exists at least one path from the starting node to a leaf with an odd number of edges, Ron wins because he can force Hermione into a position where she has no move left.
    - If all paths from the starting node to leaves have even numbers of edges, Hermione wins because Ron will eventually be forced into a position where he has no move left.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
    - **func_1**: This recursive function calculates the distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes in the tree. It returns a list of these distances.
        - If the current node is a leaf (i.e., it has only one neighbor which is the parent), it returns `[0]`.
        - Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances for all its children and adds `1` to each distance to account for the edge to the child.
    - **func_2**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and uses `func_1` to determine the distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes.
        - It checks if there is any odd distance in the list of distances.
        - If there is an odd distance, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

4. **Verification**:
    - The code correctly constructs the tree using adjacency lists.
    - It correctly identifies all leaf nodes.
    - The recursive function `func_1` correctly calculates the distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes.
    - The logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the distances is correct.

5. **Example Verification**:
    - For the given example, the tree is:
        ```
        1 -- 2
        |
        3 -- 4
        |
        5
        ```
    - Starting at node `1`, the distances to the leaves are `[1, 2, 2]` (to nodes `2`, `4`, `5` respectively).
    - Since there is an odd distance (`1`), Ron wins, which matches the expected output.

**Conclusion**:
The code is correct and implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
