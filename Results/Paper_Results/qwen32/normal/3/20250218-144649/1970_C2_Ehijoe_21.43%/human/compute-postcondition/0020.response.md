The code appends the `key` to the `leaves` deque. The other variables remain unchanged except for `leaves` which now contains the `key`.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict with at least one key-value pair where the length of the value for some key (referred to as `key`) is 1, `start` is an integer representing the starting node such that 1 <= start <= n, `n` is the first integer from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n-2, `leaves` is a deque containing the `key`.**
