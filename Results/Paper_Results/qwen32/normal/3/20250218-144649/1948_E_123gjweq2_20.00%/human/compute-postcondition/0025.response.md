Functionality: **The function `make_array` modifies the array `arr` by filling a segment from index `left` to `right` with a specific sequence of numbers. The first half of this segment is filled with increasing numbers starting from `left + 1`, and the second half is filled with decreasing numbers starting from `right + 1`. Simultaneously, it updates another array `cliquess` to set all values in the same segment to the given `clique` number.**
