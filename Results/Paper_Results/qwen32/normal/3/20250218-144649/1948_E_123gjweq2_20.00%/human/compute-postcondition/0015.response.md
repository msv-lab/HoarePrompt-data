The code snippet assigns values to elements in the `arr` array starting from the index `left + mid` to `left + right`. Specifically, it sets `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right` is at least `left + 2`.
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.
- `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + right` will be updated to `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right` is at least `left + 2`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`.**
