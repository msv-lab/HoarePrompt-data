You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess`. This is not a good practice and can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in multiple test cases. The variables should be passed as parameters or returned from functions.

2. **Logic in `make_array`**: The logic inside `make_array` does not correctly assign values to `arr` and `cliquess` to ensure that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied for all pairs within the same clique. The current implementation just assigns values in a way that does not guarantee the required condition.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n` is small or `k` is large, the program should ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The current implementation does not guarantee this.

4. **Output Format**: The program should print the output for each test case as specified in the problem description. The current implementation does not handle multiple test cases correctly.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Let's consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`. The program might output something like:
```
1 2 3 4 5
1
1 1 1 1 1
```
However, with `k = 4`, it is possible to have fewer cliques. A correct output could be:
```
1 3 5 2 4
2
1 1 1 2 2
```
Here, vertices 1, 3, and 5 form one clique, and vertices 2 and 4 form another clique, satisfying the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 4 \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the required logic and does not handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
