Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from solving the problem correctly:

1. **Variable Scope**: The variables `arr` and `cliquess` are defined within the `func_1` function but are used in the `make_array` function. This will result in a `NameError` because `make_array` does not have access to these variables.

2. **Logic for Assigning Values and Cliques**: The logic for assigning values to the vertices and determining the cliques is incorrect. The program does not ensure that the edges are added according to the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

3. **Output Format**: The program does not correctly format the output as required. It should print the values assigned to the vertices, the number of cliques, and the partition of the graph into cliques.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def solve(n, k):
    # Assign values to vertices
    arr = list(range(1, n + 1))
    cliques = []
    clique = 1
    
    # Create cliques based on the condition
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if abs(i - j) + abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= k:
                continue
            else:
                # If the condition fails, start a new clique
                clique += 1
                break
        else:
            # If the loop completes without breaking, continue with the same clique
            continue
        # Assign the new clique number to the remaining vertices
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if abs(i - j) + abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= k:
                cliques.append(clique)
            else:
                break
    
    # Assign the last clique number to any remaining vertices
    for i in range(len(cliques), n):
        cliques.append(clique)
    
    # Output the results
    print(*arr)
    print(clique)
    print(*cliques)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        k = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        solve(n, k)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version of the program assigns values to the vertices and determines the cliques based on the given condition. It also ensures that the output is formatted correctly. However, the logic for determining the minimum number of cliques might still need refinement to ensure optimality.
