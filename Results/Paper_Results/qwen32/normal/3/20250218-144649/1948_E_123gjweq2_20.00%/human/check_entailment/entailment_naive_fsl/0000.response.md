Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess`. This is not a good practice and can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in multiple test cases. The variables should be passed as parameters or returned from functions.

2. **Logic in `make_array`**: The logic inside `make_array` does not correctly assign values to `arr` and `cliquess` to ensure that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied for all pairs within the same clique. The current implementation just assigns values in a way that does not guarantee the required condition.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n` is small or `k` is large, the program should ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The current implementation does not guarantee this.

4. **Output Format**: The program should print the output for each test case as specified in the problem description. The current implementation does not handle multiple test cases correctly.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Let's consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`. The program might output something like:
```
1 2 3 4 5
1
1 1 1 1 1
```
However, with `k = 4`, it is possible to have fewer cliques. A correct output could be:
```
1 3 5 2 4
2
1 1 1 2 2
```
Here, vertices 1, 3, and 5 form one clique, and vertices 2 and 4 form another clique, satisfying the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 4 \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the required logic and does not handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
