To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the effect of the loop on the array `arr` and the list `cliquess`.

The loop runs for `mid` iterations, where `mid` is defined as `(right - left) // 2`. During each iteration `i` (ranging from 0 to `mid - 1`), the following operations are performed:
- `arr[left + i]` is set to `small_element + i`, which is `left + 1 + i`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`.

Given that the loop runs for `mid` iterations, after all iterations, the values from `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` will be filled with values starting from `left + 1` up to `left + mid`. Similarly, the values from `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` will be set to `clique`.

### Output State:
- `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
- `clique` remains unchanged.
- `small_element` remains unchanged.
- `big_element` remains unchanged.
- `mid` remains unchanged.
- `not_mid` remains unchanged.
- `arr[left + i]` will be `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from 0 to `mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` will be `clique` for each `i` from 0 to `mid - 1`.

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop finishes executing, the elements in the array `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` will be filled with consecutive integers starting from `left + 1` up to `left + mid`. Additionally, the elements in the list `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` will all be set to the value of `clique`. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n and right is at least left + 2, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is left + 1, `big_element` is right + 1, `mid` is (right - left) // 2, `not_mid` is right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2, `arr[left + i]` is left + 1 + i for each i from 0 to mid - 1, `cliquess[left + i]` is clique for each i from 0 to mid - 1.**
