The given code snippet modifies the value of `arr[left + mid + i]`. Before this line, `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`. The line provided reassigns `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`, which means the value does not change.

Given that `i` is being incremented in the initial state, let's assume `i` was some value `j` before the statement, and after the statement, `i` becomes `j + 1`. The value at `arr[left + mid + j]` remains `big_element - j`.

The other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, and the other elements of `arr` and `cliquess`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right` is at least `left + 2`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
