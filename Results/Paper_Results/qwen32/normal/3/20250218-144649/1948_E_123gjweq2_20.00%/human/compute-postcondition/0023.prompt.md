Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n and right is at least left + 2, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is left + 1, `big_element` is right + 1, `mid` is (right - left) // 2, `not_mid` is right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2, `arr[left + i]` is left + 1 + i for each i from 0 to mid - 1, `cliquess[left + i]` is clique for each i from 0 to mid - 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(not_mid):
    arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
    cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right` is at least `left + 2`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right` is at least `left + 2`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right` is at least `left + 2`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `left + 1 + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for each `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`; `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
