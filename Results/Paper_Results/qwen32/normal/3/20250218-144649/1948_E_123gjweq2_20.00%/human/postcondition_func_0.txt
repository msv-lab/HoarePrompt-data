The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 40 inclusive, and `k` is between 1 and 2n inclusive. It calculates the ceiling of `n` divided by `k` and creates two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, each of length `n`. These lists are filled with consecutive integers starting from 1 up to the calculated ceiling, with each segment of `k` elements containing the same integer. The function prints the elements of `arr`, the calculated ceiling value, and then the elements of `cliquess`.
