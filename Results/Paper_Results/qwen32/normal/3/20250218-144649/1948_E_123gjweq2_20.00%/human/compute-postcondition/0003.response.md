The code snippet calculates the value of `not_mid` based on the existing variables. Given the initial state, `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - mid`.

Since `mid` is defined as `(right - left) // 2`, we can substitute this into the equation for `not_mid`:

`not_mid = right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`

Therefore, the value of `not_mid` is determined by the above expression.

The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.**
