Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `mex` has `minn` appended to it, `minn` is `minn + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `minn` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
