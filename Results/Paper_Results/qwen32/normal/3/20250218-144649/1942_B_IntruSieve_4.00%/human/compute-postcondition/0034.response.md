Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `mex` contains an additional element equal to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, and `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)` if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than the original `maxx`.**
