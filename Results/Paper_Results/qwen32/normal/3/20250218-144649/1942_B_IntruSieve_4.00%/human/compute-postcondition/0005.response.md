To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(n):
```

This means the loop will iterate over the range from 0 to `n-1`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is such that the loop can execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute because the range will be empty.
2. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be automatically initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. We don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts as it is controlled by the loop itself.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `mex` is an empty list
- `minn` is 0
- `maxx` is 0

The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n`. It must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mex` is an empty list, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is 0**
