The value of `minn` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mex` is [0], `minn` is 1, `maxx` is 0, and `arr[i]` is greater than 0.
