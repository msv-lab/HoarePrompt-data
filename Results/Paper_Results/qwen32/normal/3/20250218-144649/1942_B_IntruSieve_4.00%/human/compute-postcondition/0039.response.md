The only object in the loop head is the variable `itm`, which iterates over the elements of the list `mex`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `itm` and how it relates to the list `mex`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `itm` has taken on the value of the current element in `mex`. For the loop to execute one more time, `itm` must be updated to the next element in the list `mex`. The values of `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue executing, as they are not part of the loop head.

Given that `mex` is a list of `n` integers and `n` must be at least 1, we can infer that there are more elements in `mex` for the loop to iterate over, provided `itm` has not yet reached the last element.

State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be at least 1, `minn` is an integer, and `maxx` is an integer representing the maximum value in `mex`. `itm` is the next element in `mex`**.

Since we don't have the specific value of `itm` from the previous iteration, we can only say that `itm` will be the next element in the list `mex` for the next iteration. If we assume that `itm` was the `k`-th element in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `itm` will be the `(k+1)`-th element.

For the sake of a concrete example, if `itm` was the first element in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `itm` will be the second element.

State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be at least 1, `minn` is an integer, and `maxx` is an integer representing the maximum value in `mex`. `itm` is the next element in `mex`**.

If we need to be more specific and assume `itm` was the first element, then:

State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be at least 1, `minn` is an integer, and `maxx` is an integer representing the maximum value in `mex`. `itm` is the second element in `mex`**.

However, without knowing the exact position of `itm` in the list from the previous iteration, the most accurate state to represent is:

State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be at least 1, `minn` is an integer, and `maxx` is an integer representing the maximum value in `mex`. `itm` is the next element in `mex`**.
