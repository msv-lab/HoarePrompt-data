The code snippet provided assigns the value `0` to the variable `maxx`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `mex`, `minn`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0; `maxx` is 0.**
