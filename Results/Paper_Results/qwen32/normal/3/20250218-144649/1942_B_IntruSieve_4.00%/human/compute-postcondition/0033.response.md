The code snippet assigns the value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the variable `maxx`. This means that `maxx` now holds the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of the list `arr` and the variable `minn`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `mex` contains an additional element equal to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`

After executing the code, the value of `maxx` is updated as described. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `mex` contains an additional element equal to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, `maxx` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`**.
