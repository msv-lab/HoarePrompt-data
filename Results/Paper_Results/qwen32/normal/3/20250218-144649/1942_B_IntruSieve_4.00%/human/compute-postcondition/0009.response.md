Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mex` is [0], `minn` is equal to `maxx`, and both `minn` and `maxx` are 1, and `arr[i]` is greater than 0.**
