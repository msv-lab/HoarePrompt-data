The given code snippet appends the value of `minn` to the list `mex`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state but are not affected by the code snippet provided. The only change is that `mex` now includes the value of `minn` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `mex` has `minn` appended to it.**
