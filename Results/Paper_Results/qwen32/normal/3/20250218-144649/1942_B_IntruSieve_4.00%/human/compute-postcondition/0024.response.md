The code assigns the value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `maxx`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `i`, and `mex` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, `mex` has a new element which is `abs(arr[i] - minn)` appended to it, `maxx` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.**
