Given the initial state, we have:
- `mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` is at least 1.
- `minn` is an integer (though its value is not explicitly given in the initial state, it's mentioned for completeness).
- `maxx` is an integer representing the maximum value in `mex`.
- `itm` is the next element in `mex`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(itm, end=' ')
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to identify the value of `itm`. According to the precondition, `itm` is described as "the next element in `mex`". However, without knowing the specific values in the `mex` list, we can only say that `itm` is the first element of the list `mex` since no specific position for `itm` is given other than it being "the next element".

Therefore, `itm` is `mex[0]`.

Output: **mex[0] (where mex[0] is the first element of the list `mex`)**
