t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, c) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. Each tuple represents a test case with a being the number of introverts, b being the number of extroverts, and c being the number of universals.
