Postcondition: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. Otherwise, `k` is set to `a + (b + c) // 3`.**
