The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state includes the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t`, which represent the number of introverts, extroverts, universals, and the number of test cases respectively. Since the input operation does not affect these variables, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c, where 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals respectively. There are t test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer.**
