The code snippet provided updates the value of `max_diff` to the value of `diff`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `max_diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `index` is 3 if `diff` is greater than the previous `max_diff`, otherwise `index` remains None, `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`**.
