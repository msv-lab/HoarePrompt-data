Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]` and `index` is set to 2. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf and `index` remains None. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.**
