Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F` are unchanged, `max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`, `index` is None, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `next_max_diff` is updated to be equal to `diff`, which is `A[1] - A[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
