You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It processes a number of test cases, which is determined by the value returned from `func_3()`. For each test case, it executes `func_6()`. The final state of the program after it concludes is that all test cases have been processed by executing `func_6()` the corresponding number of times.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`, `m`, and `k`: the number of prepared problems, models, and functions.
     - `A`: the list of complexities of the prepared problems.
     - `D`: the list of complexities of the models.
     - `F`: the list of complexities of the functions.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the minimum possible imbalance after optionally adding one new problem with complexity `d_i + f_j` to the list `A`.

3. **Imbalance Calculation**:
   - The imbalance is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list of problem complexities.
   - The goal is to minimize this imbalance by strategically choosing `d_i` and `f_j` to insert a new problem if necessary.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_2()` reads a line from standard input.
   - `func_3()` reads an integer.
   - `func_4()` reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list of integers.
   - `func_5()` reads a line of text.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - `func_6()` reads the input for a single test case.
   - It calculates the current maximum and next maximum differences between consecutive elements in `A`.
   - It then iterates over each function complexity `f` in `F` and tries to find the optimal model complexity `d` in `D` to minimize the imbalance.
   - The binary search (`bisect_right`, `bisect_left`) is used to find the appropriate position in `D` for the new problem complexity `d + f`.
   - The program calculates the potential new imbalance and updates the answer if it is smaller than the current best.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum imbalance for each test case.

### Issues in the Code:
- **Function 1 and Function 2**:
  - `func_1` and `wrapper` are defined but never used. They seem to be intended for memoization but are not correctly implemented or integrated into the program.
  - The `d` dictionary in `wrapper` is local to `func_1` and will not work as intended because `d` is not defined in `wrapper`.

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The core algorithm for finding the optimal new problem complexity and minimizing the imbalance seems correct.
  - The use of binary search to find the optimal position in `D` is appropriate and efficient.

### Conclusion:
While the algorithmic approach seems correct, the presence of unused and improperly defined functions (`func_1` and `wrapper`) suggests that the code might not be fully functional or optimized. However, based on the provided example inputs and outputs, the core logic appears to produce the correct results.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True** (assuming the unused functions do not interfere with the core logic and that the core logic is correct based on the example provided)

However, it is recommended to remove or properly implement the unused functions for a cleaner and more reliable solution.
