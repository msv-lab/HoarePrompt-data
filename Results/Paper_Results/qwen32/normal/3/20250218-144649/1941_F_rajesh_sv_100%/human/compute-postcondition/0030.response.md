Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `max_diff` is -inf, `index` is None. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.**
