The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The value of `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are -inf, `A`, `D`, `F` are lists or variables as initially defined. If `diff` (which is `A[2] - A[1]`) is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, and `index` is set to 2. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` remains None, and `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`; otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains -inf.**
