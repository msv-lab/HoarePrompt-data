The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `testcases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `testcases`. If `testcases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` must be greater than or equal to 2. Since `_` is a throwaway variable (not used in the loop body), it does not need to be adjusted. For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must be decremented by 1, making it at least 1.

State: **`testcases` is the return value of `func_3()` and must be equal to 1**
