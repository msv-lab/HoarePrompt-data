Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described.

1. **Function `func_1` and `wrapper` are not used**: The functions `func_1` and `wrapper` are defined but never used in the program. They seem to be intended for memoization, but they are not integrated into the logic of the program.

2. **Binary Search Logic in `func_6` is incorrect**: The binary search logic in `func_6` is flawed. Specifically, the logic for adjusting the `l` and `h` pointers in the binary search loop is incorrect. The condition `if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` does not correctly determine the optimal position to insert the new problem complexity. This can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if the new problem complexity is intended to minimize the imbalance, the current logic might not correctly identify the optimal insertion point. The program should consider cases where the new problem complexity could be inserted at the beginning, end, or between existing problems.

4. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `max_diff`, but this might not be the correct initial value in all cases. The program should consider the possibility that adding a new problem could result in an imbalance smaller than `max_diff`.

5. **Output Handling**: The program prints the result for each test case directly within the loop, which is correct, but the logic leading to this output might be flawed due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
