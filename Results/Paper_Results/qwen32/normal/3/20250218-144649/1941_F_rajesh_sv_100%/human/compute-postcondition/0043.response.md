Postcondition: **`n` is the length of list `A`, `m` and `k` remain unchanged, `A` and `D` remain unchanged, `F` is a list that must have at least one element, `max_diff` holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` holds the index of the element in `A` where `max_diff` occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, and `right` is `A[index]`; `ans` is equal to `max_diff`; `l` is the position in the sorted list `D` where `left - f` would be inserted to keep `D` sorted; `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` and `l < h`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; and `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`**
