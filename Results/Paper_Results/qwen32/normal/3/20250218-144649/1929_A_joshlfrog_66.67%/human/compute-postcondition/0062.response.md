The code snippet `x = nums[i]` directly assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `x`. Given that `i` is 4, `x` will now hold the value of `nums[4]`. The values of `t`, `l`, `e`, `y`, and the other elements in `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces, `e` is `e + 1`, `x` is `nums[4]`, `y` is either the original value of `y` or `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than the original value of `y`, `i` is 4**.
