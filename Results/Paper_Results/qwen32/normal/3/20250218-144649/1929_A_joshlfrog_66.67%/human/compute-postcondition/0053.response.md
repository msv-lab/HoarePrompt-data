The value of `y` is explicitly set to 100000000. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is a new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces; `x` is 0; `y` is 100000000; `e` is `e + 1`.**
