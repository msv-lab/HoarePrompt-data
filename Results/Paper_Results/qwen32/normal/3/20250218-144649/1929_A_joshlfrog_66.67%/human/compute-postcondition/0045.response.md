The value of `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. The values of `t`, `l`, `nums`, `i`, `x`, and `e` remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than `i + 1`; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces; `i` is `i + 1`. If `nums[i] > x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. `e` is `e + 1`; `y` is `nums[i]`.**
