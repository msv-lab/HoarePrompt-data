The code snippet takes an input string, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `nums`. The variables `t` and `l` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces.**
