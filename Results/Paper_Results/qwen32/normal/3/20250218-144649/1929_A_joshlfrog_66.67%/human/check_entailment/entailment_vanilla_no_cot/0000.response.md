Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order, as this will maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

The current implementation only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which does not account for the sum of all consecutive differences. Here's the corrected approach:

1. Sort the array in ascending or descending order.
2. Calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        nums.sort()  # or nums.sort(reverse=True)
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, l):
            beauty += nums[i] - nums[i - 1]
        print(beauty)

func()
```

This corrected code will yield the correct maximum beauty for each test case.
