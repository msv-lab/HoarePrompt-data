Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces, `i` is `i + 1`. If `nums[i] > x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. If `nums[i] < y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged and `x` is updated based on the previous condition.**
