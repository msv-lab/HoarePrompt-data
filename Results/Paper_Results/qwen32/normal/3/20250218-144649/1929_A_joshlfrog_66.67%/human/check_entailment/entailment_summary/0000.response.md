Reasoning:  
The provided program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array for each test case. However, the problem statement asks for the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n, after rearranging the array elements in any way to maximize this sum. The maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending or descending order, as this will maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

The program does not sort the array or consider the order of elements; it simply finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This approach does not solve the problem as described. The correct approach would involve sorting the array and then calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
