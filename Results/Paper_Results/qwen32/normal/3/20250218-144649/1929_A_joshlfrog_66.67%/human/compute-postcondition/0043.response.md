The code snippet assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `x`. Given the initial state, `i` has already been incremented by 1, so `x` will hold the value at the new index `i` in the list `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than `i + 1`; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces; `e` is `e + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `nums[i]`.**
