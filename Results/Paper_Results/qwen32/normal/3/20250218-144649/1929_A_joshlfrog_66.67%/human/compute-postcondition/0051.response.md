The code snippet provided overwrites the `nums` list with new integer values obtained from the input string split by spaces. The values of `x`, `y`, and `e` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, `x` (the maximum value in `nums`) and `y` (the minimum value in `nums`) will need to be recalculated based on the new `nums` list, but since the new values are not provided, we will only reflect the change in `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is a new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces; `x` is the maximum value in `nums`; `y` is the minimum value in `nums`; `e` is `e + 1`.**
