You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

    #State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `e` is equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times; for each of the `t` iterations, the loop processed a list `nums` of length `l` with integers derived from the input, and for each list, it calculated `x` as the maximum value and `y` as the minimum value, printing `x - y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to maximize the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when the array is rearranged. The beauty of an array \(a\) is calculated as:

\[
\text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})
\]

To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. The optimal strategy is to arrange the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. One such arrangement is to sort the array in ascending order and then rearrange it in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest elements.

However, the problem can be simplified. The maximum beauty can be achieved by simply taking the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. This is because the maximum difference between any two elements in the array will contribute to the maximum beauty when the array is optimally rearranged.

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` is initialized to 0, which is incorrect because the minimum possible value of `x` should be the smallest element in the array.
   - `y` is initialized to 100000000, which is a large number but not necessarily the correct initial value. It should be initialized to a very large number or the first element of the array.

2. **Finding Maximum and Minimum**:
   - The loop correctly finds the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values in the array.

3. **Printing the Result**:
   - The program prints the difference `x - y`, which is the correct approach to find the maximum beauty of the array.

### Conclusion

The program logic is correct, but there are issues with the initialization of `x` and `y`. However, the logic to find the maximum and minimum values and then printing their difference is correct. Given the constraints, the program will still work correctly because the initial values of `x` and `y` will be overwritten by the actual maximum and minimum values in the array.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
