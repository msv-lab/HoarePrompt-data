Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is reassigned to the integer value obtained from the input. The conditions on `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.
