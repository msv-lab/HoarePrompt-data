`l` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. Therefore, the Output State is `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, and `l` is an input integer.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `l` is an input integer**.
