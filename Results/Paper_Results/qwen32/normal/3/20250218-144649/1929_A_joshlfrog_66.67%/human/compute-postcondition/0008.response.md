The value of `x` is updated to be `nums[i]`. The values of `t`, `l`, `nums`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces, `x` is `nums[i]`, and `y` is 100000000.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input string split by spaces, `x` is `nums[i]`, and `y` is 100000000.**
