The code snippet `x = nums[i]` updates the variable `x` to the value of `nums[i]`. Given that `i` is 5, `x` will now hold the value of `nums[5]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `l` is a new input integer that must be greater than 5, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input string split by spaces, `e` is `e + 1`, `x` is `nums[5]`, `y` is updated to `nums[4]` if `nums[4]` is less than the original `y`; otherwise, `y` remains unchanged, `i` is 5**.
