The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the new input. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 5; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the new list `l`; `m` is the length of the new list `l`; If the integer 1 is in the new list `l`, then the list `l` includes the integer 1. Otherwise, the number 1 is not in the list `l`; `i` is 5.
