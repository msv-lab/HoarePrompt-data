Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the new list `l`; `m` is the length of the new list `l`; If the integer 1 is in the new list `l`, then the list `l` includes the integer 1. Otherwise, the number 1 is not in the list `l`; `i` is 4. The presence or absence of the integer 1 in the list `l` does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `e`, `m`, or `i`.**
