Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where the key rule is that on each turn, a player must remove the same number of stones from each non-empty pile, and the number of stones removed must be at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile.

The winner of the game depends on the initial configuration of the piles. Specifically, the game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum of the pile sizes). However, in this problem, the winning strategy can be simplified based on the presence of piles with exactly one stone.

#### Key Observations:
1. **If there is at least one pile with exactly one stone**, the second player (Bob) can always force a win. This is because:
   - If Alice removes a stone from the pile with one stone, it becomes empty.
   - If Alice removes more than one stone from the pile with one stone, it's impossible (since the pile only has one stone).
   - After Alice's move, Bob can always mirror Alice's move on other piles, ensuring that he can always make a move as long as Alice can.
2. **If there are no piles with exactly one stone**, the first player (Alice) can always force a win. This is because:
   - Alice can always remove stones in such a way that she leaves Bob in a position where there is at least one pile with exactly one stone, which we know from the previous point is a losing position for Bob.

### Program Analysis

Now, let's analyze the provided Python program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if 1 in l:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of piles, `n`.
   - It reads the list of stones in each pile, `l`.
   - It checks if there is any pile with exactly one stone (`if 1 in l`).
   - If there is at least one pile with exactly one stone, it prints "Bob".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the winning strategy based on the presence of piles with exactly one stone. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
