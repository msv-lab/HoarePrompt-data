The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'Bob'` to the output. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `e`, `m`, and `i` are described in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
