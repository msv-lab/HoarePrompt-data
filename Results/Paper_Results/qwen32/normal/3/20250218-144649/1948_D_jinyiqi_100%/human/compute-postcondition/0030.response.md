The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `count` to 0. The values of the existing variables `j` and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n // 2` is at least 2 is still valid after the code execution.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be such that `n // 2` is at least 2, `count` is 0**.
