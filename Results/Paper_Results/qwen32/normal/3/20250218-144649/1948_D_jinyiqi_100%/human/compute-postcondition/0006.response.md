Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters with `n` (length of `s`) being at least 2, `count` is 1, `j` must be less than `n`, and either `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `count` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
