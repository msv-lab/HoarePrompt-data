To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions described.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. This variable does not directly affect the `count` or the `print` statement.
- `s` is a list of characters with `n` (length of `s`) being at least 2.
- `j` must be less than `n`.
- `k` is `k + 1`. This means `k` is incremented by 1 before the `if` condition is checked.
- The `if` condition checks three conditions:
  - `s[k] == '?'`
  - `s[k + j] == '?'`
  - `s[k] == s[k + j]`
  
  If any of these conditions are true, `count` is either set to `j + 1` or incremented by 1, or reset to 1. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.

### Determining `count`:
- The value of `count` depends on the characters in the list `s` and the values of `k` and `j`.
- Since the exact values of `s`, `k`, and `j` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `count`.
- However, based on the conditions, we know that `count` can be either 0, 1, or `j + 1` (or some value between 1 and `j + 1` if it was incremented).

### Calculating the Output:
- The `print` statement is `print(count * 2)`.
- Given the possible values of `count`, the output will be:
  - If `count` is 0, `count * 2` will be 0.
  - If `count` is 1, `count * 2` will be 2.
  - If `count` is `j + 1`, `count * 2` will be `2 * (j + 1)`.
  - If `count` is some value between 1 and `j + 1`, `count * 2` will be some value between 2 and `2 * (j + 1)`.

### Conclusion:
The exact value of `count` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `s`, `k`, and `j`. However, we can describe the output based on the possible values of `count`.

Output: **count * 2 (where count is either 0, 1, or a value between 1 and j + 1 based on the conditions given)**
