Let's analyze the given task and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Replace question marks (`?`) in the string with lowercase Latin letters to maximize the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat.
2. **Tandem Repeat**: A string of even length where the first half equals the second half.
3. **Constraints**:
   - Multiple test cases (`t`).
   - Each string `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or `?`.
   - Total length of strings across all test cases does not exceed 5000.
4. **Output**: For each test case, print the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring after replacing `?`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Functionality**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` which:
     - Converts the input string `s` into a list of characters.
     - Iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats (`j`) from `n // 2` down to 1.
     - For each length `j`, it checks if there exists a tandem repeat of that length in the string:
       - It does this by iterating over all possible starting positions `k` from `0` to `n - j`.
       - It checks if characters at positions `k` and `k + j` are either `?` or equal.
       - If `j` consecutive positions meet this condition, it prints `2 * j` (length of the tandem repeat) and exits.
     - If no tandem repeat is found, it prints `0`.
2. **Logic**:
   - The program correctly identifies the longest possible tandem repeat length by checking from the largest possible length down to the smallest.
   - The use of `?` as a wildcard is correctly implemented by considering positions where `s[k]` or `s[k + j]` is `?` or where they are equal.
   - If a valid tandem repeat of length `j` is found, it prints `2 * j` and exits, which is the correct behavior.
   - If no tandem repeat is found, it correctly prints `0`.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described.
- It efficiently checks for the longest possible tandem repeat and handles question marks as wildcards.

**Correctness: True**
