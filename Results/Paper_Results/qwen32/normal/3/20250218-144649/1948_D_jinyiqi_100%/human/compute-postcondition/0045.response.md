To determine the output of the print statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the condition affecting the value of `count`.

Here's the breakdown of the given information:
- `j` is 2.
- `n` is at least 4 (though this detail is not directly relevant to the calculation of `count` in this context).
- `s[k]` is not equal to `?`.
- `s[k + j]` is not equal to `?`.
- `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.
- `k` is 3.

The condition affecting `count` is: If `count` was not equal to 2, then `count` is `count + 1`. Otherwise, `count` is 0.

However, the initial value of `count` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. To solve this problem, we need to make an assumption based on the given condition. Since the condition modifies `count` based on its previous value, we need to consider the possible states `count` could be in before the condition is applied.

Let's consider the two possible cases for `count` before the condition is applied:
1. `count` is not equal to 2.
2. `count` is equal to 2.

**Case 1: `count` is not equal to 2.**
- In this case, `count` is incremented by 1.
- Therefore, `count` becomes `count + 1`.

**Case 2: `count` is equal to 2.**
- In this case, `count` is reset to 0.

Since we don't know the initial value of `count`, we can't determine the exact value of `count` after the condition is applied. However, we can describe the output based on the two possible final values of `count`.

Let's assume the initial value of `count` is `x`:
- If `x != 2`, then `count` becomes `x + 1`.
- If `x == 2`, then `count` becomes 0.

In either case, the output will be `count * 2`. Therefore, the output will be:
- If `x != 2`, then `count * 2` is `(x + 1) * 2`.
- If `x == 2`, then `count * 2` is `0 * 2 = 0`.

Without knowing the exact initial value of `count`, we can't specify a single numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the possible final values of `count`.

Given the information, the output of the print statement will be `count * 2`, where `count` is determined by the condition described.

Output: **count * 2 (where count is determined by the condition: if count was not equal to 2, then count is count + 1; otherwise, count is 0)**
