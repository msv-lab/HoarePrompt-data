You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of time entries. For each of the following `t` lines, it reads a time in the format "hh:mm" and prints the time converted to a 12-hour format with AM/PM.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to convert a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. It reads the number of test cases and then processes each time string accordingly. The program manually maps each hour from '00' to '23' to its 12-hour format equivalent and assigns the correct period (AM or PM) based on the hour.

However, there are a few issues with the program:
1. The program uses `map(str, input().split(':'))` which is correct for splitting the time into hours and minutes, but it's unnecessary to map them to strings explicitly since `input().split(':')` already gives a list of strings.
2. The program manually checks each hour from '00' to '23' which is inefficient and prone to errors. It can be simplified using arithmetic operations.
3. The formatting of the output is correct, but the program uses `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')` which can be simplified to `print(f"{h1}:{m} {time}")` for better readability and efficiency.

Despite these points, the program does correctly convert the given 24-hour format times to the 12-hour format as per the provided examples. However, due to the inefficient and error-prone nature of the implementation, it is not optimal.

Correctness: **True** (The program does produce the correct output for the given examples, but the implementation is not optimal or efficient.)
