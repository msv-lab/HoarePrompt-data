To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the values of the variables involved based on the initial state provided:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440. This represents the time in minutes since midnight (1 minute to 24 hours).
2. **`h`**: The hour part of the input time as a string. This is derived from `t` as `h = str(t // 60)`. For example, if `t` is 130, `h` would be '02'.
3. **`m`**: The minute part of the input time as a string. This is derived from `t` as `m = str(t % 60)`. For example, if `t` is 130, `m` would be '10'.
4. **`m1`**: The minute part of the input time as an integer. This is the same as `m` but as an integer, `m1 = t % 60`.
5. **`h1`**: This variable is set based on the value of `h`. It essentially converts the 24-hour format to a 12-hour format. The mapping is as follows:
   - '01' to '11' map to '01' to '11' respectively.
   - '12' maps to '12'.
   - '13' to '23' map to '01' to '11' respectively.
   - '00' maps to '12'.
6. **`time`**: This variable is set based on the value of `h` to indicate whether the time is 'AM' or 'PM'. It is 'AM' if `h` is '01' to '11', and 'PM' if `h` is '12' or '13' to '23'.

Given these mappings, let's derive the output step-by-step:

- **`h1`**: This is determined based on the value of `h`. For example, if `h` is '13', `h1` would be '01'. If `h` is '07', `h1` would be '07'.
- **`m`**: This is the minute part of the time as a string. For example, if `t` is 130, `m` would be '10'.
- **`time`**: This is 'AM' if `h` is '01' to '11', and 'PM' if `h` is '12' to '23'. For example, if `h` is '13', `time` would be 'PM'.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

This statement will concatenate `h1`, ':', `m`, ' ', and `time` without any separator.

Let's consider an example to illustrate:
- Suppose `t = 130`.
- `h = str(130 // 60) = '02'`.
- `m = str(130 % 60) = '10'`.
- `h1` would be '02' (since '02' maps to '02').
- `time` would be 'AM' (since '02' is between '01' and '11').

The output would be:
Output: **02:10 AM**

However, if `t = 1330`:
- `h = str(1330 // 60) = '22'`.
- `m = str(1330 % 60) = '10'`.
- `h1` would be '10' (since '22' maps to '10').
- `time` would be 'PM' (since '22' is between '12' and '23').

The output would be:
Output: **10:10 PM**

Given the general nature of the problem, the output will depend on the specific value of `t` provided. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables:

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the 12-hour format hour derived from h, m is the minute part of the time, and time is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour)**
