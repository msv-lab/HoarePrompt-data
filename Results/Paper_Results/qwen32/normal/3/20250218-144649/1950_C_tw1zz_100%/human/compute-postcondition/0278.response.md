To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the transformation applied to each time string "hh:mm" in the input. The loop converts the 24-hour format to a 12-hour format with AM or PM suffixes.

Here's a summary of the transformation:
- For hours 01 to 11, the hour remains the same, and the time is "AM".
- For hour 12, the hour remains 12, and the time is "PM".
- For hours 13 to 23, the hour is reduced by 12, and the time is "PM".
- For hour 00, the hour becomes 12, and the time is "AM".

Given this transformation, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be a series of lines, each representing the converted time in the 12-hour format with AM or PM suffixes, corresponding to each input time string.

Output State: **Each of the t lines will be in the format "h1 : m AM" or "h1 : m PM" where h1 is the hour in 12-hour format and m is the minute part of the input time.**

In Natural Language: 
The output state after all iterations of the loop will consist of `t` lines, where each line represents the input time converted from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with the appropriate AM or PM suffix. For example, "03:45" will be converted to "03:45 AM", "14:30" will be converted to "02:30 PM", and so on.
