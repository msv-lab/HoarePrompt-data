Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is 'AM' if `h` was '11', 'PM' if `h` was '12' or '13', and remains an empty string otherwise; `h1` is '11' if `h` was '11', '12' if `h` was '12', '01' if `h` was '13', '02' if `h` was '14', '03' if `h` was '15', '04' if `h` was '16', '05' if `h` was '17', '06' if `h` was '18', '07' if `h` was '19', '08' if `h` was '20', '09' if `h` was '21', '10' if `h` was '22', '11' if `h` was '23', '12' if `h` was '00', and remains an empty string for any other value of `h`.**
