Reasoning: 
The provided program correctly converts a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format as per the given examples. The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to map each hour from '00' to '23' to its 12-hour format equivalent and assigns the correct period (AM or PM) based on the hour. The output formatting is correct as well, producing the expected results.

However, the original assessment highlights several inefficiencies and potential issues:
1. The use of `map(str, input().split(':'))` is unnecessary because `input().split(':')` already provides a list of strings.
2. Manually checking each hour from '00' to '23' is inefficient and error-prone. A more optimal approach would involve using arithmetic operations to determine the 12-hour format and the period (AM or PM).
3. The print statement can be simplified for better readability and efficiency.

Despite these inefficiencies, the program does produce the correct output for the given examples, which aligns with the problem description and the provided test cases.

Final: **True**
