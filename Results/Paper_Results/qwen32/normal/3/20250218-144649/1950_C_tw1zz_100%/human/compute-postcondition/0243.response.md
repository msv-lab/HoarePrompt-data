The code assigns the string `'08'` to the variable `h1`. The values of `t`, `h`, `m`, `m1`, and `time` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the new hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the new minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `h1` is `'08'`; `time` is ''**.
