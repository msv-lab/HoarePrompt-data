Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement. It handles each hour from '00' to '23' and assigns the correct hour in 12-hour format along with the appropriate AM or PM designation. The program also ensures that the output format matches the required format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" with leading zeroes preserved.

However, the implementation can be significantly simplified and made more efficient by using a few conditional statements and arithmetic operations instead of listing every possible hour case. Here is a more concise version of the same logic:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        period = 'AM'
        if h >= 12:
            period = 'PM'
            if h > 12:
                h -= 12
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
        print(f"{h:02}:{m:02} {period}")

#State: Each of the t lines will be in the format "h1 : m AM" or "h1 : m PM" where h1 is the hour in 12-hour format and m is the minute part of the input time.
```

Despite the inefficiency, the given program still produces the correct output for all valid inputs as per the problem description. Thus, the correctness of the program based on the provided logic and states is:

Correctness: **True**
