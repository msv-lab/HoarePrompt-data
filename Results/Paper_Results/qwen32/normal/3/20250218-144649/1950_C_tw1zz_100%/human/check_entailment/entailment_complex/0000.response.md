Reasoning: The program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM. It checks each possible hour value (from '00' to '23') and assigns the corresponding 12-hour format hour and AM/PM designation. The program also correctly maintains leading zeros for single-digit hours in the 12-hour format. The output format matches the required specifications, and it handles all edge cases, including midnight ('00:00') and noon ('12:00').

Given the provided example and the program's logic, it appears that the program will produce the correct output for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
