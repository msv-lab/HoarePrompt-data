Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the new hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the new minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time. If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, if `h` is one of '02' to '11', `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is one of '13' to '23', `h1` is `h` minus 12 and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. For all other values of `h` except the ones mentioned, `h1` remains '' and `time` remains ''.**
