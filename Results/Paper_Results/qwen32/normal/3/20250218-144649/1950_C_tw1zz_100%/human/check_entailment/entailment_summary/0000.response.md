### Reasoning:

The provided program correctly converts the given time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. The program uses a series of conditional statements to map each hour in the 24-hour format to its corresponding hour in the 12-hour format and assigns the appropriate AM/PM designation. 

Here are some key points that support the correctness of the program:

1. **Handling AM Hours**: The program correctly maps hours from "01" to "11" to "01" to "11" AM, respectively.
2. **Handling PM Hours**: The program correctly maps hours from "13" to "23" to "01" to "11" PM, respectively.
3. **Handling Midnight (00:00)**: The program correctly converts "00:00" to "12:00 AM".
4. **Handling Noon (12:00)**: The program correctly converts "12:00" to "12:00 PM".
5. **Preservation of Minutes**: The minutes (`mm`) are preserved and printed as is.
6. **Output Format**: The output is formatted as "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" with leading zeros preserved.

The execution summary confirms that the function reads the number of test cases and processes each time entry correctly, producing the expected output.
