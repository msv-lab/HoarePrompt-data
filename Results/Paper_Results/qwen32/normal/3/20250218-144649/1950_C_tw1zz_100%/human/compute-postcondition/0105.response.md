Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time; `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time. If `h` is '18', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '19', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '20', then `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '21', then `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '22', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '23', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. For all other values of `h` (excluding '01' to '23'), `h1` and `time` remain unchanged.**
