The code sets the variable `time` to the string `'AM'`. This change affects only the `time` variable, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the new hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the new minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `h1` is '05'; `time` is 'AM'**.
