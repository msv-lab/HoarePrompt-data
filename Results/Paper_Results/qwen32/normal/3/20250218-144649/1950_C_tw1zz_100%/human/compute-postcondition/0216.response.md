The code snippet assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `h`, `m`, `m1`, `h1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the new hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the new minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `h1` is '06'; `time` is 'AM'**.
