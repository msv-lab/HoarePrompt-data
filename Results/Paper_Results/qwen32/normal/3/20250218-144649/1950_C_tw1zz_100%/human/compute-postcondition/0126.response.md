The code snippet `h1, m1 = '', m` sets `h1` to an empty string and `m1` to the value of `m`. The other variables (`t`, `h`, `m`, `time`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is a string. `h1` is an empty string.**
