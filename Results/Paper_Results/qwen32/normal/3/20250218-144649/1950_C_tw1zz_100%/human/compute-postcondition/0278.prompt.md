Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440. Each of the following t lines contains a string s of length 5 with the format "hh:mm" where hh is a two-digit integer representing the hour from 00 to 23, and mm is a two-digit integer representing the minute from 00 to 59.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))
    h1, m1 = '', m
    time = ''
    if h == '01':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '02':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '03':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '04':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '05':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '06':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '07':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '08':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '09':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '10':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '11':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '12':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '13':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '14':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '15':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '16':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '17':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '18':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '19':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '20':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '21':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '22':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '23':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '00':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'AM'
    print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time; `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; `time` is a string. If `h` equals '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '03', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '04', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '05', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '06', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '07', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '08', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '09', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '10', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '11', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '13', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '14', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '15', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '16', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '17', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '18', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '19', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '20', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '21', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '22', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '23', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. For all other values of `h` (excluding '00', '06' to '23'), `h1` and `time` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `h1` is '01' if `h` is '01', '02' if `h` is '02', '03' if `h` is '03', '04' if `h` is '04', '05' if `h` is '05', '06' if `h` is '06', '07' if `h` is '07', '08' if `h` is '08', '09' if `h` is '09', '10' if `h` is '10', '11' if `h` is '11', '12' if `h` is '12' or '00', '01' if `h` is '13', '02' if `h` is '14', '03' if `h` is '15', '04' if `h` is '16', '05' if `h` is '17', '06' if `h` is '18', '07' if `h` is '19', '08' if `h` is '20', '09' if `h` is '21', '10' if `h` is '22', '11' if `h` is '23', and remains an empty string otherwise; `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', and 'PM' if `h` is '12' or '13'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the new hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the new minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time. If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, if `h` is one of '02' to '11', `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is one of '13' to '23', `h1` is `h` minus 12 and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. For all other values of `h` except the ones mentioned, `h1` remains '' and `time` remains ''.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
