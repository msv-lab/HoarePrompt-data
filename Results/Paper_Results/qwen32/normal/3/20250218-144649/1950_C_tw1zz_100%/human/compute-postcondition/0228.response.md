The code snippet assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The other variables (`t`, `h`, `m`, `m1`, and `h1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the new hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the new minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `h1` is '12'; `time` is 'PM'**.
