Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is [1], `a` is [1, -1]**.

The code snippet `a = [1, -1]` changes the value of `a` to `[1, -1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
