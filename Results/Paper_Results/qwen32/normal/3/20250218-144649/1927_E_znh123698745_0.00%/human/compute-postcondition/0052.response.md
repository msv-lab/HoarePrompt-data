To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the `answer` and `a` lists.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `answer` starts as `[1]`.
   - `a` starts as `[1, -1]`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`.
   - For each `i`, if `i` is odd (`(-1) ** i == -1`), the element at the index `a[-1]` in `array` is appended to `answer`, and `a[-1]` is decremented.
   - If `i` is even (`(-1) ** i == 1`), the element at the index `a[0]` in `array` is appended to `answer`, and `a[0]` is incremented.

3. **Detailed Iteration:**
   - **Iteration 1 (i = 1, odd):** `answer` becomes `[1, array[-1]]` (since `a[-1]` is -1, it takes the last element of `array`), and `a[-1]` becomes -2.
   - **Iteration 2 (i = 2, even):** `answer` becomes `[1, array[-1], array[1]]`, and `a[0]` becomes 2.
   - **Iteration 3 (i = 3, odd):** `answer` becomes `[1, array[-1], array[1], array[-2]]`, and `a[-1]` becomes -3.
   - This pattern continues until `i = n - 1`.

4. **Final State:**
   - After all iterations, `answer` will contain the first element `1`, followed by alternating elements from the end and the beginning of `array`.
   - `a` will have values that reflect the last indices used in the loop.

Given that `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, the final `answer` list will be constructed by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements of `array`.

**Output State:**
- `answer` will be `[1, n, 1, n-1, 2, n-2, ...]` until all elements from `array` are included.
- `a` will be `[n//2 + 1, -n//2 - 1]` if `n` is even, or `[n//2 + 1, -n//2 - 2]` if `n` is odd, since the loop alternates between the start and end of the `array`.

**Output State: **answer is constructed by starting with 1 and then alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements of array until all elements are included, a is [n//2 + 1, -n//2 - 1] if n is even, or [n//2 + 1, -n//2 - 2] if n is odd.**

In simple terms, the `answer` list will be a sequence starting with 1 and then alternating between the largest and smallest remaining numbers from the `array` until all numbers are included. The `a` list will reflect the last indices used in the loop, adjusted based on whether `n` is even or odd.
