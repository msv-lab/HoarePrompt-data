The code snippet `a[0] += 1` increments the value at the first index of the list `a` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `answer`) are not directly affected by this operation, but we need to reflect the change in `a[0]` in the output state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[0] - 1]`, `a[0]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `a[0]` is increased by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `answer` remain as they were initially described, except that `answer` now includes an element from `array` at the index that was originally `a[0]` before it was incremented.
