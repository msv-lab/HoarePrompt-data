Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `i` is `n`, `array` remains unchanged if `i` is even and the last element of `a` is decreased by 1 if `i` is odd, `answer` includes the element at the index `a[-1]` from `array` if `i` is odd, and includes `array[a[0] - 1]` if `i` is even, and `a[0]` is increased by 1 if `i` is even.**
