The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the element at the index specified by `a[0]` from the `array` to the `answer` list. Given that `array` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `a` is not defined in the initial state, we can't determine the exact value of `a[0]`. However, we can describe the change to the `answer` list.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second input integer, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `answer` list has an additional element which is `array[a[0]]`.**
