To determine the output of the `print(*answer)` statement, we need to understand how the `answer` list is constructed based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (though `t` is not directly used in the construction of `answer`).
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `k` is the second input integer (though `k` is not directly used in the construction of `answer`).
- `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- `answer` is a list constructed in a specific order: [1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., m], where `m` is the middle element if `n` is odd.
- `a` is a list containing the integers [n, -n].

### Construction of `answer`:
The `answer` list is constructed by taking elements from the `array` in a specific alternating order. The order alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements in the `array`. This continues until all elements are included in the `answer` list.

### Example Construction:
Let's consider an example to illustrate how `answer` is constructed.

#### Example: n = 5
- `array` = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- `answer` construction:
  1. Take the smallest element: 1
  2. Take the largest element: 5
  3. Take the next smallest element: 2
  4. Take the next largest element: 4
  5. Take the middle element: 3

So, `answer` = [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]

### General Case:
For a general `n`, the `answer` list is constructed as follows:
- If `n` is odd, the middle element is `n // 2 + 1`.
- If `n` is even, there is no single middle element, and the construction stops when all elements are used.

### Output:
The `print(*answer)` statement will print the elements of the `answer` list separated by spaces.

#### Output Description:
The `answer` list is constructed by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements in the `array` list, starting with the smallest element and ending with the largest or middle element if `n` is odd.

### Final Answer:
Output: **1 n 2 n-1 3 n-2 ... m (where m is the middle element if n is odd, or the last element in the sequence if n is even)**

This description precisely captures the construction of the `answer` list based on the given initial state.
