You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` and two lists `a` and `b`, each of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost to reach from position `m` to position 0, considering the costs specified in lists `a` and `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding
Kirill is in a queue and wants to move to one of the first `m` positions with the minimum cost. The cost to move to position `j` from position `i` is `a_j` plus the sum of `b_k` for all `j < k < i`. Kirill can perform this operation multiple times.

### Program Analysis
The program iterates through the queue from the last person to the first, calculating the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` positions.

#### Key Points:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `total` to 0 and `best` to a very large number (`sys.float_info.max`).
2. **Loop**: It iterates from the last person to the first person in the queue.
3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the current position `v` is within the first `m` positions (`v <= pos_final`), it updates `best` if the current total cost plus `a[v]` is less than the current `best`.
   - It then adds either `a[v]` or `b[v]` to `total`, depending on which is smaller.
4. **Output**: After processing all people, it prints the `best` cost.

#### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program does not correctly account for the cost of passing through people when moving to a position `j`. It should add the sum of `b_k` for all `j < k < i` when considering the cost to move to position `j`.
2. **Logic for Best Cost**: The program updates `best` only if `v <= pos_final`, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where moving through a person might lead to a better cost even if that person is not within the first `m` positions initially.

### Correctness
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
