The given code snippet updates the value of `custo_pra_passar_b` by reading a new list of integers from the input. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `custo_pra_passar_b` will be replaced with the new list provided by the input, while `v`, `total`, `best`, `c`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final` will retain their initial values.

Output State: **`v` is -1, `total` is 120, `best` is 50, `c` is 9, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are the values provided by the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is the list of integers provided by the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is the new list of integers provided by the input.**
