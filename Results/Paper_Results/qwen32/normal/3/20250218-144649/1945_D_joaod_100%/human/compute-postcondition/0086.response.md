Output State: **`v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; otherwise, `best` remains unchanged, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input.**

In simpler terms: The `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. If the new `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `best`, then `best` is updated to this new value. The variable `c` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
