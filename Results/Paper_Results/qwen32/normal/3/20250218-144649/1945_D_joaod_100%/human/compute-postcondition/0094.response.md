The `print(best)` statement will print the value of the variable `best` as described in the initial state.

From the initial state, we know that:
- `v` is -1
- `total` is 120
- `best` is 50
- `c` is incremented by 6 (but the initial value of `c` is not given, so this information is not directly relevant to the value of `best`)
- `na_frente` is 5
- `pos_final` is 3
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is [15, 25, 35, 45, 55]

The variable `best` has an explicit value of 50.

Therefore, the `print(best)` statement will output the value 50.

Output: **50**
