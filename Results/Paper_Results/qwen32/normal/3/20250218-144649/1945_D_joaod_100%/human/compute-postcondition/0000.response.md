Output State: **`cases` is an input integer, t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. b is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `cases` is now set to the integer input by the user. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`) retain their initial descriptions and values as they have not been modified by the code snippet.
