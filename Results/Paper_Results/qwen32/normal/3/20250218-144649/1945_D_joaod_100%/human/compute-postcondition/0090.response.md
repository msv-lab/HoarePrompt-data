The code snippet `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged unless `total` is used elsewhere in the code, which it is not in the provided snippet.

Output State: **`v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is smaller than the current `best`; otherwise, `best` remains unchanged, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 1, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers from the input.**

In simpler terms: The value of `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The value of `best` may change if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and the new `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is smaller than the current `best`. The variable `c` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
