The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns the resulting list to `custo_pra_passar_b`. The other variables (`v`, `total`, `best`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is -1, `total` is the accumulated minimum cost from `na_frente` to `0`, `best` is the minimum `total` when `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input.**
