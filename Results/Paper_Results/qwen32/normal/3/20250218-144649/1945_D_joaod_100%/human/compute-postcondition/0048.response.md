The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which is the loop variable in the `for` loop. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `c` to determine if the loop can execute one more time.

Given that the loop iterates over the range `cases`, the loop will continue as long as `c` is less than `cases`. At the end of the previous iteration, `c` would have taken on the value of the current iteration. To proceed to the next iteration, `c` needs to be incremented by 1.

The states of `v`, `total`, and `best` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted based on the loop's iteration logic.

State: **`v` is -1, `total` is the accumulated minimum cost from `na_frente` to `0`, `best` is the minimum `total` when `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`, `c` is incremented by 1**
