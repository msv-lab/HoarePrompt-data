Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: - After all cards are processed, `trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit.
   - `answers` will contain strings representing pairs of cards from non-trump suits, sorted by rank.
   - `suits` will have `None` for all suits that had at least one card processed (i.e., all suits that were part of pairs in `answers`).

Given this understanding, the final output state can be described as:

Output State:
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, except the last element which was removed and used in the `answers` list. `answers` will contain the original strings plus a new string formatted as '{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'. `suits` is a dictionary with at least one entry, e.g., `{'hearts': None}`. If `rank` is `None`, the current value of `rank` remains `None`. Otherwise, the postcondition is the same as the precondition since there is no else part to modify the state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, except the last element which was removed and used in the `answers` list if `trumps` was not empty. `answers` will contain the original strings plus a new string formatted as '10spades {last_trump_card}{trump}' if `trumps` was not empty. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns nothing (None). `suits` is a dictionary with at least two entries, e.g., `{'hearts': None, 'spades': 10}`. `suit` is 'spades' and `rank` is 10, and these values remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, except the last element which was removed and used in the `answers` list if `trumps` was not empty. If `trumps` was not empty, `answers` will contain the original strings plus a new string formatted as 'Nonehearts {last_trump_card}{trump}'. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns None. `suits` remains a dictionary with at least two entries, e.g., `{'hearts': None, 'spades': 10}`. `suit` is 'hearts' and `rank` is None.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
