Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, `trump` is the input character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}, and `cards` is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings where each string consists of a rank from '2' to '9' and a suit from 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing `rank`. Otherwise, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing a new string formed from the sorted rank and the suit value, concatenated with the `suit` character if `suits[suit]` was not `None`, and `suits[suit]` is now `None` if it was not `None`, otherwise `suits[suit]` is now `rank`.**
