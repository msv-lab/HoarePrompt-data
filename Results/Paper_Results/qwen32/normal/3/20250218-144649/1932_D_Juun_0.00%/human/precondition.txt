The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds. This is followed by a character representing the trump suit, which is one of "CDHS". Then, there is a line containing 2n cards, where each card is represented by a two-character string. The first character is the rank of the card, which is one of "23456789", and the second character is the suit of the card, which is one of "CDHS". All cards are distinct within each test case. The total number of test cases is t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
