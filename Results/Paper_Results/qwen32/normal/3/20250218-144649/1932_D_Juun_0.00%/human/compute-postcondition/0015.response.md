Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16, `trump` is the input character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}, and `cards` is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings where each string consists of a rank from '2' to '9' and a suit from 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is a list containing a new string formed from the sorted rank and the suit value, concatenated with the `suit` character if `suits[suit]` was not `None`, otherwise `answers` is an empty list; `suits` is a dictionary with keys {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'} where the value for the key `suit` is now `None` if `suits[suit]` was not `None`, otherwise the value for the key `suit` is now `rank`; `rank` is the first character of `card` (the rank); `suit` is the second character of `card` (the suit); and `suit` is not equal to `trump`.**
