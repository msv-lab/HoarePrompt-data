The code appends a formatted string to the `answers` list using the values of `rank`, `suit`, and the last element of `trumps` which is then removed by `trumps.pop()`. Since `rank` is 10 and `suit` is 'spades', and `trump` is the suit symbol for the trump suit, the string added to `answers` will be in the format '10spades {last_trump_card}{trump}'. The `trumps` list will have one less element after this operation.

Output State: **`trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, except the last element which was removed and used in the `answers` list; `answers` will contain the original strings plus a new string formatted as '10spades {last_trump_card}{trump}'; `suits` is a dictionary with at least two entries, e.g., `{'hearts': None, 'spades': 10}`; `suit` is 'spades' and `rank` is 10.**
