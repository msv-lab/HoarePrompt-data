Postcondition: **`trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, except the last element which was removed and used in the `answers` list if `trumps` was not empty. If `trumps` was not empty, `answers` will contain the original strings plus a new string formatted as 'Nonehearts {last_trump_card}{trump}'. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns None. `suits` remains a dictionary with at least two entries, e.g., `{'hearts': None, 'spades': 10}`. `suit` is 'hearts' and `rank` is None.**
