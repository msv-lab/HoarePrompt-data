Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input values including the trump suit and a list of cards. It processes the cards to form pairs, prioritizing cards of the trump suit. It prints pairs of cards, ensuring that if a card of a non-trump suit is left unpaired, it is paired with the highest available trump card. If there are leftover trump cards that cannot be paired, it prints them in descending order. The function does not return any value and outputs the results directly.**
