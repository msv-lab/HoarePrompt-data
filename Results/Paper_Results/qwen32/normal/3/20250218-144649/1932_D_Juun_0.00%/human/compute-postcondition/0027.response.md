Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump` is the input character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; `cards` is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings where each string consists of a rank from '2' to '9' and a suit from 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'; `trumps` is a list containing the `rank` of the last card in `cards` if the `suit` of the last card is equal to `trump` and now also contains the `rank` of the next card in `cards`; otherwise, `trumps` is an empty list and now contains the `rank` of the next card in `cards`; `answers` is a list containing a new string formed from the sorted rank and the suit value, concatenated with the `suit` character if `suits[suit]` was not `None`. If `suits[suit]` was not `None`, it is now `None`; otherwise, it is now `rank`; `card` is the next card from the input string; `rank` is the rank of the next card in `cards`; `suit` is the suit of the next card in `cards`.**

In natural language: The `trumps` list now includes the `rank` of the next card in `cards`, regardless of whether the `suit` of the last card matched `trump` or not. All other variables remain unchanged.
