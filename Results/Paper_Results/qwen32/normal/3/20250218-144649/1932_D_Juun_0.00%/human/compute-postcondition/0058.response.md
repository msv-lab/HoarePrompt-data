Output State: **`trumps` is a sorted empty list, `answers` contains all the formatted strings created during the loop's execution, and `suits` has `None` for all suits that had at least one card processed.**

In simple terms, the `trumps` list remains empty but is now sorted (which has no effect since it's empty). The `answers` list and the `suits` dictionary remain unchanged.
