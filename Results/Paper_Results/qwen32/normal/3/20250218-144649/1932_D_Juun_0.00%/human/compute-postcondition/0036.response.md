Output State: **`trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the trump suit, `answers` will contain strings representing pairs of cards from non-trump suits, sorted by rank, `suits` is a dictionary with at least one entry, e.g., `{'hearts': None}`, the current value of `rank` is `None`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply passes control to the next iteration of the current loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the state remains unchanged.
