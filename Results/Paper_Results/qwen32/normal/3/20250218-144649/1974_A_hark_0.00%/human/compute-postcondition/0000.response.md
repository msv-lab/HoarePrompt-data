The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means that the value of `t` will be updated to the integer value provided by the input. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and this precondition still holds after the input is taken. The variables `x` and `y` are mentioned to exist within each test case but are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99.**
