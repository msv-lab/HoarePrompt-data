To provide an accurate output state, I need to know the definition of `func_2()`. Since the function `func_2()` is not provided, I cannot determine how it affects the variables `t`, `x`, and `y`. If you can provide the definition of `func_2()`, I can accurately simulate the execution and provide the output state.

Without the definition of `func_2()`, the best I can do is assume that `func_2()` does not alter the values of `t`, `x`, and `y`. Therefore, the output state would be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99**.
