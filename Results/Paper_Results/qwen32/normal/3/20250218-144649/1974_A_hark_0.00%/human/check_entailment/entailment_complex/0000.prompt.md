Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Functions:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b
    #The program returns the smaller of the two integers a or b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters and returns the smaller of the two.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory1 is 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1, and bxsfory is math.ceil(y / 2))
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is a non-negative integer greater than 0)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99. At least one of `x` or `y` is 0. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the conditions remain the same. Otherwise, it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0.
        #State: `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99. At least one of `x` or `y` is 0. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the conditions remain the same. Otherwise, it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0.
    #State: `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` and `y` remains the same, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is `0` if `x` <= 0 else `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is 0, and the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the input, where `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`. It then calculates and prints a value based on the conditions of `x` and `y`. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it computes a specific formula involving `x` and `y` and prints the result. If either `x` or `y` is 0, it prints a simpler value derived from the non-zero variable or 0 if both are 0.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers x and y such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it processes two integers `x` and `y` (where 0 <= x, y <= 99) by calling `func_2`. The overall effect is that for each test case, some action is performed (as defined in `func_2`), although the specific action is not detailed in the provided code.
