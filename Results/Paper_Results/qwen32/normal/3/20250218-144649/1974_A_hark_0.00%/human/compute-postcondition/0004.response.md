To accurately determine the output state, we need to know the definition and behavior of the function `func_2()`. Since the definition of `func_2()` is not provided, we cannot determine how it affects the variables `t`, `x`, and `y`.

However, based on the given information, if `func_2()` does not modify `t`, `x`, or `y`, the output state would be the same as the initial state. If `func_2()` modifies these variables, we would need that specific information to provide an accurate output state.

Given the lack of details about `func_2()`, the safest assumption is that it does not modify the variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99**.
