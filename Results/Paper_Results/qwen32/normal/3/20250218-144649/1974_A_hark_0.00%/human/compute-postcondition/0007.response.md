To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    func_2()
```

This loop will execute `func_2()` exactly `t` times. The provided output states indicate the state of the variables `t`, `x`, and `y` after each iteration. However, the description of the output states includes a condition that `t` must be within a certain range each time, which is not directly relevant to the final state after the loop completes. The key point is that the loop will run `t` times, and the values of `x` and `y` will not be affected by the loop head or body as per the given information.

Thus, after the loop has executed `t` times, the value of `t` will be 0 (since the loop iterates `t` times and `t` is decremented by 1 each time, starting from its initial value). The values of `x` and `y` will remain unchanged as they are not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:
Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 99**

In natural language: After the loop has finished executing, `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times and decrements `t` by 1 each time. The values of `x` and `y` will remain the same as they were initially, since they are not modified within the loop.
