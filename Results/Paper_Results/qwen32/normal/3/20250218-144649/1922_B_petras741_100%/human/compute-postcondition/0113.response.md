The code snippet provided appends the current value of `j` to the `eta` list. Given the initial state, `j` is 0, so `0` will be appended to the `eta` list. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer and must be at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is the count of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list containing the integer `0`, `eta_ln` is the number of unique values in `w`, `rho` is the total count of all elements in `w`, `j` is 0, and `q[j]` is greater than 0.**
