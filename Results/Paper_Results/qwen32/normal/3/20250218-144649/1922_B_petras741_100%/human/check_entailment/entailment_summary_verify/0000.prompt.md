You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    buffer = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
        if n >= 3:
            q = [0 for j in range(n + 1)]
            for j in range(n):
                q[w[j]] += 1
            eta = []
            for j in range(n + 1):
                if q[j] > 0:
                    eta.append(j)
            eta_ln = len(eta)
            rho = q[eta[0]]
            if eta_ln == 1:
                print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
            else:
                res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
                for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                    rho += q[eta[j]]
                print(res)
        else:
            print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of ways to choose three distinct indices from a list of integers such that the integers at those indices are the same. If the list has fewer than three elements, it prints 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The current implementation seems to be counting combinations of sticks based on their lengths but does not check the triangle inequality condition, which is essential for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

### Triangle Inequality Condition:
For three lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \le b \le c\)) to form a non-degenerate triangle, the following must hold:
\[ a + b > c \]

### Issues in the Provided Code:
The code does not check the triangle inequality condition. It only counts combinations of sticks based on their frequencies and lengths without verifying if they can actually form a triangle.

### Example to Demonstrate the Issue:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
The correct output should be `2` as explained in the problem description, but the provided code will not correctly compute this because it does not check the triangle inequality condition.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Sort the lengths of the sticks.
2. Use three nested loops or a more optimized approach to check all combinations of three sticks and verify if they satisfy the triangle inequality condition.

Here is a corrected version of the code that checks the triangle inequality condition:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lengths = [2**x for x in a]
        lengths.sort()
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                k = j + 1
                while k < n and lengths[i] + lengths[j] > lengths[k]:
                    k += 1
                count += k - j - 1
        print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected code sorts the lengths of the sticks and uses a nested loop to check all combinations of three sticks, ensuring that they satisfy the triangle inequality condition.
