The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer and at least 1. At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 2 (since it is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration), and `n` must be at least 2 (since `j` should be less than `n + 1`).

State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer and at least 2**
