The given code snippet updates the value of `rho` by adding `q[eta[j]]` to it. No other variables are affected by this operation. The value of `rho` is now the sum of its previous value and `q[eta[j]]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer and must be at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `i` is `k + 2`, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is the count of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list containing all unique values in `w` with `eta_ln` greater than 1, `eta_ln` is the number of unique values in `w` and must be greater than 1, `rho` is the count of the first unique value in `w` plus `q[eta[j]]` plus `q[eta[j]]`, `j` is 1, `res` is updated to its previous value plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.**
