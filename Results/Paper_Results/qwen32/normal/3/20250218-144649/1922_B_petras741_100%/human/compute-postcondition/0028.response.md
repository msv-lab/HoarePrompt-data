Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n >= 3 (and 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `eta` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to n for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. The length of `eta` (denoted as `eta_ln`) is 1.**
