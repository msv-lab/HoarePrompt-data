The given code snippet increments the `res` variable by a specific expression involving `q[eta[j]]` and `rho`. The expression added to `res` is `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`. 

Since the initial state specifies that `res` is already updated with a complex formula, the only change here is the addition of the new term to `res`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that n >= 3 (and 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 <= a_i <= n, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing all the indices from 0 to n for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta` and must be greater than 1, `rho` is `rho + q[eta[j]]`, `res` is updated to its previous value plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.**
