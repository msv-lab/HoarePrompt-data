Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list that contains the integer `w` if `w` is an integer and `w >= x - 1`. If `w` does not satisfy these conditions, `M` remains an empty list.**
