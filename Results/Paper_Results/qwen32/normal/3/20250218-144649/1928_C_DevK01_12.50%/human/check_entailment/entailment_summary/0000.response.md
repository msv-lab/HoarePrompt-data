### Reasoning:
Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Pattern of Settling**: The sequence of numbers assigned to students follows a pattern that repeats every `2k - 2` positions. The first `k` positions are numbered `1, 2, ..., k`, followed by `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.
2. **Finding k**: Given a student's position `n` and the number `x` they received, we need to find all possible values of `k` that satisfy the conditions under which `x` is assigned to position `n`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers, `n` and `x`.
2. **Condition Check**: The program first checks if `(n + x) % 2 != 0`. If true, it prints `0` because the conditions for a valid `k` cannot be met.
3. **Finding Possible k Values**:
   - The program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` where `y = n + x`. This function aims to find factors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to find additional factors of `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The results from both calls are combined, converted to a set to remove duplicates, and the length of this set is printed as the number of valid `k` values.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of k**: The program does not correctly calculate the possible values of `k`. The logic for determining `k` should involve checking the position `n` within the repeating pattern of length `2k - 2` and ensuring that `x` matches the expected number at that position.
- **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is intended to find factors, but it does not correctly represent the logic needed to determine valid `k` values. The factors found do not necessarily correspond to valid `k` values based on the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the number of valid `k` values based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
