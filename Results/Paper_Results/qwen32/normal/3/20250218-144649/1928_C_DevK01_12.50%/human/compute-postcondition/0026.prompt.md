Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list that contains the integer `w` if `w` is an integer and `w >= x - 1`. If `w` does not satisfy these conditions, `M` remains an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
    if q % i == 0:
        if i >= x - 1:
            M += [i]
        if q // i >= x - 1:
            M += [q // i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. If the first element of the first tuple in `q` (which is `n`) is divisible by `i`, `M` also contains `i` and the result of `q[0][0] // i` if `q[0][0] // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Additionally, if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` contains `i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` for any tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, then `M` also contains the new value of `n // i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. If `q` modulo `i` equals 0, then for each tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, if `n // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is updated to include `n // i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged as a list containing only the integer `w`. `i` is 4, and `w` is greater than 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
