Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. If `q` modulo `i` equals 0, then for each tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, if `n // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` is updated to include `n // i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged as a list containing only the integer `w`. `i` is 4, and `w` is greater than 4.**
