The code snippet `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. The initial state specifies that `M` is a list containing the integer `w` where `w` is an integer and `w > 1`. After executing the code, `M` will now contain the original integer `w` followed by the integer `i`.

The other variables `q`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integers `w` and `i`, where `w` is an integer and `w > 1`, and `i` is an integer. The first element of the first tuple in `q` (which is `n`) is divisible by `i`. Additionally, `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
