Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integers `w` and `i`, where `w` is an integer and `w > 1`, and `i` is an integer. The first element of the first tuple in `q` (which is `n`) is divisible by `i`. Additionally, if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` contains `i`. The current value of `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
