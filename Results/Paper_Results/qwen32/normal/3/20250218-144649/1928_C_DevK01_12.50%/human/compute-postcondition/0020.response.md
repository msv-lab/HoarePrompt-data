The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range function's parameters. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the condition in the `range` function, which is `range(1, int(w // 1))`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(w // 1)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to the next integer, and `w` should be such that `int(w // 1)` is greater than the new value of `i`.

Let's break it down step by step:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < int(w // 1)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the incremented value.
- `w` must be such that `int(w // 1)` is greater than this new value of `i`.

Given that `w // 1` is essentially `w` (assuming `w` is an integer), `w` should be greater than the new value of `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` for any tuple `(n, x)` in `q`, then `M` also contains the new value of `n // i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged. `i` is now incremented to the next integer, and `w` must be greater than this new value of `i`.**

To be more specific, if `i` was 3 at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4, and `w` must be greater than 4.

State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x`, such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing the integer `w`. `i` is 4, and `w` must be greater than 4.**
