Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the number of valid k values for each test case based on the problem description. The function `func_1` and the logic used to calculate `L1` are not directly aligned with the problem's requirements.

Let's analyze the problem and the program step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find how many different values of k fit the given constraints:
     - The sequence of numbers repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
     - The sequence starts with 1, 2, ..., k, then k-1, k-2, ..., 2, and repeats.
     - Given a position `n` and a number `x` Vasya received, we need to determine how many k values can satisfy this arrangement.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The sequence length for a given k is 2k - 2.
   - For a position `n`, the number `x` can appear in multiple cycles of the sequence.
   - We need to check if for a given k, the number `x` can appear at position `n` in the sequence.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program calculates `y = n + x` and checks if it is even. This is not directly related to the problem.
   - The function `func_1` seems to be trying to find divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This is not a direct approach to solving the problem.
   - The program does not correctly handle the logic of checking positions within the repeating sequence.

4. **Counterexample:**
   - Let's consider the test case `n = 10`, `x = 2`:
     - The correct k values are 2, 3, 5, 6.
     - The program might not correctly identify these k values due to the flawed logic in `func_1` and the way `L1` is calculated.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly determine the number of valid k values for all test cases.
   - The logic used in `func_1` and the overall approach to solving the problem are not aligned with the problem description.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
