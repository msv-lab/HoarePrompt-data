The code snippet provided initializes the variable `operations` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `arr` being sorted, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`, `operations` is 0.**
