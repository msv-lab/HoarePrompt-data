The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` adds the value `smallest + 1` to the heap. Since `heap` is already heapified and `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`, adding `smallest + 1` will maintain the heap property.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, `arr` (sorted), `median_index`, `current_median`, and `smallest` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `heap` variable, where `smallest + 1` is added.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` for the current test case, `n` and `arr` are the values from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` must be at least `smallest + 1`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1`, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`. `heap` now includes `smallest + 1`.**
