The only variable in the loop head is `heap[0]` and `current_median`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in `heap`, and `current_median` is the median of the array `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `heap[0]` needs to be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since we can only adjust the states of `heap[0]` and `current_median`, we need to ensure that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`. One way to do this is to adjust `heap[0]` to be less than or equal to `current_median`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from the heap, and `heap` now includes `smallest + 1`, and `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`**
