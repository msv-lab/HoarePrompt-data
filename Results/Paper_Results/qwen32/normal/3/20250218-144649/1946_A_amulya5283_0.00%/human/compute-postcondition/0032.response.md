The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the min-heap `heap` and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. The heap is updated to reflect this removal.

Given the initial state, `heap` is a min-heap of the elements from `arr` starting from `median_index`. After the `heappop` operation, the smallest element from this heap is removed and assigned to `smallest`. This means that `smallest` will hold the smallest value from the sublist of `arr` starting from `median_index`.

The heap `heap` will be updated to no longer include the smallest element that was just popped. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that the `median_index`-th element of the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple is the smallest element in the sublist starting from `median_index`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap of the elements from `arr` starting from `median_index` with the smallest element removed, `operations` is 0, `smallest` is the smallest element from the heap before it was popped.**
