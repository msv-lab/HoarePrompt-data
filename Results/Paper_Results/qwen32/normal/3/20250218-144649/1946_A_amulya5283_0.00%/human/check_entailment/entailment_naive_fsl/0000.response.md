Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect for certain edge cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the case when the array length `n` is 1 correctly. According to the problem statement, the median of an array of length 1 is the element itself. Therefore, increasing the median of an array of length 1 is impossible, and the number of operations required should be 0.

Let's examine the code:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        (n, arr) = test_cases[i]
        arr.sort()
        median_index = n // 2
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        heap = arr[median_index:]
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        operations = 0
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        results.append(operations)
    return results
```

### Issue:
- When `n` is 1, `median_index` is 0, and `heap` will contain the single element of the array.
- The `while` loop will always execute at least once because `heap[0]` (which is the single element) will be equal to `current_median` (which is also the single element).
- As a result, the program will incorrectly return 1 operation for an array of length 1, which is not correct.

### Example:
For the input:
```
1
1
1000000000
```
The expected output is `0` because the median of the array `[1000000000]` is `1000000000` and it cannot be increased.
However, the program will output `1` because it will perform one operation to increase the single element.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the edge case of `n = 1` correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
