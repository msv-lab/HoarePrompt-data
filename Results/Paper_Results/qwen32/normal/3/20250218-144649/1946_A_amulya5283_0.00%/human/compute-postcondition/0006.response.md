Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, and `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is `arr[median_index:]`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `heap` now holds the sublist of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end of `arr`. All other variables retain their initial values.
