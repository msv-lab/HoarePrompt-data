The code snippet provided removes and returns the smallest element from the min-heap `heap`. This affects the value of `smallest` and the state of `heap`. Here's the updated state:

- `smallest` is now assigned the value of the smallest element that was in `heap`.
- `heap` is updated to no longer contain the smallest element that was just popped.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers from the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap of the elements from `arr` starting from `median_index` with the smallest element removed and now includes `smallest + 1` minus the smallest element that was just popped, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before it was popped.**

In simpler terms, `smallest` now holds the value of the smallest element that was removed from `heap`, and `heap` no longer contains that element. All other variables remain unchanged.
