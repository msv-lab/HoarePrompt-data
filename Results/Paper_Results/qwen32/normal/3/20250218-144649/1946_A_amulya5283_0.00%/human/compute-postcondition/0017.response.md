To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `heap[0] <= current_median`. 

### Analysis:
- **`heap[0]`**: This is the smallest element in the heap. 
- **`current_median`**: This is the median of the current array segment, specifically `arr[median_index]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` must be true. Therefore, we need to ensure that the smallest element in the heap (`heap[0]`) is less than or equal to the current median (`current_median`).

### Current State:
- `heap[0]` is the new smallest element in the heap after the smallest element was removed and then the smallest element of the heap was popped, and `heap` now contains an additional element `smallest + 1`.
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.

### Adjustment:
To make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `heap[0] <= current_median` holds true. Since `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap and `current_median` is a fixed value from the array, we need to adjust `heap[0]` to be less than or equal to `current_median`.

### Conclusion:
The only state we can adjust is `heap[0]` to ensure the loop condition is met.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and then the smallest element of the heap is popped, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from the heap, and `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median` and `heap` now contains an additional element `smallest + 1`.**
