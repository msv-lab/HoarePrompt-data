The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` into the heap. This means that the heap now contains an additional element which is `smallest + 1`.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, `operations`, and `smallest` remain unchanged except for `heap`. The heap now includes the new element `smallest + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element (a list of integers) of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with one less element (the smallest element has been popped) and an additional element `smallest + 1`, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from the heap, and `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.**
