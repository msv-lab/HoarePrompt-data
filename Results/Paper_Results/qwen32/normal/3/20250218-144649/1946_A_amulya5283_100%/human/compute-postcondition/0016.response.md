Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input by the user, satisfying 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order where each integer `a_i` is provided by the user input and satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`; `res` is set to 1 if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to `a[i]`, otherwise, `res` remains 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `res` is now `res + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
