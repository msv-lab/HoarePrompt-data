To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

1. **Initial State Breakdown:**
   - `t` is defined as `t - 1`. This suggests `t` is a variable that has been decremented by 1, but the initial value of `t` is not provided.
   - `n` is the integer value of user input. This is the length of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula determines the median index of the list `a`.
     - If `n` is odd, `mdx` will be the index of the middle element.
     - If `n` is even, `mdx` will be the index of the lower middle element.
   - `res` is the count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. This means `res` counts how many elements starting from the median (or lower middle) to the end of the list are equal to the element at the median index.

2. **Steps to Determine `res`:**
   - Since `a` is a sorted list, all elements from `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]` will be consecutive and at the end of the list.
   - The value of `res` depends on how many times the element at `a[mdx]` appears from `mdx` to the end of the list.

3. **Output Description:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the count of elements from the median index to the end of the list that are equal to the element at the median index.

Given the information, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res` without knowing the specific values of `a` and `n`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **res (where res is the count of elements from index mdx to n-1 in the sorted list a that are equal to a[mdx])**
