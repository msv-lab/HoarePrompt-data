Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is `t - 1`: This indicates that `t` is being decremented by 1, but the exact value of `t` before this operation is not provided.
2. `n` is the integer value of the user input.
3. `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the user input.
4. If `n` is 1, no additional changes are made.
5. Otherwise, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
6. `res` is the count of elements from `a[mdx]` to `a[n-1]` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `1` and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Output:
The `print(1)` statement will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
