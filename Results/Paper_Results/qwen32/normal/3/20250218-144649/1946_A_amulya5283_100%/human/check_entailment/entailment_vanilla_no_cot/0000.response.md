Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The current approach only counts the number of elements equal to the current median and does not account for the actual operations needed to increase the median.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:

1. Sort the array.
2. Determine the current median.
3. Increase the median by 1, which means we need to increase elements in such a way that the new median becomes greater than the current median.
4. The optimal strategy is to increment the smallest elements to increase the median as efficiently as possible.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        if n == 1:
            print(1)  # For a single element, we need to increase it by 1 to change the median.
        else:
            mdx = n // 2
            if n % 2 == 0:
                current_median = (a[mdx - 1] + a[mdx]) / 2
            else:
                current_median = a[mdx]
            
            target_median = current_median + 1
            res = 0
            i = 0
            while i < n and a[i] < target_median:
                res += (target_median - a[i])
                i += 1
            print(int(res))

func()
```

This corrected program sorts the array and calculates the current median. It then determines the target median (which is one more than the current median) and calculates the minimum number of operations required to ensure that the new median is at least the target median.
