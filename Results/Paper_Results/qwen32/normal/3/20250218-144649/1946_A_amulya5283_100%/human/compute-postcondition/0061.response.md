Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `mdx + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is `res + 1`. `res` is `res + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
