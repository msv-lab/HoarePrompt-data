The code snippet converts the integer `f` to its binary representation, removes the '0b' prefix, and assigns the result to `l`. Given that `f` is 3, its binary representation is '11', which matches the initial value of `l`. After the operation, `l` will still be '11' because `bin(3)` is '0b11' and `replace('0b', '')` removes the '0b', leaving '11'.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `n` is 5, `m` is 0, `k` is 5, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is "11", `p` is 2, `q` is 2, `f` is 3**
