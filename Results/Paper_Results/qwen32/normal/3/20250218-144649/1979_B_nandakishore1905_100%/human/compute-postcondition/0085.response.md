The given initial state provides the values of several variables, including `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and `f`. The task requires us to determine the output of the `print(f)` statement.

From the initial state, we know:
- `f` is explicitly given a value of 1.

The `print(f)` statement will output the value of the variable `f`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is the value of `f`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
