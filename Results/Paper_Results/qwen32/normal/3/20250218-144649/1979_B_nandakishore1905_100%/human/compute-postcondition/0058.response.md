Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, `k` is `abs(n - m)`. If `k` is a power of 2 or `k` is odd, no additional variables are introduced. If `k` is not a power of 2 and `k` is even, `l` is the binary representation of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k - 2` as a string, `p` is the length of the binary string `l`, `f` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k - 2`, and `q` is 2. If `k` is 5, specifically, `l` is '11', `p` is 2, `f` is 1, and `q` is 2.**
