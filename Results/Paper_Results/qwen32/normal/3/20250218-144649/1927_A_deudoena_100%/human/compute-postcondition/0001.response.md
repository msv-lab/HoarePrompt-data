The code snippet provided assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `m`. This means that `m` will hold the integer value obtained from the input. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, `s`, `ma`, and `mi` have certain values and properties, but these are not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 0; `m` is an input integer.**
