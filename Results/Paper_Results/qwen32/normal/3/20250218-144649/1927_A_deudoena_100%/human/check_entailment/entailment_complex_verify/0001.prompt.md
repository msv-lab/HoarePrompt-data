You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):

    s = input()
    c = d = 0

- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present.

            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a new input string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present; `ma` is 0; `mi` is k if the first 'B' is at position k; `m` is an input integer; `c` is k; `d` is 0; `l` is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present; `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in the original string `s`; `mi` is k if the first 'B' is at position k; `m` is an input integer; `c` is k; `d` is the number of characters processed until the first 'B' is encountered in the reversed string; `l` is an empty list; `j` is 'B'.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' (ma) and the position of the first 'B' (mi) in the string `s`, plus 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the position of the first 'B' in a given string `s`, plus 2. The string `s` consists of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white in order for all cells in a strip to become white. The strip is represented by a string of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters.

### Program Analysis:
The given program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Call**: The function `func_1()` is called `n` times in a loop, but it does not take any parameters. Inside `func_1()`, it reads the input for `m` and `s` again, which means it is responsible for reading the input for each test case.

2. **Logic of Minimum Segment**:
   - The program tries to find the first occurrence of 'B' (`mi`) and the last occurrence of 'B' (`ma`) in the string.
   - It then calculates the minimum segment length as `ma - mi + 2`.

### Issues in the Logic:
- The calculation of `ma - mi + 2` does not correctly determine the minimum segment length that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white. The correct approach should be to consider the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B' because painting this segment will turn all 'B's to 'W's.
- The `+2` in the formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be `ma - mi + 1` to get the length of the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B'.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the logic, the program does not correctly determine the minimum segment length for all test cases.

### Correctness: **False**

To correct the program, the formula should be adjusted to `ma - mi + 1` and the function should be properly structured to handle each test case correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    mi = s.find('B')
    ma = s.rfind('B')
    print(ma - mi + 1)
```

This corrected program should work as expected for all valid inputs.
