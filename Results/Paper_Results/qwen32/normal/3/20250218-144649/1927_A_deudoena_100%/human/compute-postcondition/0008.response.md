The code snippet assigns the value of `c` to `mi`. Given that `c` is initially 1, `mi` will now be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a new input string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 1; `m` is an input integer; `c` is 1; `d` is 0; `l` is an empty list; the current character `j` is 'B'**.
