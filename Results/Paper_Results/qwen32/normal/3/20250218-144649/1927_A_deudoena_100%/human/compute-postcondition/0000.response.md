Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present; ma is 0; mi is 0.**

Explanation: The variables `ma` and `mi` are both initialized to 0. The initial state of `t`, `n`, and `s` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
