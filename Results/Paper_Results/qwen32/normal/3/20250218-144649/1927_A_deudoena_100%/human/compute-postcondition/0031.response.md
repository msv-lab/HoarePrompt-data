Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a new input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present, `ma` is `n - 2`, `mi` is `k` if the first 'B' is at position `k`, `m` is an input integer, `c` is `k`, `d` is 2, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
