The code snippet `s = input()` takes a new input for the variable `s`, overwriting its previous value. The values of `t`, `n`, `ma`, `mi`, and `m` remain unchanged. The new value of `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a new input string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 0; `m` is an input integer.**
