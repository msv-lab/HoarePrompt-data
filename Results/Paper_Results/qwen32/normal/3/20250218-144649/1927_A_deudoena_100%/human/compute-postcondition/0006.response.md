The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of the variable `c` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Since `c` was initially 0, it is now 1. All other conditions and values specified in the initial state are still valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a new input string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 0; `m` is an input integer; `c` is 1; `d` is 0; `l` is an empty list**.
