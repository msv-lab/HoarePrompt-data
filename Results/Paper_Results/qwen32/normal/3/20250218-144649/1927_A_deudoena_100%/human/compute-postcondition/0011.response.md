The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, which is used to iterate over the string `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `j` and how it progresses through the string `s`.

Given:
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present.
- The loop iterates over each character `j` in the string `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` was the current character in the string `s`.
- If `j` was 'B', the loop would have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, but since we are looking at the state for the next iteration, we assume that the loop did not break (otherwise we would not be in the next iteration).

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `j` must be updated to the next character in the string `s`.

Since the loop iterates over each character in `s` one by one, the next value of `j` will be the character immediately following the current character `j` in the string `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a new input string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B' present; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 1 if the current character `j` is 'B', otherwise `mi` remains 0; `m` is an input integer; `c` is 1; `d` is 0; `l` is an empty list; `j` is the next character in the string `s` after the current `j`.**
