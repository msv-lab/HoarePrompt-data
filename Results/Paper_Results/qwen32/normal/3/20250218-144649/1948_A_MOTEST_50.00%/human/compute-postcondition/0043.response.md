To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50)
- `n` is at least 2
- `x` is 0
- `ans` is an empty string

The code snippet:
```python
ans += s[x] * 2
```

Here, `s` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we assume `s` is some string or list that is defined elsewhere in the program. For the purpose of this task, we will consider `s` to be a string (as it's common to use strings in such contexts).

The code takes the character at index `x` from `s` (which is `s[0]` since `x` is 0), duplicates it (`* 2`), and appends it to the string `ans`.

Given that `x` is 0, `ans` will now contain the first character of `s` repeated twice.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is at least 2; `x` is 0; `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is now the first character of the string `s` repeated twice. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.
