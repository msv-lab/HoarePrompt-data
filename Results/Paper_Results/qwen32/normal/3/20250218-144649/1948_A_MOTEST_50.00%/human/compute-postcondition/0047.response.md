The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `x` is 1, so after the operation, `x` becomes 2. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is at least 2; `x` is 2; `ans` is the first character of `s` repeated twice followed by the second character of `s` repeated twice; `j` is 1.**
