The code snippet provided does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. It only executes a system command to clear the console screen (`os.system('cls')`), which does not change the state of any variables in the program.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.**

In natural language: The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The console screen may be cleared, but this does not affect the variables `t` or `n`.
