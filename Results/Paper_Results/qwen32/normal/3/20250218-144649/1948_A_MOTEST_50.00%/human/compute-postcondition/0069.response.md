The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to `n` based on the input provided. The variables `t` and `i` are not affected by this code. Since `i` was incremented by 1 before this code snippet, we need to reflect that in the output state. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, and `n` is an input integer. After the code snippet, `n` takes the value of the new input integer.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is the new input integer; `i` is incremented by 1.**
