The provided code snippet simply reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the values of `t`, `x`, `ans`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50); `n` is an input integer; `x` is set to `n // 2` if `n` is not equal to 1; `ans` is a string based on the conditions given; `j` is `n // 2 - 2` if `n` is odd and not equal to 1; `i` is `i + 1` if `n` is not equal to 1.**
