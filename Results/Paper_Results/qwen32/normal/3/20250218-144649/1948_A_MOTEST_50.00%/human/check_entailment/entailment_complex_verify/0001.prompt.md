You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: - The loop prints `'YES'` or `'NO'` followed by the constructed `ans` string for each of the `t` test cases.
    #- The variables `t`, `s`, and the state of the input remain unchanged.
    #
    #Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it prints `'NO'` if `n` is 1, otherwise it prints `'YES'` followed by a constructed string of length `n` using uppercase letters from the alphabet. The string is formed such that it contains pairs of consecutive letters from 'A' onwards, and if `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Input**: 
   - The first line contains a single integer `t` (number of test cases).
   - Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (number of special characters required).

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, print "NO" if no suitable string exists.
   - Otherwise, print "YES" followed by a string of uppercase Latin letters where there are exactly `n` special characters.

3. **Definition of Special Characters**:
   - A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Logic for Constructing the String**:
   - If `n == 1`, the program prints "NO". This is incorrect because a string with exactly one special character can be constructed (e.g., "AB").
   - If `n % 2 == 0` (even `n`):
     - The program constructs a string by repeating pairs of distinct characters (e.g., "AABBCC").
     - This construction ensures that each pair contributes exactly two special characters, making the total number of special characters even.
   - If `n % 2 != 0` (odd `n`):
     - The program starts with "AAA" and then repeats pairs of distinct characters.
     - This construction ensures that the total number of special characters is odd.

3. **Constructing the String**:
   - The program uses the `string.ascii_uppercase` to get a sequence of uppercase letters.
   - It iteratively appends pairs of distinct characters to the result string.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Case 1: `n == 1`**:
  - The program incorrectly prints "NO". A correct string for `n == 1` is "AB" (or any other pair of distinct characters).
- **Case 2: Even `n`**:
  - The construction of pairs ensures that the number of special characters is exactly `n`. This part is correct.
- **Case 3: Odd `n`**:
  - The construction starting with "AAA" and then pairs ensures that the number of special characters is exactly `n`. This part is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the case when `n == 1` correctly. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
