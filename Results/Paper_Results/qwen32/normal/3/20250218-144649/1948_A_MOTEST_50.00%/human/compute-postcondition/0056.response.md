The code snippet `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Given the initial state, `x` was 1, so after the operation, `x` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer (where 1 <= `t` <= 50), `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 3, `x` is 2, `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1]` * 2, `j` is 0, `i` is `i + 1` if `n` is not equal to 1**.
