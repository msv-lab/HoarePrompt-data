Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet provided:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `n` is an input integer and its current value is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t` and `n`. The values of `t` and `n` do not affect the output of the `print` statement since it is not using these variables in any way.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
