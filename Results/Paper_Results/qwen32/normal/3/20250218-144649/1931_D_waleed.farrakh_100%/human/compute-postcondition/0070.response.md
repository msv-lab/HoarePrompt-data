The code snippet `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. This means that `results` will now contain the final value of `count` from the last tuple in the original `test_cases` list.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `results` contains the final value of `count`, `freq` contains the frequency of all pairs `(a % x, a % y)` encountered, `count` is the total count of pairs `(rx, ry)` found in `freq`, and `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` reflect the values of the last tuple in the original `test_cases` list. The `results` list now includes the final value of `count`.**
