Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples `((n, x, y, arr), ...)`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` must contain `t` elements.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will contain exactly `t` elements, where `t` is the number of test cases specified initially. The loop will have printed each element of the `results` list exactly once, corresponding to each test case. The state of other variables like `test_cases`, `input`, `data`, and `idx` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
