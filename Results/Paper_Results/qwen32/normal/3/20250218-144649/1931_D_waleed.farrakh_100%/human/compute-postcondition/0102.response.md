The code snippet `freq[current_pair] = 1` updates the dictionary `freq` by setting the value for the key `current_pair` to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element; `results` contains the final value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary with `current_pair` mapped to 1; `a` is the next element in `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`**.
