Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element; `results` contains the final value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary with `current_pair` incremented by 1; `a` is the next element in `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `current_pair` in the `freq` dictionary by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
