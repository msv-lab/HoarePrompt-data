The code snippet resets the `freq` dictionary to an empty dictionary. This action does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or `arr`, as they are not modified by the given line of code. Therefore, the `freq` dictionary is now empty, and all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer), `x` (an integer), `y` (an integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers); `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `count` is the sum of the frequencies of the pairs `(rx, ry)` encountered during the iterations; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
