You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a` for each test case. A pair of indices `<i, j>` (where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ n`) is considered beautiful if:
1. `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y`.

### Provided Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(test_cases)`: This function processes the test cases and calculates the number of beautiful pairs for each.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, parses it, and calls `func_1` to get the results, which it then prints.

Let's focus on `func_1` to ensure it correctly identifies beautiful pairs.

#### Key Logic in `func_1`
- For each element `a` in the array, it calculates `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
- It uses a frequency dictionary `freq` to count pairs `(rx, ry)` that have been seen so far.
- It increments the count by the number of times the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen.
- It then updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

### Verification of Logic
1. **Correctness of `rx` Calculation**:
   - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` is equivalent to `-a % x` but ensures the result is non-negative. This is necessary because Python's modulo operation can return negative results.
   - This is used to ensure that `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x` when checking pairs.

2. **Correctness of `ry` Calculation**:
   - `ry = a % y` is used to ensure that `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y` when checking pairs.
   - This is straightforward and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Frequency Dictionary Usage**:
   - The frequency dictionary `freq` keeps track of how many times each pair `(a % x, a % y)` has been seen.
   - This allows the program to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs by checking if the complement pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before.

### Edge Cases Considered
- The program handles arrays of varying lengths and values.
- It considers cases where `x` and `y` are different and equal.
- It handles cases where `a[i]` and `a[j]` are the same or different.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly identify and count all beautiful pairs for each test case. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios that the program fails to handle correctly.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs by using a frequency dictionary to efficiently count pairs that satisfy the given conditions. It handles all required edge cases and aligns with the problem description.
