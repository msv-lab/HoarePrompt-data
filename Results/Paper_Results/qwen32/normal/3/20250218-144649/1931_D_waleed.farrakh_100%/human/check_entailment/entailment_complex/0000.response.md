Reasoning:
The provided program is structured into two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The `func_2` function is responsible for reading the input, parsing it into test cases, and then passing these test cases to `func_1`. The `func_1` function processes each test case to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Input Parsing (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - The first line contains the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the array `arr` of `n` integers.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in the list `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Test Cases (`func_1`)**:
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - For each test case `(n, x, y, arr)` in `test_cases`, it initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` encountered so far.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y`. 
     - If the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before (exists in `freq`), it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
     - It updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the dictionary `freq`.
   - It appends the final count for the current test case to `results`.

3. **Output (`func_2`)**:
   - It prints the results for each test case.

The logic for counting beautiful pairs is correct. The key insight is that for a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful, `a_i + a_j` must be divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` must be divisible by `y`. This can be translated into conditions on the remainders of `a_i` and `a_j` when divided by `x` and `y`, which are checked using the dictionary `freq`.

The program handles the input and output as specified, and it efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs using a dictionary to keep track of the necessary remainders.

Therefore, the program is correct.
