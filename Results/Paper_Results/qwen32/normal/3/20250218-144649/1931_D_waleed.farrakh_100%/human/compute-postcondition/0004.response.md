The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `idx`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list; `input` is a string containing the entire input; `data` is a list of strings, each representing a line from the `input`; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of `data[0]`; `idx` is 1.**
