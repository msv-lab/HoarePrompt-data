Postcondition: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` has at least one element; `results` contains the final value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not include the key `(rx, ry)`; `count` is `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` remains 0; `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `arr[0] % y`.**
