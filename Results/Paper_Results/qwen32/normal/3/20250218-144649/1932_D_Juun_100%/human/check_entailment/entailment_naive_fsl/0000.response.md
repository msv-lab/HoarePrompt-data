Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all edge cases and scenarios as described in the problem statement. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Handling of Non-Trumps:**
   - The program only pairs non-trump cards if they have the same suit. If a non-trump card is played and there is no card of the same suit available to beat it, the program does not handle this scenario correctly.
   - For example, if the non-trump cards are `3C` and `4D`, and there are no other cards of suit 'C' or 'D' to beat them, the program should output "IMPOSSIBLE" but it does not.

2. **Trump Card Pairing:**
   - The program pairs trump cards in descending order, but it does not account for the possibility that there might be leftover trump cards that cannot be paired.
   - For example, if there are an odd number of trump cards, the program should output "IMPOSSIBLE" but it does not.

3. **Order of Pairing:**
   - The program does not ensure that the pairs are formed in a way that respects the rules of the game. For instance, a non-trump card should be paired with a higher-ranked non-trump card of the same suit, or with a trump card if no higher-ranked non-trump card is available.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the following test case:

```
1
3
S
3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S
```

The program might output:

```
3C 4C
6D 9S
3S 7S
```

However, it should output "IMPOSSIBLE" because `3C` and `4C` cannot be paired with any higher-ranked non-trump card of the same suit, and there are no trump cards to beat them.
