You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Two players are playing an online card game. The game is played using a
32-card deck. Each card has a suit and a rank. There are four suits: clubs,
diamonds, hearts, and spades. We will encode them with characters 'C', 'D',
'H', and 'S', respectively. And there are 8 ranks, in increasing order: '2',
'3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'.

Each card is denoted by two letters: its rank and its suit. For example, the 8
of Hearts is denoted as 8H.

At the beginning of the game, one suit is chosen as the trump suit.

In each round, players make moves like this: the first player places one of
his cards on the table, and the second player must beat this card with one of
their cards. After that, both cards are moved to the discard pile.

A card can beat another card if both cards have the same suit and the first
card has a higher rank than the second. For example, 8S can beat 4S.
Additionally, a trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of the rank
of the cards, for example, if the trump suit is clubs ('C'), then 3C can beat
9D. Note that trump cards can be beaten only by the trump cards of higher
rank.

There were n rounds played in the game, so the discard pile now contains 2n
cards. You want to reconstruct the rounds played in the game, but the cards in
the discard pile are shuffled. Find any possible sequence of n rounds that
might have been played in the game.

Input

The first line contains integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test
cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of a test case contains the integer number n (1\le n\le 16 ).

The second line of a test case contains one character, the trump suit. It is
one of "CDHS".

The third line of a test case contains the description of 2n cards. Each card
is described by a two-character string, the first character is the rank of the
card, which is one of "23456789", and the second one is the suit of the card,
which is one of "CDHS". All cards are different.

Output

For each test case print the answer to it:

  * Print n lines. In each line, print the description of two cards, in the same format as in the input: the first card that was played by the first player, and then the card that was used by the second player to beat it.
  * If there is no solution, print a single line "IMPOSSIBLE".

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a number of rounds, a trump suit, and a list of cards. It determines pairs of cards to be played according to the rules involving the trump suit and prints these pairs. The function does not return any value and outputs the results directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all edge cases and scenarios as described in the problem statement. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Handling of Non-Trumps:**
   - The program only pairs non-trump cards if they have the same suit. If a non-trump card is played and there is no card of the same suit available to beat it, the program does not handle this scenario correctly.
   - For example, if the non-trump cards are `3C` and `4D`, and there are no other cards of suit 'C' or 'D' to beat them, the program should output "IMPOSSIBLE" but it does not.

2. **Trump Card Pairing:**
   - The program pairs trump cards in descending order, but it does not account for the possibility that there might be leftover trump cards that cannot be paired.
   - For example, if there are an odd number of trump cards, the program should output "IMPOSSIBLE" but it does not.

3. **Order of Pairing:**
   - The program does not ensure that the pairs are formed in a way that respects the rules of the game. For instance, a non-trump card should be paired with a higher-ranked non-trump card of the same suit, or with a trump card if no higher-ranked non-trump card is available.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the following test case:

```
1
3
S
3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S
```

The program might output:

```
3C 4C
6D 9S
3S 7S
```

However, it should output "IMPOSSIBLE" because `3C` and `4C` cannot be paired with any higher-ranked non-trump card of the same suit, and there are no trump cards to beat them.
