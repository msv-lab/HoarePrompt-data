The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('IMPOSSIBLE')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'IMPOSSIBLE'`. The values of the variables `trumps`, `answers`, `suits`, `suit`, and `rank` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string to be printed is explicitly provided and does not depend on any of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
