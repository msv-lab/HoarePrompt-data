Postcondition: **`trumps` is either `['2', '4', '6', '7']` or `['2', '4', '6']`, `answers` is either `['3C 5C']` or `['3C 5C', '8D 7D']`, `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': '8', 'H': None, 'S': None}`, `suit` is `'D'`, and `rank` is `'8'`. If `trumps` is not an empty list, the program does not return None; otherwise, the program returns None.**
