The code snippet initializes a dictionary `suits` with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', each having the value `None`. This does not affect the variables `trumps`, `trump`, or `answers`, which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list; `trump` holds the value of the second line of input (trump suit); the third line (2n card strings) is still available for reading; `answers` is an empty list; `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}`.**
