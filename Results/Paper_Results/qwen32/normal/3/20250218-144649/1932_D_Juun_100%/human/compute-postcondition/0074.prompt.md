You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), representing the number of rounds. The second line contains a single character representing the trump suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'). The third line contains 2n distinct two-character strings, each representing a card in the format <rank><suit>, where rank is one of '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9' and suit is one of 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: trumps is ['2', '4', '6', '7'], answers is ['3C 5C'], suits is {'C': None, 'D': '8', 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: trumps is ['2', '4', '6'], answers is ['3C 5C', '8D 7'], suits is {'C': None, 'D': '8', 'H': None, 'S': None}
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: `trumps` is `[]`, `answers` is `['3C 5C', '8D 7']`, `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': '8', 'H': None, 'S': None}`.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: `trumps` is `[]`, `answers` is `['3C 5C', '8D 7', 'new_answer']`, `answer` is `'new_answer'`, `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': '8', 'H': None, 'S': None}`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value (returns `None`). The function seems to be designed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of rounds, the trump suit, and a list of cards, but based on the provided output, it does not return any specific result for these cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program returns None

Case_3: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
