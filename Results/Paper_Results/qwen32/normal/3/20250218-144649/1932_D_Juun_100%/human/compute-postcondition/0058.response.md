The code sorts the list `trumps` in descending order. The initial state of `trumps` is `['2', '4', '6']`. After sorting it in reverse order, the new state of `trumps` becomes `['6', '4', '2']`. The other variables (`answers` and `suits`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`trumps` is `['6', '4', '2']`, `answers` is `['3C 5C', '8D 7']`, `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': '8', 'H': None, 'S': None}`**.
