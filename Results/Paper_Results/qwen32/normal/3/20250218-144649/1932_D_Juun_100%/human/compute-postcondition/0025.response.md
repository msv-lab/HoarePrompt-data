The only variable in the loop head is `card`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string split by spaces. Each iteration processes one `card` from the input string.

At the end of the last iteration, `card` was processed, and now we need to adjust the state to reflect the start of the next iteration. This means `card` should be the next card in the input string.

State: **`trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank` if `suit` equals `trump`, otherwise `trumps` is an empty list. If `suit` equals `trump`, `trumps` includes the additional value `rank`. `trump` holds the value of the second line of input (trump suit). `answers` is a list containing one string ' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]) if `suits[suit]` was not `None` and `suit` does not equal `trump`, otherwise `answers` is an empty list. If `suit` does not equal `trump` and `suits[suit]` was `None`, `answers` contains one string `rank + suit`. `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}` except `suits[suit]` which is `rank` if `suits[suit]` was `None` and `suit` does not equal `trump`, otherwise `suits[suit]` remains `None` or is set to `rank` if `suit` does not equal `trump`. `rank` is the rank part of the `card` string and `suit` is the suit part of the `card` string. `card` is the next card in the input string.**
