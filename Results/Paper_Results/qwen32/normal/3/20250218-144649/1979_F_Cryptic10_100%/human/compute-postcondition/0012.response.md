Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v1` (and `v3` if `v2` ≤ 0); `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` > 0, otherwise `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 2)`, and `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` ≤ 0.**
