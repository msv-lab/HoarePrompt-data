Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 5; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`. If `v2` > 0, `v3` is not removed from `vx` and `ops` contains the tuples `[(v1, v2), (v1, v2), (v1, v2)]`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` is removed from `vx` and `ops` contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0), (v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`. If `v2` ≤ 0, `v3` is also the first value returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `0`.**
