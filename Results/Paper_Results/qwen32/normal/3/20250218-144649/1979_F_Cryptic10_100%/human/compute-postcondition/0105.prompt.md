Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input value (inclusive); `ops` is an empty list; `p1` contains the initial two integers from `vx` plus any `v1` values that did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of processing; `p2` contains any `v1` values that matched the last element of `p1` at the time of processing.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input value (inclusive) excluding `v1` and possibly `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, or the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `p1` contains the initial two integers from `vx` plus any `v1` values that did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of processing. `p2` contains any `v1` values that matched the last element of `p1` at the time of processing. `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `vx` has one less element if `v2` is greater than 0, specifically `v1` has been removed. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` has two less elements, specifically `v1` and `v3` have been removed. `ops` includes an additional tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, or two additional elements `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged in both cases. `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `vx` has at least one element with `v1` removed, `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)` and `ops` includes the additional tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
