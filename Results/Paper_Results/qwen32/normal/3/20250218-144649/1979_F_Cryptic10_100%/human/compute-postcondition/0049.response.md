The given code snippet appends two tuples to the `ops` list. The tuples are `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are determined by function calls to `q`, but the specific values are not provided in the initial state. However, we know `v2` is less than or equal to 0, and `v3` is the first element returned by `q(0)`.

The initial state specifies that `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to 3 excluding `v1` and `v3`, `ops` is an empty list, and `p1` and `p2` are defined based on the loop iterations and the values of `v1` and `v2`.

After executing the code snippet, the `ops` list is updated to include the two new tuples. The values of `vx`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` remain unchanged, as they are not directly modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to 3 excluding `v1` and `v3`; `ops` is `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`; `p1` will contain the initial two integers from `vx` plus any additional integers `v1` that were appended to it during the loop iterations where `p1[-1] != v2`; `p2` will contain any integers `v1` that were appended to it during the loop iterations where `p1[-1] == v2`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(1)`, and `v2` is less than or equal to 0; `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` for the first element.**
