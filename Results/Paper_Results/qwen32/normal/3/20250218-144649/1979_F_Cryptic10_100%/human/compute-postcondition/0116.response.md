Functionality: **The function accepts no direct input variables. Instead, it uses an interactive process to gather information about a graph by making up to `n` queries to determine the structure of the graph. Based on the information gathered, the function outputs a Hamiltonian path in the format "! v1 v2 ... vn", where `v1` to `vn` are the vertices of the graph in the order they appear in the Hamiltonian path. The function handles multiple test cases, each with a graph containing between 2 and 100,000 vertices, and the total number of vertices across all test cases does not exceed 100,000.**
