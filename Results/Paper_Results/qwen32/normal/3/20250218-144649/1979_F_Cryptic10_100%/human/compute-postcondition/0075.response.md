To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the conditions provided.

From the description:
- `vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers.
- `ops` is a list of tuples representing operations.
- `p1` starts with the two integers from `vx` and `p2` is initially empty.
- The loop processes `ops` in reverse order.
- For each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops`:
  - If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`.
  - Otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
1. After 1 iteration: Depending on the condition, either `p2` gets a new element or `p1` does.
2. After 2 iterations: If the second tuple's second element matches the last element of `p1` from the first iteration, `p2` gets a new element; otherwise, `p1` does.
3. After 3 iterations: Similarly, the third tuple's second element is compared, and the appropriate list (`p1` or `p2`) is updated.

To generalize, the loop will continue processing each tuple in `ops` until all tuples are exhausted. The final state of `p1` and `p2` will depend on the sequence of tuples in `ops` and the values in `p1` at each step.

Let's assume `vx = {a, b}` and `ops = [(v1_1, v2_1), (v1_2, v2_2), ..., (v1_n, v2_n)]`.

The loop will process these tuples in reverse order, i.e., from `(v1_n, v2_n)` to `(v1_1, v2_1)`. The final state will be determined by the cumulative effect of these operations.

Since the problem does not specify the exact contents of `ops`, we can only describe the final state in a general form. After all iterations, all elements from `ops` will have been processed, and `p1` and `p2` will contain elements based on the conditions described.

Given the pattern observed in the first 3 iterations, the final state can be described as follows:
- `p1` will contain the initial two integers from `vx` plus any `v1` values that did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of processing.
- `p2` will contain any `v1` values that matched the last element of `p1` at the time of processing.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`vx` is a set of exactly 2 integers; `ops` is a list of tuples representing operations; `p1` contains the initial two integers from `vx` plus any `v1` values that did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of processing; `p2` contains any `v1` values that matched the last element of `p1` at the time of processing.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `p1` will have the initial two integers from `vx` and any additional integers that did not match the last element of `p1` during processing, while `p2` will have integers that matched the last element of `p1` during processing.
