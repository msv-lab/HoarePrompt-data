The code snippet provided converts the set `vx` into a list and assigns it to `p1`, while initializing an empty list `p2`. The values of `n` and `ops` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers from the original set of integers from 1 to n; `ops` is a list of tuples recording the operations performed during each iteration of the loop; `p1` is a list containing the two integers from `vx`; `p2` is an empty list.**
