The code snippet `vx.remove(v1)` removes the element `v1` from the set `vx`. Given that `vx` initially contains integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` ≤ 0), after removing `v1`, `vx` will no longer contain `v1`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 5; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1`, `v3` (if `v2` ≤ 0), and `v1` has been removed from `vx`; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(v1, v2), (v1, v2)]` if `v2` > 0, otherwise it contains `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by the function `q` when called with the argument `len(vx) - 2`.**
