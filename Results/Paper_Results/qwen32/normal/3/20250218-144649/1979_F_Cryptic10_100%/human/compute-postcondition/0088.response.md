Postcondition: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input value (inclusive) excluding `v1` and possibly `v3` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, or the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `p1` contains the initial two integers from `vx` plus any `v1` values that did not match the last element of `p1` at the time of processing. `p2` contains any `v1` values that matched the last element of `p1` at the time of processing. `v1` and `v2` are the return values of `q(len(vx) - 2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)`**
