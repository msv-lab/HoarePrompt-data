Output State: **The loop will execute for each test case provided as input. For each test case, `p1` will contain all the vertices of the graph in the order they form a Hamiltonian path, and `p2` will be empty. The final output will be the Hamiltonian path in the format "! v1 v2 ... vn".**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, for each test case, the function will have determined a Hamiltonian path that visits each vertex exactly once. The path will be stored in `p1`, and `p2` will be empty because all vertices will have been appended to `p1` in the correct order. The function will then print the Hamiltonian path in the required format.
