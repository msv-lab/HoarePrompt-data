The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^18. The code overwrites the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` with the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the three integers read from the input.**
