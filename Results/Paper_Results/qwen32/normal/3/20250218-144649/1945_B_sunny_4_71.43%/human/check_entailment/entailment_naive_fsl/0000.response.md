Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is flawed because it simply sums the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period without considering the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

Let's analyze why this is incorrect:

1. **Overlap of Fireworks**: The program does not account for the possibility that fireworks from both installations might be visible at the same time. For instance, if both installations launch fireworks at the same time or close to each other, the number of visible fireworks should reflect this overlap.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation independently by dividing the visibility period `m` by the launch intervals `a` and `b` and then adding 1. This does not account for the visibility duration of each firework, which is `m + 1` minutes. It also does not consider the periodicity and overlap of the fireworks.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of overlapping fireworks. We also need to iterate through the time periods and count the number of fireworks visible at each minute, considering their visibility duration.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        L = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = 0
        
        for i in range(L):
            count = 0
            if i % a <= m:
                count += (m - i % a) // a + 1
            if i % b <= m:
                count += (m - i % b) // b + 1
            if i % a <= m and i % b <= m:
                if i % L <= m:
                    count -= (m - i % L) // L + 1
            
            max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, count)
        
        print(max_fireworks)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time by iterating through each minute within the least common multiple of `a` and `b` and counting the number of fireworks visible at each minute, considering their visibility duration and overlaps.
