Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of an n x n matrix using a specified number of operations (no more than 2n). The goal is to fill the matrix in such a way that the sum of all its elements is maximized, and the operations involve permuting the rows and columns of the matrix.

Let's break down the logic of the code and verify whether it correctly achieves the goal:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the size of the matrix `n` is read.

2. **Calculating the Maximum Sum (`sum`) and the Number of Operations (`r`):**
   - The variable `sum` is initialized to 0.
   - The variable `r` is initialized to 0.
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1)` calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations required.
   - The condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is used to determine the value of `r` and to accumulate the sum.
   - The sum is calculated based on the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` when the condition is true, and `i * n` otherwise.
   - The value of `r` is set to `i` when the condition is true.

3. **Output the Maximum Sum and the Number of Operations:**
   - The maximum sum `sum` and the number of operations `n + r` are printed.

4. **Generating the Operations:**
   - The loop `for j in range(1, n + r + 1)` generates the operations.
   - For `j <= n`, a Type 1 operation is performed on row `j` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - For `j > n`, a Type 2 operation is performed on column `j % n` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

**Issues in the Code:**

- The calculation of `sum` and `r` does not correctly reflect the maximum possible sum of the matrix. The maximum sum for an n x n matrix filled with distinct integers from 1 to n in each row or column can be achieved by filling each row with a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This would result in a sum of `n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`, which is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, repeated `n` times.
- The logic for determining `r` and the sum is incorrect. `r` should be set to `n` because we need to perform operations on all `n` rows and possibly all `n` columns.
- The operations generation part is mostly correct but can be simplified and corrected based on the correct understanding of `r`.

**Corrected Approach:**

- For each test case, the maximum sum is `n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`.
- The number of operations needed is `2 * n` (one for each row and one for each column).
- The operations should involve filling each row and each column with a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly calculate the maximum sum or generate the correct operations.

Correctness: **False**
