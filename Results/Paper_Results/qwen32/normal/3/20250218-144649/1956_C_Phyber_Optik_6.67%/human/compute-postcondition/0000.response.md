Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n × n matrix a filled with zeroes. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.**

In simpler terms, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 500. The conditions for the size of the matrices and the sum of their squares remain unchanged.
