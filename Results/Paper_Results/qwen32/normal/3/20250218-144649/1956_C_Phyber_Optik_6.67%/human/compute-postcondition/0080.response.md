The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range parameters `1`, `n + r + 1`. Since the range is fixed, the only variable that can be adjusted is `j`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `j` is less than `n + r + 1`. To execute one more iteration, `j` must still be less than `n + r + 1`.

Given the conditions:
- `j` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration.
- `j` must be less than `n + r + 1`.

Let's adjust `j` for the next iteration:
- If `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `k + 1`.

Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be `j + 1` from the previous state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`sum` is the sum of the series as described, `n` is at least 2, `r` is the floor of `n/2`, and `j` is `j + 1`, ensuring `j` is less than `n + r + 1`.**
