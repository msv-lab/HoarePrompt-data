The code snippet `sum += i * n` directly modifies the value of `sum` by adding `i * n` to it. The value of `i` is 5, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `sum` is increased by `5 * n`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition that determines the values of `r` and the initial increment to `sum` (`n * (n + 1) // 2` or `4 * n`) does not affect the current operation, as this snippet only modifies `sum` by adding `i * n`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 5; `sum` is increased by `5 * n`.**
