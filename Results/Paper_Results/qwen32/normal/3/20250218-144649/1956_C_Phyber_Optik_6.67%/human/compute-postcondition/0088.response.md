The value of `n` is updated to the integer value obtained from the input. The other variables, `j`, `sum`, and `r`, remain unchanged. Therefore, `j` is still equal to the original value of `n + r`.

Output State: **`j` is `n + r`, `sum` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `r` remains unchanged**.
