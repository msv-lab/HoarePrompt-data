To determine what will be printed by the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `sum` is the sum of a series (though not explicitly used in the print statement).
2. `n` is at least 2.
3. `r` is the floor of `n/2` (though not explicitly used in the print statement).
4. `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `j` is less than `n + r + 1` (though not explicitly used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement uses the unpacking operator `*` to print the elements of the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

- `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
- The `*` operator unpacks this sequence so that each number in the sequence is printed as a separate argument to the `print` function.

### Output:
Given that `n` is at least 2, the range will always start from 1 and go up to `n`. Therefore, the output will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't print the exact numerical values. However, we can describe the output as a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **1 2 ... n (where n is at least 2)**
