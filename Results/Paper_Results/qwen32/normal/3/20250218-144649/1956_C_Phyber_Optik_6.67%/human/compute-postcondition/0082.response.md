Given the initial state, we have the following:

- `sum` is the sum of a series (though not explicitly defined in the snippet, it's not used in the print statement).
- `n` is at least 2.
- `r` is the floor of `n/2` (though `r` is not used in the print statement).
- `j` is `j + 1`, ensuring `j` is less than `n + r + 1` (though `j` is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

This statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), separated by spaces. Since `n` is at least 2, the output will always include at least the numbers 1 and 2.

Let's break down the `range(1, n + 1)`:
- `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).

Since `n` is at least 2, the smallest possible sequence is `[1, 2]`. If `n` is greater than 2, the sequence will include more numbers up to `n`.

For example:
- If `n` is 2, the output will be `1 2`.
- If `n` is 3, the output will be `1 2 3`.
- If `n` is 4, the output will be `1 2 3 4`.

Since `n` is at least 2, the output will always be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.

Output: **1 2 ... n (where n is at least 2)**
