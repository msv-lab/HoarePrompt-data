Output State: **`sum` is a value based on the previous `n`, `r` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input. The value of `sum` is based on the previous value of `n` and remains unchanged until recalculated. The values of `r` and `t` remain unchanged.
