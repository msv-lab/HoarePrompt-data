### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using a limited number of operations. The operations allow us to assign permutations to rows or columns. The maximum possible sum of the matrix is \( n^2 \times \frac{n+1}{2} \), which is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers repeated \( n \) times in each row and column.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using a loop and conditional statements. However, the logic inside the loop (`n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`) does not align with the goal of maximizing the sum.
   - The correct maximum sum for any \( n \) is \( n^2 \times \frac{n+1}{2} \). The program does not compute this correctly.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program prints operations that fill rows and columns with permutations `[1, 2, ..., n]`. However, the logic for determining the number of operations and the specific operations themselves is flawed.
   - The correct approach is to fill each row and column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` using type 1 and type 2 operations, respectively. This ensures that each element in the matrix is filled with the maximum possible value, leading to the maximum sum.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program but do not validate the correctness of the sum calculation or the operations.
- The operations printed by the code do not guarantee an optimal solution. For example, the operations are constructed in a way that does not align with the strategy to maximize the sum.

#### Example Test Case:
- For `n = 1`, the output should be `1 1` and `1 1 1`, which is correct.
- For `n = 2`, the output should be `7 3` with specific operations that maximize the sum to 7. The provided code does not generate the correct operations to achieve this sum.

#### Corrected Program:
The corrected version of the program ensures that the sum is maximized and the operations are within the allowed limit of `2n`.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix using the allowed operations. The sum calculation and the operations printed by the code do not align with the optimal strategy to maximize the sum.

**Final: False**
