Output State: **`sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, otherwise `sum` is `i * n`. `r` is `i`. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to the current value of `i`. The values of `sum`, `n`, `t`, and the incremented `i` remain unchanged.
