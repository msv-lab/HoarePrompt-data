Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state step by step.

Initial State:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is 1
- `r` is 0
- The condition `j <= n` is true, meaning `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Here's the breakdown:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n + 1`.
- Given that `n` is 1, `n + 1` is 2. Therefore, `range(1, 2)` generates a sequence containing only the number 1.
- The `*` operator in the `print` statement unpacks the sequence, so `print(*range(1, n + 1))` is equivalent to `print(1)`.

Thus, the `print` statement will output the number 1.

Output: **1**
