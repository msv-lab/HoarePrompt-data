Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `j` is 2
- `n` is 1
- `r` is 0

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n + 1`.
2. Given that `n` is 1, `n + 1` evaluates to 2.
3. Therefore, `range(1, 2)` generates a sequence containing only the number 1.
4. The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the sequence generated by `range(1, 2)` and prints each element separately.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the number 1.

Output: **1**
