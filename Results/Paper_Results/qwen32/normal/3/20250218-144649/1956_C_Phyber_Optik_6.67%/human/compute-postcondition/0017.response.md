The variable `r` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 5. The values of `t`, `n`, `sum`, and the condition determining `r` and `sum` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 5; `r` is 5; If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is increased by `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is increased by `4 * n`.**
