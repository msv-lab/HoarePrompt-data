To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i`, `n`, and the range `(1, n + 1)`.

Given the for loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 because `range(1, n + 1)` will generate at least one value (specifically, the value 1) if `n` is 1 or greater.

Let's analyze the provided state:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
- `n` is an input integer. This variable is part of the loop head and needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.
- `sum` is 0. This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
- `r` is 0. This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `sum` is 0; `r` is 0**
