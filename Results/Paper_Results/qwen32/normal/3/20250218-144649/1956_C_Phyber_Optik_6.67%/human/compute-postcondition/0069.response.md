The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Here's the breakdown of the components:

- `n` is at least 2, as specified in the initial state.
- `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
- The `*` operator in the `print` statement unpacks the sequence generated by `range` and prints each number separated by a space.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can describe the output in terms of `n`. The sequence will always start at 1 and end at `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is at least 2)**
