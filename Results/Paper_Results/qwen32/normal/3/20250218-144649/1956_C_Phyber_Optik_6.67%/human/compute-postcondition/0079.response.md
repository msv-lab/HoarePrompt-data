Postcondition: **`sum` is the sum of the series as described, `n` is at least 2, `r` is the floor of `n/2`, and `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, ensuring `j` is less than `n + r + 1`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the conditions remain as described. Otherwise, the conditions also remain as described.**

This postcondition captures the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, ensuring that the conditions on `sum`, `n`, `r`, and `j` are maintained regardless of whether the if or else part is executed.
