Postcondition: **`j` is `n + r`, `sum` is either `3 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was greater than `i * n` initially, or `(2 * (n * (n + 1) // 2)) + i * n` or `(i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2) + i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was less than or equal to `i * n` initially, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `i + 1` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` was greater than `i * n` initially, or `r` is `i` or either `i` or `0` depending on the condition, `i` is `i + 1`.**
