The variable `r` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum` is 0, `r` is `i`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is greater than 0, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.

Output State: **`sum` is 0, `r` is `i`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is greater than 0, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**
