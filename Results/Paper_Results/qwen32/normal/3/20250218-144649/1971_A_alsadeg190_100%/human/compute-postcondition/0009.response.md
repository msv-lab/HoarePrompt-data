The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state of `x` and `y` is not relevant because they are being reassigned by the input values. The other variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers provided in the input, while `t` and `i` retain their initial values.
