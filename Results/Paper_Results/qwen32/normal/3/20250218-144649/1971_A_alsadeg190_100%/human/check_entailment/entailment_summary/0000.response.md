Reasoning:
The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `x` and `y`. It correctly compares the two integers and prints them in ascending order, which is the expected behavior as per the problem description. The logic used to determine the minimum and maximum of the two numbers is accurate and the program handles the input and output as required.

For each test case, the program performs the following:
1. Reads two integers `x` and `y`.
2. Checks if `x` is less than `y`.
3. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
4. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

This logic ensures that the output will always be the two numbers in ascending order, which matches the expected output format.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
