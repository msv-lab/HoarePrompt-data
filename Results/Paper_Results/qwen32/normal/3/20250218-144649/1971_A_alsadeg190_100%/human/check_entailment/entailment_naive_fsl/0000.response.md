Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads two integers, `x` and `y`. It then prints the minimum and maximum of the two integers in the correct order. The logic used in the program is straightforward and correct for the given problem description. The program handles all potential cases within the given constraints (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9). There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
