The code snippet `x = int(input())` will read an integer from the input and assign it to the variable `x`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two space-separated integers `x` and `y` each ranging from 0 to 9. However, the provided code snippet only reads one integer and assigns it to `x`, which means it will override the initial value of `x` for the first test case. The values of `t` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the input integer, and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9.**
