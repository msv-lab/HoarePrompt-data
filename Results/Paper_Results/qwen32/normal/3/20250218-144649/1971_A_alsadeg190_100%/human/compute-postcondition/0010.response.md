Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `x` is the first integer from the input.
   - `y` is the second integer from the input.
   - `i` is `i + 1`, but `i` is not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(x, y)`

From the initial state, we know that `x` and `y` are integers that come from the input. The exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, but we can describe the output based on the given information.

The print statement will output the values of `x` and `y` as they are, separated by a space.

Therefore, the output will be the values of `x` and `y` as provided in the input.

Output: **x, y (where x and y are the first and second integers from the input, respectively)**
