Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is designed to handle the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and whether it meets the requirements:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `x` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that iterates `x` times, where in each iteration, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
3. Inside the loop, the program checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
4. If `x` is not less than `y` (i.e., `x` is greater than or equal to `y`), the program prints `y` followed by `x`.
5. This approach ensures that for each test case, the program outputs the minimum of `x` and `y`, followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`.

The program correctly handles the input and output requirements for each test case. It reads the number of test cases, iterates through each test case, and prints the minimum and maximum values in the required format.

Correctness: **True**
