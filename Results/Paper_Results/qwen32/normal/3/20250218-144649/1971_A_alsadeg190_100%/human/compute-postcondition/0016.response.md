To determine the output of the `print(y, x)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables `x` and `y`.

### Analysis of the Initial State:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This variable `t` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
2. **x**: The first integer from the new input.
3. **y**: The second integer from the new input.
4. **i**: The variable `i` is updated to `i + 1`. However, `i` is not used in the print statement, so it also does not affect the output.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is `print(y, x)`, which will print the value of `y` followed by the value of `x`.

### Output:
Based on the given information, the output will be the value of `y` followed by the value of `x`. Since the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can describe them as the first and second integers from the new input respectively.

Output: **y, x (where y is the second integer from the new input and x is the first integer from the new input)**
