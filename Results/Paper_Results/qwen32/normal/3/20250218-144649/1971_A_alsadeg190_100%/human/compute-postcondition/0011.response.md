Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
2. `x` is the first integer from the input.
3. `y` is the second integer from the input.
4. `i` is `i + 1`. However, the variable `i` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(y, x)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement outputs the values of `y` and `x` in that order.
- `y` is the second integer from the input.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.

### Output:
The output will be the second integer from the input followed by the first integer from the input.

### Final Output:
Output: **y, x (where y is the second integer from the input and x is the first integer from the input)**
