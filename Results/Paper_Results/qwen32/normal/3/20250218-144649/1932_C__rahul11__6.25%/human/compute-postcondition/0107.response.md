The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is the loop variable iterating over the list `arr`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element
- `s` is a list of characters read from the new input
- `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `0`
- `ans` is `i * i`
- `c` is `n`
- `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`
- `r` is `n - 1 - (number of characters in s that are not 'L')`
- `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current one

Since the loop iterates over `arr`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `arr` after the current one. If `i` is the current element, the next iteration would naturally take the next element from `arr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `s` is a list of characters read from the new input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `0`, `ans` is `i * i`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 - (number of characters in s that are not 'L')`, `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current one**.

However, to be more explicit about the change, we can say that `i` should be the next element in `arr` after the current `i`. If `i` is currently at index `k`, then in the next iteration, `i` should be at index `k+1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `s` is a list of characters read from the new input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `0`, `ans` is `i * i`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 - (number of characters in s that are not 'L')`, `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current one, which means `i` is `arr[k+1]` where `k` is the current index of `i` in `arr`**.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified and we are only concerned with the fact that it should be the next element in `arr`, we can simply state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `s` is a list of characters read from the new input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `0`, `ans` is `i * i`, `c` is `n`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 - (number of characters in s that are not 'L')`, `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current one**.
