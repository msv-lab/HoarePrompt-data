Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are zeros; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their original values except for `r`, which is now equal to `n - 1`.
