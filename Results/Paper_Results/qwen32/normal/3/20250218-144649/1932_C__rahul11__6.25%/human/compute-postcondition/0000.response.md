The provided code snippet only initializes a constant variable `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 6`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`) are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4; the array `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^4; the string `s` consists of `n` characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'; the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5; `MOD` is 1000000006.**
