You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: For each test case, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the value of `ans % m % MOD` after each division, `ans` is the final value of the product of all elements in `arr` divided by the appropriate elements in `arr` as specified by `s`, modulo `MOD`, `c` is `n`, `l` and `r` are final values depending on the sequence of 'L's and non-'L's in `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of values based on the product of an array of integers, divided by elements specified by a sequence of 'L' and 'R' characters, and returns these values modulo a given number.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it is correct based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task involves processing a sequence of commands ('L' or 'R') on an array, where each command removes an element from either the left or right side of the array. After each command, the program must output the remainder of the product of the remaining elements when divided by `m`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array), `m` (the modulus), the array `arr`, and the string `s` of commands.
   - It initializes an array `res` to store the results and a variable `ans` to store the product of the array elements.

2. **Initial Product Calculation**:
   - It calculates the product of all elements in the array `arr` and stores it in `ans`.
   - It then computes the remainder of `ans` modulo `m` and stores it in `res[0]`.

3. **Processing Commands**:
   - Two pointers, `l` and `r`, are used to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array.
   - For each command in the string `s` (except the last one), the program:
     - Checks if the command is 'L' or 'R'.
     - If 'L', it divides `ans` by `arr[l]`, updates `l`, and computes the remainder of the new `ans` modulo `m`.
     - If 'R', it divides `ans` by `arr[r]`, updates `r`, and computes the remainder of the new `ans` modulo `m`.
     - It stores the computed remainder in `res`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the results stored in `res` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program
- **Division Modulo**: The program attempts to divide `ans` by the element being removed and then take the modulo `MOD`. This approach is incorrect because division modulo is not straightforward and can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, division in modular arithmetic requires the multiplicative inverse, which is not handled here.
- **Final Output**: The program outputs the results correctly based on the logic it uses, but the logic itself is flawed due to the incorrect handling of division in modular arithmetic.

### Correctness
Given the above issues, the program is not correct. The division operation in modular arithmetic is not handled properly, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
