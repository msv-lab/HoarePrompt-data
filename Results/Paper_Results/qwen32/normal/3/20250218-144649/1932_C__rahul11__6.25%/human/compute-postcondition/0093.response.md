Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be at least 2; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the input; `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, the second element updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and the element at index `c` updated to `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD` and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `(previous_ans // arr[r]) % MOD` and `r` is decremented by 1. `c` is incremented by 1 in both cases.**
