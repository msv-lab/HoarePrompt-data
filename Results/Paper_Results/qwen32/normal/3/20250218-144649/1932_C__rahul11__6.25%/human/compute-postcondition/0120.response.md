Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the new input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are `0`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[r]` modulo `MOD`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `s[k]` is not equal to 'L'**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[r]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
