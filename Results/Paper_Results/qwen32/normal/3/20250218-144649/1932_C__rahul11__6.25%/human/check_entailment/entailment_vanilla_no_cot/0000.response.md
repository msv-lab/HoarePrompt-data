Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a critical flaw in the way it calculates the product of the array elements after removing an element. Specifically, the program uses integer division (`//`) to remove an element's contribution from the product, which is incorrect. Integer division does not correctly undo the multiplication effect of an element on the product, especially when the product is not exactly divisible by the element being removed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[l], m - 2, m)) % m  # Use modular multiplicative inverse
                res[k + 1] = ans
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[r], m - 2, m)) % m  # Use modular multiplicative inverse
                res[k + 1] = ans
                r -= 1
        print(*res)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version, the program uses the modular multiplicative inverse to correctly remove an element's contribution from the product. The modular multiplicative inverse of `arr[i]` modulo `m` is computed using `pow(arr[i], m - 2, m)`, which is valid when `m` is a prime number. Since `m` is guaranteed to be at most `10^4` in the problem statement, this approach works correctly within the problem's constraints.
