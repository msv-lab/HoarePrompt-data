t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4. The array a contains n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^4. The string s consists of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
