Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is a list of characters read from the new input; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the third element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are `0`; `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`; `c` is 2; `l` is either 1 or 0; `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `k` is `k + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of the third element in the `res` list (i.e., `res[2]`) has been updated to `ans % m % MOD`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
