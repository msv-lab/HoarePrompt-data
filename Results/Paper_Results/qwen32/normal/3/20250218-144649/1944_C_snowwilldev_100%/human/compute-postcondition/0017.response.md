Postcondition: **N must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `cnt` contains the frequency of each element in the array `a`. The frequency of the element at index `i` in `cnt` is not 0, and `t` is either 0 or 1. Specifically, if the frequency of the element at index `i` in `cnt` is 1, then `t` is 1; otherwise, `t` is 0. Additionally, `t` is less than 2.**
