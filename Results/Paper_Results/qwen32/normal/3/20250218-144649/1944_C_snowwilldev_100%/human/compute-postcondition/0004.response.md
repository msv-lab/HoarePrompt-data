The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` of the array `a` in the dictionary `cnt`. Given that `i` is 0, the element `a[0]` will have its count incremented by 1 in the dictionary `cnt`.

Therefore, the value of `cnt[a[0]]` is increased by 1. The value of `N` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1**.
