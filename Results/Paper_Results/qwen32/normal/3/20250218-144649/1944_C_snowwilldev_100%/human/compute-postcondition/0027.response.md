Postcondition: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 2, `cnt` contains the frequency of each element in the array `a`, and `t` is 2 if the frequency of the element at index `i` in `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 1. The program returns 2 if `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or if the frequency of the element at index `i` in `cnt` is 0.**
