Output State: **N is an input integer, the input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `N` is assigned the value of the first integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The other details about the test cases and their structure remain unchanged.
