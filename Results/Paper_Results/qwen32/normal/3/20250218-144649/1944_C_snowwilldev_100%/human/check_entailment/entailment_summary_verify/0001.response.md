### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if it correctly calculates the MEX under optimal play by Alice and Bob.

#### Problem Summary
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from an array `a` and manipulating an array `c`.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Key Observations
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array.
- Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning they make the best possible moves to achieve their goals.
- The MEX can be influenced by the order in which elements are picked and the choices made by both players.

#### Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to determine the MEX based on the frequency of elements in the array. Here is the code again for reference:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
```

#### Explanation of the Code
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `tc` is read.
   - For each test case, the function `func_1` is called.
   
2. **Counting Elements**:
   - The array `a` is read.
   - A dictionary `cnt` is used to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   
3. **Calculating MEX**:
   - The variable `t` is initialized to 0.
   - The code iterates over the range from 0 to `N` (inclusive).
   - For each integer `i`, if `cnt[i] == 1`, it increments `t`.
   - If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the function returns `i`.

#### Correctness of the Code
The logic in the code is flawed for the following reasons:
- The condition `if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0` does not correctly determine the MEX. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array, which is not accurately determined by this logic.
- The code does not account for the optimal play strategy of Alice and Bob. It simply counts occurrences and checks conditions, which is not sufficient to determine the MEX under optimal play.
- The MEX should be determined by finding the smallest integer that is not present in the array `c` after all elements have been picked optimally by both players.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly determine the MEX under optimal play:
- Alice and Bob will strategically pick elements to maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively.
- The MEX can be determined by simulating the optimal moves of both players, but the provided code does not simulate these moves.
- A correct approach would involve a more detailed simulation of the game, considering the optimal choices of both players.

#### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly determine the MEX under optimal play by Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
