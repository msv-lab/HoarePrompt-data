Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and manipulating an array `c`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c` while Bob wants to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Key Observations

1. **Turns and Moves**:
   - Alice starts and picks an element, appends it to `c`, and removes it from `a`.
   - Bob picks an element and removes it from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice will try to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX of `c`.

3. **MEX and Strategy**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array.
   - For Alice to maximize the MEX, she should aim to include as many lower numbers as possible in `c` while ensuring the MEX is as large as possible.
   - Bob will try to prevent this by strategically removing elements that Alice might have chosen.

### Code Analysis

Let's break down the provided code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
```

#### Explanation of the Code

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `tc` is read.
   - For each test case, the function `func_1` is called.

2. **Counting Elements**:
   - The array `a` is read.
   - A dictionary `cnt` is used to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.

3. **Calculating MEX**:
   - The variable `t` is initialized to 0.
   - The code iterates over the range from 0 to `N` (inclusive).
   - For each integer `i`, if `cnt[i] == 1`, it increments `t`.
   - If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the function returns `i`.

#### Correctness of the Code

The code attempts to determine the MEX by counting the occurrences of each element and checking when the conditions for the MEX are met. However, the logic for determining the MEX is flawed:

- The condition `if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0` is not correctly capturing the MEX. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array, which is not accurately determined by this logic.
- The code does not account for the optimal play strategy of Alice and Bob. It simply counts occurrences and checks conditions, which is not sufficient to determine the MEX under optimal play.

### Conclusion

The provided code does not correctly determine the MEX under optimal play by Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
