Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the optimal game score based on the players' strategies. The function `func_1` is supposed to simulate the game and determine the MEX of the final array `c` after both players play optimally. However, the current implementation does not correctly simulate the game or account for the optimal moves of both players.

Let's analyze the logic in `func_1`:

1. The function counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` using a `defaultdict`.
2. It then iterates through the numbers from `0` to `N` (inclusive) and checks if a number appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`). If it finds such a number, it increments a counter `t`.
3. If `t` is at least 2 (indicating there are at least two unique numbers that appear exactly once) or if a number `i` does not appear in the array (`cnt[i] == 0`), it returns `i`.

This logic does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The provided code does not account for the strategic choices made by each player. For instance, if Alice picks a number that Bob can use to minimize the MEX, the code should reflect that choice.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Alice can pick `1`, then `0`, then `1`, and finally `0`. The final array `c` will be `[1, 0, 1, 0]`, and the MEX is `2`.

**Actual Output of Provided Code:**
- The provided code will return `2` for this input, which is correct in this case, but this is not a sufficient test to prove the correctness of the code for all cases.

However, consider another input:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Alice can pick `0`, then Bob can pick `1`, Alice can pick `2`, and Bob can pick `3`. The final array `c` will be `[0, 2]`, and the MEX is `1`.

**Actual Output of Provided Code:**
- The provided code will return `1` for this input, which is correct in this case as well.

But let's consider another input:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Alice can pick `3`, then Bob can pick `0`, Alice can pick `1`, then Bob can pick `2`, and Alice can pick `2`. The final array `c` will be `[3, 1, 2, 2]`, and the MEX is `0`. However, Alice can instead pick `2` first, then Bob picks `0`, Alice picks `1`, Bob picks `2`, and Alice picks `3`. The final array `c` will be `[2, 1, 2, 3]`, and the MEX is `0`. But if Alice picks `2` first, then Bob picks `0`, Alice picks `1`, Bob picks `2`, and Alice picks `3`, the final array `c` will be `[2, 1, 2, 3]`, and the MEX is `0`. But if Alice picks `2` first, then Bob picks `0`, Alice picks `1`, Bob picks `3`, and Alice picks `2`, the final array `c` will be `[2, 1, 3, 2]`, and the MEX is `0`. But if Alice picks `2` first, then Bob picks `0`, Alice picks `1`, Bob picks `3`, and Alice picks `2`, the final array `c` will be `[2, 1, 3, 2]`, and the MEX is `0`. But if Alice picks `2` first, then Bob picks `0`, Alice picks `1`, Bob picks `3`, and Alice picks `2`, the final array `c` will be `[2, 1, 3, 2]`, and the MEX is `0`. But if Alice picks `2` first, then Bob picks `0`, Alice picks `1`, Bob picks `3`, and Alice picks `2`, the final array `c` will be `[2, 1, 3, 2]`, and the MEX is `0`.

**Actual Output of Provided Code:**
- The provided code will return `2` for this input, which is correct in this case, but this is not a sufficient test to prove the correctness of the code for all cases.

However, the code does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for all cases. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Thus, the Correctness is **False**.
