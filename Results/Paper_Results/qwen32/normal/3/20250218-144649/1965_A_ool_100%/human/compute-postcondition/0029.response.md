Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, where the first element indicates the number of test cases, and each subsequent test case consists of an integer representing the number of piles followed by the number of stones in each pile. The function returns 'Alice' if a specific condition is met, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. The condition is determined based on the uniqueness and consecutive nature of the stone counts across all test cases.**
