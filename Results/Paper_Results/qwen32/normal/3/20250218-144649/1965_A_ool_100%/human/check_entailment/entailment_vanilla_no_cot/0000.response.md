Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The key to solving this problem is to recognize that it is a variant of the Nim game, specifically the Grundy number (or Nim-sum) approach for games with multiple piles where players can remove the same number of stones from each non-empty pile.

The correct strategy involves calculating the XOR (exclusive or) of all pile sizes. If the XOR result is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy. If the XOR result is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy when both play optimally.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().rstrip())
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    xor_sum = 0
    for a in arr:
        xor_sum ^= a
    if xor_sum != 0:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')
```

This version correctly computes the XOR of all pile sizes and determines the winner based on the result.
