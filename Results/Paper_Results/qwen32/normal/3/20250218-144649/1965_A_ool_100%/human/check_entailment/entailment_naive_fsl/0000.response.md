Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all possible test cases. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly simulate the game rules, particularly the condition under which a player wins or loses.

Here is a specific counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Alice can remove 1 stone from each of the first two piles, leaving the piles as `[0, 0, 2]`.
- Bob is unable to make a move because there are no nonempty piles left with stones, so Alice wins.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
Bob
```

The program incorrectly determines that Bob wins in this scenario. The core issue lies in the logic used to determine the winner, particularly the incorrect handling of the smallest pile and the differences between consecutive pile sizes.

The program incorrectly assumes that if the smallest pile is not 1, Alice wins, and if the differences between consecutive piles are all 1, the winner alternates between Alice and Bob based on the number of piles. This is not a correct strategy for determining the winner in this game.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and the Correctness is False.
