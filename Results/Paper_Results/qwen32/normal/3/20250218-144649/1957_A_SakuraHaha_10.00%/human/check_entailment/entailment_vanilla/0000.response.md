Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from a given set of sticks, where each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick, and no stick can be used in more than one polygon.

### Key Points
1. **Regular Polygons**: Regular polygons have all sides of the same length. The smallest regular polygon is a triangle (3 sides), but the problem does not specify a minimum number of sides, so we'll consider the smallest possible regular polygon, which is a square (4 sides), as the minimum practical polygon to form with sticks.
2. **Stick Usage**: Each stick can be used in exactly one polygon.
3. **Counting Sticks**: To form a square (the smallest regular polygon), we need 4 sticks of the same length. Therefore, for a given stick length, the maximum number of squares that can be formed is the integer division of the count of sticks of that length by 4.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths.
3. It counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary `cnt`.
4. For each unique stick length, it calculates how many squares can be formed by performing integer division of the count by 4 (`x // 4`).
5. It sums these values to get the total number of squares that can be formed.
6. It prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of squares (regular polygons with the minimum number of sides) that can be formed from the given sticks. The logic is sound as it counts the occurrences of each stick length and determines how many complete squares can be formed from these counts.

### Final Answer
Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

Correctness: **True**
