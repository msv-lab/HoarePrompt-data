Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) and `n` must equal the length of `a`, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks (with `n` ≥ 1), `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that length appears in `a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing, the variable `cnt` will be a dictionary that counts the occurrences of each stick length in the list `a`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
