To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's break down the loop and its behavior.

The loop is defined as follows:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    y = x // 2
    print(y)
```
Here, `t` is the number of iterations the loop will execute, and for each iteration, an integer `x` is inputted, then `y` is calculated as the integer division of `x` by 2, and `y` is printed.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.

After all `t` iterations:
- The loop variable `i` will have gone through all values from 0 to `t-1`.
- For each of the `t` iterations, an integer `x` is inputted, and `y` is calculated and printed as `x // 2`.

The output state after all the executions of the loop will be that the loop has completed all `t` iterations, and for each iteration, the integer division of the input `x` by 2 has been printed.

So, the output state is:
Output State: **The loop has completed `t` iterations, and for each iteration, the integer division of the input `x` by 2 has been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes, it will have processed `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed the result of dividing the input number `x` by 2 using integer division.
