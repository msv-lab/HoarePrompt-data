`y` is assigned the value of `x` integer divided by 2. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is an input integer, and `y` becomes the integer division result of `x` by 2.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`**.
