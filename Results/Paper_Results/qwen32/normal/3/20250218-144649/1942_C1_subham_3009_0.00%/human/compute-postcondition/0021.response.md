Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is 0. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. If the program is executed as the main module, then `t` is set to 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their values from the last iteration, and `arr` is the list of integers from the last iteration. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables.**
