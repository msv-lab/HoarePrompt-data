The code snippet `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, and assigns these substrings to the list `arr`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this line of code. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers converted from the original substrings, but this detail is irrelevant since the code snippet reassigns `arr` without converting the elements to integers.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list of substrings from the input.**
