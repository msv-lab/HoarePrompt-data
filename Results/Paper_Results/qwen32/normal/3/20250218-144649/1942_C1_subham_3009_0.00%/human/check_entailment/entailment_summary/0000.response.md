### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

**Problem Analysis:**
- We are given a regular polygon with `n` vertices.
- Bessie has chosen `x` vertices.
- We need to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed using these vertices.
- The constraint `y = 0` means we cannot choose any additional vertices beyond the `x` vertices Bessie has already chosen.

**Key Insight:**
- The problem is about forming triangles with the `x` vertices. The maximum number of triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is achieved by forming a triangulation of a convex polygon with `x` vertices.
- For a convex polygon with `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`. This is a well-known result in computational geometry.

**Program Analysis:**
- The program reads `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`. Since `y = 0`, it does not affect the logic.
- It then reads the list of `x` vertices.
- The program outputs `x - 2` for each test case.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed using the `x` vertices. It outputs `x - 2`, which is the correct result based on the problem description and the geometric insight mentioned above.
