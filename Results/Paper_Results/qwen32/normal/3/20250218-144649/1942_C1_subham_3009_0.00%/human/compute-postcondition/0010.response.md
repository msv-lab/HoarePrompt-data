The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts these parts to integers, and assigns them to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial state mentions that `t` is at least 0, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, and `y` is the third input integer. The list `arr` is also mentioned but is not affected by this code snippet.

After executing the code, `n`, `x`, and `y` will be assigned the values from the input, and the other variables (`t` and `arr`) will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers converted from the original substrings.**
