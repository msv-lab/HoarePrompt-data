You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            arr = input().split()
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            print(x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the total number of vertices, an integer `x` representing the number of chosen vertices, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the chosen vertices. For each test case, the function outputs `x - 2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out. The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to determine the number of triangles that can be formed with the given vertices. The current implementation simply returns `x - 2` for each test case, which is not a correct or general solution for the problem.

Let's consider the given example to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

### Example:
Input:
```
3
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
8 8 0
1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
4 2 0
1 3
```

Output:
```
2
6
2
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Test Case (n=8, x=4, y=0, vertices = [1, 6, 2, 5])**:
   - The vertices can form 2 non-intersecting triangles. For example, triangles (1, 2, 5) and (1, 5, 6).
   - The program outputs `4 - 2 = 2`, which is correct for this case.

2. **Second Test Case (n=8, x=8, y=0, vertices = [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8])**:
   - All vertices are chosen, and they can form 6 non-intersecting triangles. For example, triangles (1, 2, 3), (3, 4, 5), (5, 6, 7), (7, 8, 1), (1, 3, 5), and (3, 5, 7).
   - The program outputs `8 - 2 = 6`, which is correct for this case.

3. **Third Test Case (n=4, x=2, y=0, vertices = [1, 3])**:
   - With only two vertices, no triangles can be formed.
   - The program outputs `2 - 2 = 0`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `0` (no triangles can be formed), but the logic used in the program does not ensure this for all cases.

### Counterexample:
Consider a different test case:
```
5 3 0
1 2 4
```
- Here, the vertices 1, 2, and 4 can form 1 non-intersecting triangle (1, 2, 4).
- The program would output `3 - 2 = 1`, which is correct for this case, but it does not guarantee correctness for all possible configurations of vertices.

Given that the program simply returns `x - 2` without considering the actual geometric constraints and configurations of the vertices, it cannot be considered correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
