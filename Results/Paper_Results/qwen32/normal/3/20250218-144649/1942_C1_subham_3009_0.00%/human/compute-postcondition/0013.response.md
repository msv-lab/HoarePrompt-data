The given code snippet is `print(x - 2)`. To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the variable `x`. According to the initial state, `x` is the second input integer. The value of `x` is not explicitly provided in the initial state, but we know it is an integer.

The expression `x - 2` will subtract 2 from the value of `x`. Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `x`.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second input integer)**
