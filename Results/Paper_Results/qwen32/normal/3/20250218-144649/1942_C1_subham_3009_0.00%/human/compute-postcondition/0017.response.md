The code snippet `arr = input().split()` takes an input string from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `arr`. This overwrites the previous value of `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are new input integers.
- `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers and the rest are unchanged.

After executing the code snippet:
- `arr` is now a list of substrings (strings) obtained from the input.

The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n`, `x`, and `y` are the new input integers; `arr` is a list of substrings obtained from the input.**
