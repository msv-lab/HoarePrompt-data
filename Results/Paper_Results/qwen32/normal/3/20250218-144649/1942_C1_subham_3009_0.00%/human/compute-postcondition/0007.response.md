Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1`: This indicates that `t` is being decremented by 1, but the value of `t` before this operation is not provided.
- `n` is the first input integer: This means `n` is a specific integer value provided as input.
- `x` is the second input integer: This means `x` is another specific integer value provided as input.
- `y` is the third input integer: This means `y` is yet another specific integer value provided as input.
- `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers converted from the original substrings: This indicates that `arr` contains at least `x` elements, which are integers derived from some substrings, but the exact values of the elements in `arr` are not provided.

### Print Statement:
```
print(x - 2)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement directly computes and prints the value of `x - 2`.
- Since `x` is the second input integer, the value of `x` is known but not explicitly provided in the problem statement.
- The expression `x - 2` is straightforward and simply subtracts 2 from the value of `x`.

### Output:
The output will be the result of the expression `x - 2`, where `x` is the second input integer.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second input integer)**
