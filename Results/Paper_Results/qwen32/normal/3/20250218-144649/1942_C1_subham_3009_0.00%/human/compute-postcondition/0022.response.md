Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the total number of vertices, an integer `x` representing the number of chosen vertices, and an integer `y` which is always 0. It also receives a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
