The code snippet converts the first `x` elements of the list `arr` from strings to integers. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the remaining elements of `arr` (if any) remain unchanged. The first `x` elements of `arr` are now integers.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers and the rest are unchanged.**
