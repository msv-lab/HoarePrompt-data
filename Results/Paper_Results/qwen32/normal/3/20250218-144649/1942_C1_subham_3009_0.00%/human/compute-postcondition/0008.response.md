The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1 before it is decremented.

Therefore, we need to adjust `t` so that it is at least 1 before the next iteration starts.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers converted from the original substrings**
