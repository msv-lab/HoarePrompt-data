The code snippet provided converts the first `x` elements of the list `arr` from strings to integers. Here's the output state after the code has been executed:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `y` is the third input integer, `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers converted from the original substrings.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `t` remains `t - 1`. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their original input values. The list `arr` now has its first `x` elements converted to integers, while the rest of the elements remain unchanged as substrings.
