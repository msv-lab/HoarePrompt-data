Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake. The program simply outputs `x - 2` for each test case, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

To maximize the number of triangular pieces, you need to consider the arrangement of vertices and the fact that you can only use the vertices that Bessie has already chosen (since `y = 0`). The number of triangles that can be formed with `x` vertices in a polygon is related to the number of ways you can choose 3 vertices out of `x` to form a triangle, but it's not simply `x - 2`. You need to ensure that the triangles do not intersect and that they are valid within the polygon.

The correct approach involves sorting the vertices and then using a greedy algorithm or a combinatorial method to count the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed. The provided program does not implement such a method and thus is incorrect.
