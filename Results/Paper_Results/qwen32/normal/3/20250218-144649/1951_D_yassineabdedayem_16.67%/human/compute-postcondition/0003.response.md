The code snippet reads a line from standard input, splits it into two parts, converts those parts to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state mentions that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, but this condition does not affect the execution of the given code snippet. Therefore, `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the first integer read from input; `k` is the second integer read from input.**
