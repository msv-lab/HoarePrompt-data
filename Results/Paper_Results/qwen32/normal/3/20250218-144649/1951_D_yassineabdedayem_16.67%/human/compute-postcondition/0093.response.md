To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(tab))` statement, we need to understand the state of the `tab` list at the point of execution. Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is a non-negative integer (possibly 0).
- `k` is initialized to 0.
- `rep` is an integer between 0 and 60.
- `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration.
- `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated.

The key variable here is `tab`, which is described as a list that accumulates string representations of some `number` for each completed iteration of a loop. However, the initial state does not specify the loop or how `tab` is populated. Therefore, the only information we have about `tab` is that it is a list that could contain zero or more elements.

Since the exact number of iterations or the values added to `tab` are not specified, we can only say that `len(tab)` will give the number of elements in `tab` at the point of execution.

Output: **len(tab) (where len(tab) is the number of elements in the list `tab`)**
