Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `rep` is 0; `number` is 0; `tab` is `[]`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**

In simpler terms, the values of `Min` and `Max` have been updated based on the calculations provided in the code. `Min` is now the smaller value between `n // k` and `k`, while `Max` is the larger value between `int(n / k)` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
