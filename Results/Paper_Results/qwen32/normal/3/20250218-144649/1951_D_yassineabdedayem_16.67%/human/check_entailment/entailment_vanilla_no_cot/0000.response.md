Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly address the problem requirements. The main issue is that the logic for determining the prices of the stalls and the number of jewels Alice buys at each stall is flawed. The program does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels by the end.

Here are some specific issues with the program:
1. The logic for calculating `Min` and `Max` is incorrect and does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
2. The program does not properly handle the constraints that the number of stalls should be at most 60 and that the prices should be integers between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
3. The program does not ensure that Alice will buy as many jewels as possible at each stall in a greedy manner.
4. The program may not terminate correctly if it cannot find a valid configuration of stalls and prices.

A correct approach would involve setting up stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels in a greedy manner. One possible solution is to use a binary representation approach where each stall's price is a power of 2, allowing Alice to buy a specific number of jewels at each stall until she reaches exactly `k` jewels.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if k > n:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        stalls = []
        remaining_k = k
        remaining_n = n
        
        # Use binary representation to determine the stalls
        for i in range(59, -1, -1):
            if remaining_k == 0:
                break
            if (1 << i) <= remaining_k:
                stalls.append(1 << i)
                remaining_k -= (1 << i)
        
        if remaining_k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(len(stalls))
            print(' '.join(map(str, stalls)))
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected program uses binary representation to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up stalls with prices that are powers of 2. This approach guarantees that the number of stalls is at most 60, and it ensures that Alice buys as many jewels as possible at each stall in a greedy manner.
