The code snippet `n -= Min * Max` will subtract the product of `Min` and `Max` from the current value of `n`. Given the initial conditions, `Min` is 2 and `Max` is 5, so `Min * Max` equals 10. Therefore, `n` will be reduced by 10.

Initial State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is 10; `k` is either 0 or 3; `rep` is 0; `number` is either 2 or 5; `tab` is either `['2']` or `['5']`; `Min` is 2; `Max` is 5. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is 2. Otherwise, `k` is 3 and `number` is 5.

Since `n` is 10 and `Min * Max` is 10, `n` will be reduced to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is 0; `k` is either 0 or 3; `rep` is 0; `number` is either 2 or 5; `tab` is either `['2']` or `['5']`; `Min` is 2; `Max` is 5.**
