The code snippet assigns the value of `Max` to the variable `number`. Given the initial state, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. Since `number` is now explicitly set to `Max`, `tab` will contain the string representation of this new `number`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than `Min * Max + k`; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `Max`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Max`.**
