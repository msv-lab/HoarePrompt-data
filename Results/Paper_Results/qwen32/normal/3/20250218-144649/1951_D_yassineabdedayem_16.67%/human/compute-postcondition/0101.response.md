To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the provided loop and the constraints on the variables:

- The loop iterates over the list `tab`, which contains string representations of numbers.
- The loop prints each element of `tab` followed by a space.
- The loop continues until all elements in `tab` have been printed.

From the given output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute until it has processed all elements in `tab`. Since `tab` is a list of string representations of numbers and the loop iterates over this list, the loop will terminate when all elements in `tab` have been processed.

Given the initial state and the fact that the loop iterates over `tab`, the final output state will be:

- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `k` remains 0.
- `rep` remains an integer between 0 and 60.
- `tab` remains a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration.
- `Min` and `Max` remain the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated.
- The loop will have printed all elements of `tab` separated by spaces.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is a non-negative integer; `k` is 0; `rep` is an integer between 0 and 60; `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration; `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated; all elements of `tab` have been printed separated by spaces.**
