The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to reduce `n` to zero by repeatedly subtracting the product of two numbers, where one number is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and the other is the maximum of `n // k` and `k`. If `n` can be reduced to zero, it outputs "YES" followed by the number of operations performed and the sequence of numbers used in the operations. If `n` cannot be reduced to zero, it outputs "NO".
