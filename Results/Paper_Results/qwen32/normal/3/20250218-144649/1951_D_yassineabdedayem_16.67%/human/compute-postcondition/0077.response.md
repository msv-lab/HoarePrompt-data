The code snippet appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. Given the initial state, the value of `number` is already determined based on the conditions involving `Max`, `k`, and `n`. The list `tab` initially contains the string representation of `number`, and after the execution of the code, it will contain two identical string representations of `number`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than `Min * Max + k`; `k` is an integer greater than 0 and updated to `k - Min` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`, otherwise `k` is an integer less than or equal to 0; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Max` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`, otherwise `number` is `Min`.**
