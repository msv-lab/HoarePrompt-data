Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value read from the input, representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^{18}.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    rep = 0
    number = 0
    tab = []
    while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
        Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
        if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
            number = Min
            k = k - Max
        else:
            number = Max
            k = k - Min
        tab.append(str(number))
        n -= Min * Max
        rep += 1
    if k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(tab))
        for i in tab:
            print(i, end=' ')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than or equal to 1; n is 0; k is either 0 or 3; rep is 1; number is either 2 or 5; tab is either ['2'] or ['5']; Min is 2; Max is 5. If k is 0, the sequence 2 5 2 is executed. Otherwise, the values of t, n, k, rep, number, tab, Min, and Max remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0; `n` is a non-negative integer; `k` is a non-positive integer or 0; `rep` is an integer between 0 and 60; `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration; `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated. If `k` is 0, all elements of `tab` have been printed separated by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - rep` if `k` was 0, otherwise `t` is `t - 1`, and `t` is still greater than 0; `n` is 0; `k` is 0 if it was 0, otherwise `k` is a positive integer; `rep` is the number of iterations the loop ran (up to 60); `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each iteration, with `rep` elements if `k` was 0; `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated; `number` is the last computed value in the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
