Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is the first integer read from the input; `k` is the second integer read from the input; `rep` is 0; `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration; `Min` and `Max` are the last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated; `number` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `number = 0` initializes the variable `number` to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
