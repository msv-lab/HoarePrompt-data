The code snippet appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is such that `n - Min * Max` is greater than 0
- `k` is either `k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, or `k - Min` otherwise
- `rep` is 2
- `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`
- `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`
- `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`
- `number` is `Min` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`

After executing the code `tab.append(str(number))`, the list `tab` will now contain three elements: the original two string representations of `number` and the newly appended string representation of `number`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is such that `n - Min * Max` is greater than 0; `k` is either `k - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, or `k - Min` otherwise; `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing three string representations of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Min` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`**.
