Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is `n + Min * Max`; `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n` (or `k` is 0 if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`); `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing one element `str(number)`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`; `number` is `Max`.**

Explanation: The value of `number` has been updated to `Max`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
