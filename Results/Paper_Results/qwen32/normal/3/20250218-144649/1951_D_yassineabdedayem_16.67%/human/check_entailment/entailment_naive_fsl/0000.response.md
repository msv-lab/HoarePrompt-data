Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
10 10
```
**Expected Output:**
```
YES
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
or any other combination of 10 stalls with prices that sum up to exactly 10 coins to buy 10 jewels.

**Actual Output:**
The program might output something like:
```
NO
```
This is because the logic in the program does not correctly determine the prices for the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The program tries to minimize the number of stalls and the prices in a way that might not always work for all values of `n` and `k`.

Another edge case to consider is when `n` is significantly larger than `k`, and the program might not be able to distribute the coins in a way that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

To ensure correctness, the program should be able to handle all edge cases and provide a valid configuration of stalls and prices for any valid input within the given constraints. The current implementation fails to do so in some cases.

**Example of a Correct Implementation:**
A correct implementation would involve a more systematic approach to setting up the stalls and prices. For example, one could start by setting up stalls with prices that are powers of 2 (as in the third example provided in the problem statement) and adjust as necessary to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Since the program does not handle all cases correctly, the correctness is **False**.
