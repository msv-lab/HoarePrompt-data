The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` (and must still be greater than 0); `n` is a positive integer; `k` is a positive integer and `k <= n` (after being updated to `k - Min`); `rep` is 0; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`; `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`; `number` is `Max`; it is not the case that `Max == k and n * Min <= k`**.
