Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is 0; `rep` is 2; `number` is either 1 or 3; `tab` is either `['2', '1']` or `['2', '3']`; `Min` is 1; `Max` is 3. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is 2 and `number` is 3.**

The value of `rep` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
