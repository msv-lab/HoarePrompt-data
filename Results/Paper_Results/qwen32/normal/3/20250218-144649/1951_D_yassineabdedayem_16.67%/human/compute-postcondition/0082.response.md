Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is such that `n - Min * Max` is greater than 0; `k` is such that `k - Min` is greater than 0 if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min > k`; `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Min`**

In this output state, the value of `number` has been updated to `Min`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
