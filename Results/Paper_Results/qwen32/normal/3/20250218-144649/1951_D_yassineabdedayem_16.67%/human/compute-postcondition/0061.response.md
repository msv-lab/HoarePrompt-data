Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `rep` is 0; `number` is `Min`; `tab` is `[]`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In simpler terms, after the code executes, `number` is set to `Min`, while all other variables retain their initial values and relationships.
