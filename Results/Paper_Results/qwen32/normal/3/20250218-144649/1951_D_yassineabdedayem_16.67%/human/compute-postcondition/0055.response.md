Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input; `rep` is 0; `number` is either 2 or 5; `tab` is either ['2'] or ['5']; `Min` is 2; `Max` is 5. If k is 0, the sequence 2 5 2 is executed. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms: The value of `rep` has been changed to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
