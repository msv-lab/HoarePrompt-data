To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: Greater than 0.
2. **`n`**: A non-negative integer.
3. **`k`**: Initialized to 0.
4. **`rep`**: An integer between 0 and 60.
5. **`tab`**: A list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration. It must have at least two elements.
6. **`Min` and `Max`**: The last computed values based on the final `n` and `k` before the loop terminated.
7. **`i`**: Assigned the value of `tab[1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Determining the Output:
- The `print` statement will output the value of `i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- From the initial state, `i` is defined as `tab[1]`. This means `i` is the second element of the list `tab`.

Since `tab` is a list of string representations of `number` for each completed iteration and must have at least two elements, `tab[1]` is the string representation of the number from the second iteration.

### Final Output:
Output: **tab[1] (where tab[1] is the string representation of the number from the second iteration)**
