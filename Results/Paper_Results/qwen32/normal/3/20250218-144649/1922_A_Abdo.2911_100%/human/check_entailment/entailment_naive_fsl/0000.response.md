Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The logic for checking the conditions is flawed.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Logic for Matching Conditions**:
   - The code checks if `a[i] == b[i]`. If they are equal, it then checks if `c[i] != a[i]`. This part is correct for ensuring that `c` does not match the template when `a` and `b` match.
   - However, if `a[i] != b[i]`, the code checks if `c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]`. If `c[i]` matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, it continues to the next iteration. This is incorrect because the template `t` can still be constructed such that `t[i]` is an uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and thus `c[i]` should not match `t[i]`.

2. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     3
     acc
     abd
     abc
     ```
   - The expected output is `NO` because there is no template that can make `a` and `b` match while `c` does not match.
   - However, the code will output `YES` because it incorrectly assumes that since `a[2] != b[2]` and `c[2] == b[2]`, the template can be constructed to match `a` and `b` while not matching `c`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each position `i`, the template `t[i]` can be either:
     - The same as `a[i]` (if `a[i] == b[i]`), ensuring `c[i]` is different.
     - An uppercase letter different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` (if `a[i] != b[i]`), ensuring `c[i]` does not match.
   - The code should check if it can construct such a template for all positions `i`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        possible = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] == a[i]:
                    possible = False
                    break
            else:
                if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                    possible = False
                    break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the template can be constructed correctly for all positions `i`.
