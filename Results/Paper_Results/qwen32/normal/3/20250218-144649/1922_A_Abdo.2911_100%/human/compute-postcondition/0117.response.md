Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the loop continues. Otherwise, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `possible` retains its previous value and the loop continues.**
