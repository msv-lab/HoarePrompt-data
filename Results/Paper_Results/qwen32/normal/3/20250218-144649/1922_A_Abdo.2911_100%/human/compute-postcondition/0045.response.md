The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `t` should be such that `_` is still less than `t`.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `_` was `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be `k + 1`. For the loop to continue, `t` must be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`possible` is a boolean. If any of the conditions for setting `possible` to `True` were met during the iterations, `possible` is `True`. Otherwise, `possible` is `False`, `_` is `k + 1`, `t` must be greater than `k + 1`**

However, since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`possible` is a boolean. If any of the conditions for setting `possible` to `True` were met during the iterations, `possible` is `True`. Otherwise, `possible` is `False`, `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`**
