The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state mentions that the variable `possible` is set to `True`, indicating that at least one iteration met the breaking conditions. However, this variable is not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the value of `possible`, the output will simply be the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
