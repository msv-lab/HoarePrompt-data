The code snippet `n = int(input())` will read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`. The variables `possible`, `_`, and `t` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `possible` remains as it was initially, and the conditions related to `_` and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`possible` is a boolean. If any of the conditions for setting `possible` to `True` were met during the iterations, `possible` is `True`. Otherwise, `possible` is `False`, `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is an input integer.**
