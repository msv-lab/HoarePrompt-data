The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, `possible` is `False` if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is greater than 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are stripped input strings, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `_` is incremented and the loop is broken out of. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and `c[i]` equals `a[i]`, the state remains unchanged except for not breaking out of the loop. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `_` is incremented and the loop is broken out of.**
