The code snippet `b = input().strip()` updates the value of `b` by reading a new string input from the user and removing any leading or trailing whitespace. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters (as provided by the new input), `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
