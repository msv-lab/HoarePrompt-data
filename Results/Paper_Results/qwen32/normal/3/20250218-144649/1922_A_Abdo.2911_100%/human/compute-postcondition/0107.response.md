Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, and the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to the element at index `i` in list `b`. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the condition is met as specified. Otherwise, `possible` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
