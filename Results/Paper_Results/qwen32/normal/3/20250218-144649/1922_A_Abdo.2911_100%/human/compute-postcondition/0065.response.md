The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given the conditions provided, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`possible` is `True` if `c[0]` is not equal to `a[0]` and `a[0]` equals `b[0]`. If `a[0]` does not equal `b[0]`, `possible` is `False` if `c[0]` is equal to either `a[0]` or `b[0]`. Otherwise, `possible` is `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, and `i` is 1.**
