Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, `possible` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. If the character at position `i` in `a` is equal to the character at position `i` in `b`, `possible` remains `False`. If the character at position `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at position `i` in `b`, `possible` is set to `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop is broken. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the loop continues. Otherwise, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer value provided by the user input where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the string provided by the user input, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the new input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` remains unchanged and the loop or if statement continues. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]`, `possible` remains unchanged and the loop or if statement continues.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
