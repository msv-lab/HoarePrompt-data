Postcondition: **`possible` is `True` if any iteration meets the condition where `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or if `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, and `t` is greater than the new value of `_`. The current value of `possible` is `True`.**
