The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables `n` and `i` directly in this context. The value of `i` is already given as `i + 1` in the initial state, which suggests that `i` has already been incremented in a previous part of the loop. The `continue` statement will not change this value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
