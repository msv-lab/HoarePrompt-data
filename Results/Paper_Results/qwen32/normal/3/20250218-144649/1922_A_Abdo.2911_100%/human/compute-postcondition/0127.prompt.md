Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is greater than the new value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input value, `b` is the stripped input value, `c` is the stripped input value, `possible` is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then `possible` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `possible` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the loop continues. Otherwise, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks. If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `possible` retains its previous value and the loop continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the value of `possible` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
