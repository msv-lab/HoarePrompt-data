The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `t` is a fixed input integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1**
