Reasoning:

The provided program calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. However, this formula does not correctly solve the problem as described.

The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the first `m` minutes, and adds 2 to it. This does not account for the overlap in visibility periods of fireworks from both installations. The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of overlapping fireworks, and then calculating the maximum number of overlapping fireworks within a period.

For example, in the test case `6 7 4`, the correct answer is `2`, which means that at some point in time, fireworks from both installations are visible simultaneously. The given formula would not yield this result correctly.

Thus, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
