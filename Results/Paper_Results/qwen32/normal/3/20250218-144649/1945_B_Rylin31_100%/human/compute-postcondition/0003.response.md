To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's mentioned as part of the input).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.

### Expression Analysis:
- `m // a`: This is the integer division of `m` by `a`, resulting in the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.
- `m // b`: This is the integer division of `m` by `b`, resulting in the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.
- The expression `m // a + m // b + 2` adds these two results together and then adds 2.

### Output:
The output of the print statement will be the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **m // a + m // b + 2 (where m // a is the integer division of m by a, m // b is the integer division of m by b)**
