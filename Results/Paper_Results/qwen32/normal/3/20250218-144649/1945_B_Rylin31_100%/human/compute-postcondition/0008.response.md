The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. This means that the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be updated based on the new input. The variable `t` and the variable `i` are not affected by this code snippet as they are not involved in the input reading process.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.**
