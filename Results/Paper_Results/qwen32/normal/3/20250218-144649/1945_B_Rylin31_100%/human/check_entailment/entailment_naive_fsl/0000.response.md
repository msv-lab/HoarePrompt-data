Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is incorrect because it simply adds up the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and adds an additional 2, which does not account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods.

Let's analyze the logic in the provided program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the first `m` minutes (`m // a`), the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the first `m` minutes (`m // b`), and then adds 2. The addition of 2 is not justified and does not account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations. The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of the overlapping fireworks and then calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        max_fireworks = (m // a) + (m // b) - (m // lcm_ab)
        if m % a == 0:
            max_fireworks += 1
        if m % b == 0:
            max_fireworks += 1
        print(max_fireworks)

# Example usage
# func()
```

In this corrected version, we calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods. We then adjust the count of fireworks to avoid double-counting the overlapping fireworks. This approach ensures that we correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time.

Since the original program does not correctly handle the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**.
