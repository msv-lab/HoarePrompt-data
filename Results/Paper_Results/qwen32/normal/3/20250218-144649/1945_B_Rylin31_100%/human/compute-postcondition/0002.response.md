The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, while `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers between 1 and 10^18. However, the code snippet overwrites the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` with new input values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the three integers read from the input.**
