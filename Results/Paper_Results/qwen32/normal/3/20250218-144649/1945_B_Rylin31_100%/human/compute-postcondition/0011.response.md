Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `a`, `b`, and `m`. `a` and `b` represent the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and `m` is the time a firework is visible in the sky. The function returns the number of moments in time when fireworks from both installations are visible in the sky for each test case.**
