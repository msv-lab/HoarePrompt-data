You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of moments in time when fireworks from both installations are visible in the sky.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. Given the frequency of fireworks launches `a` and `b` for the two installations, and the visibility duration `m`, we need to calculate the maximum overlap of fireworks in the sky.

### Key Points

1. **Launch Times**: 
   - The first installation launches fireworks at times `a, 2a, 3a, ...`
   - The second installation launches fireworks at times `b, 2b, 3b, ...`
   
2. **Visibility Duration**:
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch, i.e., from launch time `x` to `x + m`.

3. **Overlap Calculation**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that overlap at any given time.

### Provided Program Analysis

The provided program calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`.

#### Breakdown of the Program

- `m // a`: Counts the number of fireworks launched by the first installation that are visible within the first `m` minutes.
- `m // b`: Counts the number of fireworks launched by the second installation that are visible within the first `m` minutes.
- `+ 2`: This part of the formula does not align with the problem's requirements. It seems to be an incorrect assumption or an arbitrary addition.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the overlap of the intervals defined by the launch times and visibility durations. The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of the overlap and then calculating the maximum overlap within one period.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
