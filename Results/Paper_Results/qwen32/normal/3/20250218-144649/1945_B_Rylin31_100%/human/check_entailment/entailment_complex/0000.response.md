Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The current implementation simply sums the integer divisions of `m` by `a` and `m` by `b` and adds 2, which does not account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods or the correct calculation of the simultaneous visibility.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine the number of moments in time when fireworks from both installations are visible. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, and then determining how many fireworks from each installation are visible at the same time within a given period.

The correct approach would involve:
1. Calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. Determining the number of fireworks visible from each installation within the range `[0, m]`.
3. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle to count the number of moments when fireworks from both installations are visible simultaneously.

Given the complexity and the requirement for precise calculations with large numbers, a correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        fireworks_a = m // a + 1
        fireworks_b = m // b + 1
        fireworks_both = m // lcm_ab + 1
        
        max_visible = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - fireworks_both
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This program calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation and subtracts the overlap (fireworks visible from both installations) to get the correct result.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
