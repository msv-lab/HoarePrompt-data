To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `i < len(ar)` remains true. The variables `i` and `len(ar)` are the only ones that matter for the loop condition.

Given:
- `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- `ar` is a list of integers and must have at least `i + 1` elements for the loop to proceed.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, so `i` is now pointing to the next element in the list `ar` that needs to be processed. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `len(ar)`.

Let's break down the conditions:
- If `i` is currently `len(ar) - 1`, then the loop will not execute again because `i < len(ar)` would be false.
- To ensure the loop executes again, `i` must be less than `len(ar) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, we need to adjust `i` and `len(ar)` such that `i < len(ar)` holds true. Specifically, we can ensure that `i` is at most `len(ar) - 2` at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least `i + 2` elements; `i` is incremented by 1 but must be such that `i < len(ar) - 1`; `same` is 3 if `ar[i]` equals `num` and was previously 2, otherwise `same` is 1; `num` is updated to `ar[i]` if `same` is 1, otherwise it remains `ar[2]`; `minn` remains `inf` if `ar[i]` equals `num` and was previously `inf`, otherwise `minn` is 1 if `ar[i-1]` equals `num` or `same` was 1, otherwise `minn` is 2.**

To simplify, the key adjustment is to ensure that `i` is such that `i < len(ar) - 1`:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least `i + 2` elements; `i` must be less than `len(ar) - 1`; `same`, `num`, and `minn` are updated as per the loop logic.**
