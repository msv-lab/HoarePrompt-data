Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's determine the output state:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements
- `minn` is 1
- `i` is 5 if `same` is 3 else `i` is 6
- `same` is 3 if `i` is 5 else `same` is 1
- `num` is `ar[5]` if `same` is 3 else `num` is `ar[6]`

Code Snippet:
```
same = 1
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `same` is explicitly set to 1.

As a result, we need to adjust the values of `i` and `num` based on the new value of `same`:
- Since `same` is now 1, `i` will be 6 (as per the condition `i` is 5 if `same` is 3 else `i` is 6).
- Since `same` is now 1, `num` will be `ar[6]` (as per the condition `num` is `ar[5]` if `same` is 3 else `num` is `ar[6]`).

The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `minn` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 5 elements, `minn` is 1, `i` is 6, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[6]`.**
