The code snippet `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `ar`. This means that `ar` will be updated to the new list of integers provided by the input. The values of `n`, `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are not directly affected by this line of code, but `i` will need to be updated to the new length of `ar`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input; `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last number in `ar` if it is the same as the previous one, otherwise 1; `num` is the last number in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`; `i` is equal to the length of the new `ar`.**
