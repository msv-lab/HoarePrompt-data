The provided code snippet overwrites the existing `ar` list with a new list of integers obtained from the input. Therefore, the previous value of `ar` is discarded. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input; `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive numbers in `ar`; `num` is the last unique number encountered in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`, where `minn` is `inf` if no valid minimum has been found yet; `i` is `len(ar)`**.

In simpler terms, the list `ar` is updated to a new list of integers from the input, while all other variables retain their previous values.
