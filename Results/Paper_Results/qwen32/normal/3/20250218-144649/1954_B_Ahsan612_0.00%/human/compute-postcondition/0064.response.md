The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was initially 3 if `ar[i] == num` and 4 otherwise, after the increment, `i` will be 4 if `ar[i] == num` and 5 otherwise. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and has more than 3 elements; `minn` is 1; `i` is 4 if `ar[i] == num` and 5 otherwise; `same` is 2 if `ar[i] == num` and 1 otherwise; `num` is `ar[2]` if `ar[i] == num` and `ar[4]` otherwise.**
