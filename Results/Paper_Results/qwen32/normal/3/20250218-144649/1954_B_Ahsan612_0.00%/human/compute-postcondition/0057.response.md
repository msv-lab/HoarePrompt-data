To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `len(ar)`. The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`, so we need to ensure that `i` is less than the length of the list `ar`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is the new input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and has at least 2 elements
- `same` is 1
- `num` is `ar[2]`
- `minn` is 1
- `i` is 3

The loop condition `i < len(ar)` must be true for the loop to execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and has more than 3 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is 1; `i` is 3**
