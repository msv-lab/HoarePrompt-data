The code snippet provided increments the variable `same` by 1. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least `i + 2` elements; `i` must be less than `len(ar) - 1`; `same` is increased by 1; `num` and `minn` are updated as per the loop logic.**
