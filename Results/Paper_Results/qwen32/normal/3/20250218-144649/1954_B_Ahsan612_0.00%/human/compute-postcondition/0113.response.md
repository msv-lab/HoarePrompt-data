To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the logic and behavior of the loop. The loop iterates over the list `ar` starting from index `i = 1` and keeps track of consecutive occurrences of the same number in the list. It updates the count of consecutive occurrences (`same`), the minimum count of consecutive occurrences (`minn`), and the current number being tracked (`num`). 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the loop behaves over its entire execution:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `same` is initialized to 1.
   - `num` is initialized to `ar[0]`.
   - `minn` is initialized to `inf`.
   - `i` is initialized to 1.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs while `i < len(ar)`.
   - For each element `ar[i]`:
     - If `ar[i] == num`, it increments `same`.
     - If `ar[i] != num`, it updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to `ar[i]`.
     - Regardless of whether `ar[i]` equals `num`, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Termination:**
   - The loop terminates when `i` reaches the length of `ar`.

After the loop finishes, the final values of `same`, `num`, and `minn` are determined based on the sequence of numbers in `ar`.

### Final Output State:
- `same`: The count of consecutive occurrences of the last number in a sequence of consecutive numbers in `ar`.
- `num`: The last number in the list `ar`.
- `minn`: The minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`.
- `i`: The length of the list `ar` (since the loop increments `i` until it reaches this value).

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example list `ar = [3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1]`:

- Initially, `same = 1`, `num = 3`, `minn = inf`, `i = 1`.
- After 1st iteration (`i = 1`), `ar[1] == 3`, so `same = 2`.
- After 2nd iteration (`i = 2`), `ar[2] == 3`, so `same = 3`.
- After 3rd iteration (`i = 3`), `ar[3] != 3`, so `minn = min(inf, 3) = 3`, `same = 1`, `num = 2`.
- After 4th iteration (`i = 4`), `ar[4] == 2`, so `same = 2`.
- After 5th iteration (`i = 5`), `ar[5] != 2`, so `minn = min(3, 2) = 2`, `same = 1`, `num = 1`.
- After 6th iteration (`i = 6`), the loop terminates.

Thus, the final state is:
- `same = 1`
- `num = 1`
- `minn = 2`
- `i = 6`

Output State: **`same` is 1; `num` is 1; `minn` is 2; `i` is 6.**

This output state represents the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
