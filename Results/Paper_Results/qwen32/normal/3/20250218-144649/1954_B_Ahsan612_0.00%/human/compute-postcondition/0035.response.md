Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers; `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last number in `ar` if it is the same as the previous one, otherwise 1; `num` is the last number in `ar`; `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`; `i` is equal to the length of `ar`. The current value of `minn` is `inf`.**
