The code snippet provided increments the value of `i` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, and `minn`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1 if `ar[i]` equals `num` (i.e., `ar[0]`), otherwise `i` is 2.
- If `ar[i]` equals `num`, `same` is 2; otherwise, `same` is 1 and `num` is updated to `ar[2]`.
- If `ar[i]` equals `num`, `minn` remains `inf`; otherwise, `minn` is updated to 1.

After executing `i += 1`, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least 2 elements; `i` is `i + 1`; `same` is 2 if `ar[i]` equals `num` (i.e., `ar[0]`), otherwise `same` is 1 and `num` is updated to `ar[2]`; `minn` remains `inf` if `ar[i]` equals `num`, otherwise `minn` is updated to 1.**
