The code snippet `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Given that `i` is 2 and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, `num` will now hold the value of `ar[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least 2 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is 2; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`**
