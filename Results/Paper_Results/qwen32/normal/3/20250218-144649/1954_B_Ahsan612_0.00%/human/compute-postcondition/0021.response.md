The code snippet updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `same`. Given the initial state, `minn` is initially 1, and `same` is either 1 or 2. The minimum value between 1 and either 1 or 2 will always be 1. Therefore, `minn` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is 4, `num` is `ar[4]`, `same` is 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`; otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1**
