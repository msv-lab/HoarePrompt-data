The code snippet `minn = inf` directly assigns the value `inf` to the variable `minn`. This means that any previous value of `minn` is overwritten. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is `len(ar)`**.
