Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is the new list of integers provided by the input and must have at least `i + 2` elements; `i` is less than `len(ar) - 1`. If `ar[i] == num`, then `same` is increased by 1 and `num` and `minn` are updated as per the loop logic. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, `same` is set to 1, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and 1, and `num` is set to `ar[i]`.**
