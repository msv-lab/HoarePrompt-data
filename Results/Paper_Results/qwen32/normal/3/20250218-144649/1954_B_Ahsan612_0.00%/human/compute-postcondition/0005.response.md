The code snippet assigns the value `inf` (infinity) to the variable `minn`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is `inf`**.
