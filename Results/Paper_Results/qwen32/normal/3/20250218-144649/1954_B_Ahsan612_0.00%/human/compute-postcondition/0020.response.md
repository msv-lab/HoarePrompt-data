The code snippet `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to be equal to the element at index `i` in the list `ar`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, so `num` will now be equal to `ar[4]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is 4, `num` is `ar[4]`, `same` is 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`; otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1**.
