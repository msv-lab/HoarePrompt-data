The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `i` was 2, so after the increment, `i` becomes 3. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `minn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is a list of integers provided by the input and has at least 2 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is 1; `i` is 3.**
