The code increments the value of `same` by 1. Given that `same` was previously 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, or 1 if they are not equal, after the increment, `same` will be 3 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, or 2 if they were not equal. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 3 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`; otherwise, `same` is 2, `minn` is 1**.
