The code snippet sets `same` to 1, regardless of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is 4, `num` is `ar[4]`, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1**.
