The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so after the increment, `i` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is 3; if `ar[i]` is equal to `num` (which is `ar[0]`), then `same` is 2; otherwise, `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[2]`; `minn` is 1.**
