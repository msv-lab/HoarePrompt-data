The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` is 2. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `same` is 1; `num` is the first number in `ar`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is 2; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`**
