The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if `a` meets or exceeds a certain threshold based on the values of `k` and `x`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The threshold is determined by specific conditions involving `k` and `x`.
