### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether Sasha can guarantee that he can reach any number of coins `n` given the rules of the casino. Let's break down the logic of the provided program:

1. **Initial Conditions and Strategy:**
   - Sasha can place bets and wins bring him `y * k` coins.
   - He can lose up to `x` consecutive times.
   - The strategy revolves around ensuring that Sasha can always place a bet after a certain number of losses, which depends on the value of `k` and `x`.

2. **Logic in the Code:**
   - If `x < k - 1`:
     - Sasha needs at least `x + 1` coins to ensure he can place bets after a sequence of `x` losses.
     - This is because the worst-case scenario is losing `x` times in a row, and he needs `x + 1` coins to make the next bet.
   - If `x == k - 1`:
     - Sasha needs at least `x + 2` coins.
     - This is because losing `x` times in a row means he needs an extra coin to start betting again, and another extra coin to ensure he can place a bet after a win.
   - If `x > k - 1`:
     - The logic here is more complex. It calculates a minimum number of coins `z` required to ensure Sasha can always place bets after a series of losses.
     - It iteratively calculates the potential growth of coins after a series of wins and losses, ensuring that Sasha can always place the next bet.

3. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `k=2, x=1, a=7`
     - `x < k - 1` is false, and `x == k - 1` is true.
     - Sasha needs `x + 2 = 3` coins, and he has `7` coins, so the answer is "YES".
   - **Test Case 2:** `k=2, x=1, a=1`
     - `x < k - 1` is false, and `x == k - 1` is true.
     - Sasha needs `x + 2 = 3` coins, and he has `1` coin, so the answer is "NO".
   - **Test Case 3:** `k=2, x=3, a=15`
     - `x < k - 1` is false, and `x == k - 1` is false.
     - The logic calculates the minimum coins required, and `a=15` is sufficient, so the answer is "YES".
   - **Test Case 4:** `k=3, x=3, a=6`
     - `x < k - 1` is false, and `x == k - 1` is true.
     - Sasha needs `x + 2 = 5` coins, and he has `6` coins, so the answer is "YES".
   - **Test Case 5:** `k=4, x=4, a=5`
     - `x < k - 1` is false, and `x == k - 1` is false.
     - The logic calculates the minimum coins required, and `a=5` is insufficient, so the answer is "NO".
   - **Test Case 6:** `k=5, x=4, a=7`
     - `x < k - 1` is false, and `x == k - 1` is false.
     - The logic calculates the minimum coins required, and `a=7` is sufficient, so the answer is "YES".
   - **Test Case 7:** `k=4, x=88, a=1000000000`
     - `x < k - 1` is false, and `x == k - 1` is false.
     - The logic calculates the minimum coins required, and `a=1000000000` is sufficient, so the answer is "NO".
   - **Test Case 8:** `k=25, x=69, a=231`
     - `x < k - 1` is false, and `x == k - 1` is false.
     - The logic calculates the minimum coins required, and `a=231` is insufficient, so the answer is "NO".
   - **Test Case 9:** `k=13, x=97, a=18806`
     - `x < k - 1` is false, and `x == k - 1` is false.
     - The logic calculates the minimum coins required, and `a=18806` is insufficient, so the answer is "NO".

The logic in the code aligns with the problem's requirements and correctly handles the different cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
