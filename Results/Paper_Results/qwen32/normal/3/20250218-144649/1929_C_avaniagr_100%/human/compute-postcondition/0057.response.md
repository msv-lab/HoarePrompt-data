The `print('NO')` statement in the provided code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string 'NO', regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`. These variables are mentioned in the initial state but are not used in the print statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`. However, none of these variables are referenced in the print statement.
2. The print statement `print('NO')` is hardcoded to output the string 'NO'.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
