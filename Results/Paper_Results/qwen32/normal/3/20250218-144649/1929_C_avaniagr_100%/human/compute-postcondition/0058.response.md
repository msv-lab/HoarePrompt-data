Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting and converting the string `s` from the next line of input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then the if part conditions apply. Otherwise, the else part conditions apply. In both cases, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.**
