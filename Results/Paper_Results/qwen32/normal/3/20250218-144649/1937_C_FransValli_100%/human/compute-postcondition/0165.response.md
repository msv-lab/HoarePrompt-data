The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. This modifies `arr` by adding one more element to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, and `res` remain unchanged by this operation. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 outside the provided code snippet, so we do not account for that change here.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or `0` if no such response was received, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` is modified to include the new element `i`, `res` is the input string.**
