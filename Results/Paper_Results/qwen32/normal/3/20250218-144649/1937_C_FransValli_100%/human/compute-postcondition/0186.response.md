Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received, `mini` is `arr[2]`, `arr` contains at least two elements where the response was `'='`, `item` is `arr[2]`, `res` is the input response.**

In natural language: The value of `mini` has been updated to be equal to `item`, which is `arr[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
