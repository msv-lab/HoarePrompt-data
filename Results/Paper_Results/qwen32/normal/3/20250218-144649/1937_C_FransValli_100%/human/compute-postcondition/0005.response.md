The code snippet `res = input()` assigns the value of the user input to the variable `res`. The initial state of `t`, `n`, and `maxi` remains unchanged. Since the input value is not specified, we can only state that `res` now holds whatever value the user provides.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the value of the user input.**
