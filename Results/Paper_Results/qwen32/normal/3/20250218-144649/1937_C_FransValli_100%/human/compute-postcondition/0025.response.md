The code snippet `arr = [i]` changes the value of `arr` from `[0]` to `[i]`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `res`) remain unchanged. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state or the code snippet, we cannot determine a specific value for `i`. However, the output state will reflect that `arr` now holds the value `[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`, `res` is `'<'`.**
