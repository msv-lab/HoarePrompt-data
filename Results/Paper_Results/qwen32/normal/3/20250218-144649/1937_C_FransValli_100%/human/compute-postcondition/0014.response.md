The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 5. The value of `n` must be greater than 5 for the loop to continue executing.

The other variables (`t`, `res`, `maxi`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 5, `res` is the value of the user input, `maxi` is 4 if `res` is '<', otherwise `maxi` remains 0, and `i` is 5**
