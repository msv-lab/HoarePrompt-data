Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is `i`, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, `res` is the new input string, `i` is the current value of `i` after increment.**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to the current value of `i`. All other variables retain their previous states.
