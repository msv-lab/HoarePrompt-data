The code snippet `maxi = i` assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `maxi`. Given that `res` is currently `'<'` and `maxi` was previously `0`, the value of `maxi` will now be updated to the value of `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `mini`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is `i`, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, `res` is the input string and the current value of `res` is `'<'`.**
