The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust those for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `res` is the value of the user input.
- If `res` is `'<'`, then `maxi` is the value of `i`. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.
- `i` has taken on a value from the range 1 to `n-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain unchanged. The variables `t`, `res`, and `maxi` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

Given that `i` was 3 at the end of the last iteration (as an example), it would now be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the value of the user input, if `res` is `'<'`, then `maxi` is the value of `i`. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0, `i` is 4**
