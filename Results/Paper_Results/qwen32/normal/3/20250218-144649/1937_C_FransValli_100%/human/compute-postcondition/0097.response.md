To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and how the variables are defined and updated.

1. **Variables and their values based on the initial state:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`.
   - `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`.
   - `res` is the input string. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is updated to `[0, i]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains `[0]`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

2. **Understanding the print statement:**
   - The statement is: `print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)`.
   - This statement will print the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `maxi`, then `arr[0]`, then `maxi` again, and finally `i`.

3. **Determining the values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, and `i`:**
   - Since `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, its value depends on the previous responses.
   - `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` was `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`, so `arr[0]` is `i`.
     - If `res` was `'='`, `arr` is updated to `[0, i]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
     - Otherwise, `arr` remains `[0]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
   - `i` is the current index, which is incremented by 1 from the previous value.

4. **Constructing the output:**
   - The output will be a formatted string starting with `'?'`, followed by `maxi`, then `arr[0]`, then `maxi` again, and finally `i`.

Given the information, the output will be:

Output: **? maxi arr[0] maxi i (where maxi is the largest index i for which the response was '<', arr[0] is the first element of arr which depends on the response res, and i is the current index incremented by 1)**

Since the exact values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, and `i` are not specified in the initial state, we describe their values based on the conditions given.
