The code snippet `arr = [i]` assigns a new list containing only the value of `i` to the variable `arr`. This means `arr` will no longer hold its previous values or structure, but will instead be a list with a single element `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` is `[i]`, `res` is the input string, `i` is `x + 1`.**
