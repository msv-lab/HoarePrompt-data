Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`. `res` is the value of the user input. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains `[0]`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

In simple terms, the value of `res` is now the user's input. Depending on this input, `arr` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged except for `i`, which is incremented by 1.
