The value of `maxi` is updated to the current value of `i`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is `i`, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, `res` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**
