The code snippet provided is `arr = [0]`. This line of code assigns a new list containing a single element, `0`, to the variable `arr`. This means that the previous contents of `arr` are overwritten with this new list.

The initial state of `arr` is described as containing specific indices based on the responses received. However, since the code explicitly sets `arr` to `[0]`, this description is no longer accurate for `arr` after the code is executed.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`) are not affected by this line of code, so their states remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or `0` if no such response was received, `mini` is the smallest element in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`, `arr` is `[0]`.**
