The only object in the loop head is the variable `item`. The loop iterates over `arr[1:]`, which means it will execute if `arr` has more than one element. According to the given state, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from `1` to `n-1`) for which the response was `'='`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least two elements.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `arr` must have at least two elements.
- `item` is the first element of `arr[1:]`, which is `arr[1]`.

Given the provided state, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least two elements. Since `arr` is defined to contain indices where the response was `'='`, we need to ensure that there is at least one such index in addition to `arr[0]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received, `mini` is `arr[0]`, `arr` contains at least two elements where the response was `'='`, `item` is `arr[1]`**
