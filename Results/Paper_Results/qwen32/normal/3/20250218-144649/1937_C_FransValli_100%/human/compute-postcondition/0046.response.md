Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the input integer, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`, `arr` contains all indices `i` (from 1 to n-1) that received a response of `'='`, or the last index that received a `'<'` response, `mini` is `arr[0]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `mini` is now set to the first element of the list `arr`. All other variables retain their previous values.
