The code snippet `mini = item` updates the value of `mini` to be equal to `item`. Therefore, the variable `mini` now holds the value of `item`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is the input integer; `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`; `mini` is `item`; `arr` must have at least two elements; `res` is the new user's input; `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]`.**
