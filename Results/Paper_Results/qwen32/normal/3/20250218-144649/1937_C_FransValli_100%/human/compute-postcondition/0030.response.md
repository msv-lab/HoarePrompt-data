Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user input was `'<'`. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains `[0]`. `res` is either `'<'`, `'='`, or some other value not equal to `'<'`.**
