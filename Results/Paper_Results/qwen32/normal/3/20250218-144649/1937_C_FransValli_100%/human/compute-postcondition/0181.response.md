The code snippet `mini = item` assigns the value of `item` to the variable `mini`. Given that `item` is `arr[1]`, `mini` will now hold the value of `arr[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is at least 2, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'` or 0 if no such response was received, `mini` is `arr[1]`, `arr` contains at least two elements where the response was `'='`, `item` is `arr[1]`, `res` is the input received, and `res` is `'>'`.**
