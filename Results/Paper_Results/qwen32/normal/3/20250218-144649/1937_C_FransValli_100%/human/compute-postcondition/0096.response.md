The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value such that `1 <= i < n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper bound of the range.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` and `n` should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, and `res` is the input string. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is updated to `[0, i]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains `[0]`. `i` is incremented by 1**.

Given the above, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, `mini` is the smallest index among those in `arr` for which the response was `'>'` when compared to the previous `mini`, and `res` is the input string. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is updated to `[0, i]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains `[0]`. `i` is `i + 1`**.
