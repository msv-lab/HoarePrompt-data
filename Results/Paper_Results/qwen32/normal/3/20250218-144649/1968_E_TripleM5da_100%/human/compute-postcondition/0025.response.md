The given `print` statement is `print(1, 2)`. This statement does not depend on the variables `t`, `i`, or `n` as they are not used within the `print` statement. The `print` function in Python outputs the values provided to it separated by spaces.

Here, the values `1` and `2` are explicitly provided to the `print` function.

Output: **1 2**
