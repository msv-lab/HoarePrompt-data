### Reasoning:

The provided program does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances for \( n > 2 \). Let's analyze the program and the annotated code to understand why:

1. **Program Logic:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \).
   - It then prints the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - For \( i \) from 3 to \( n \), it prints the points \((i, i)\).

2. **Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations confirm the program's behavior as described above. For each test case, it outputs the points as specified.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - **For \( n = 2 \):** The program outputs \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\). The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1\}\), which is correct.
   - **For \( n > 2 \):** The program outputs points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((i, i)\) for \( i \) from 3 to \( n \). This arrangement does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

4. **Counterexamples Provided:**
   - For \( n = 3 \), the optimal arrangement is \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 1)\), which gives the distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). The program gives \(\{0, 1, 2, 4\}\).
   - For \( n = 4 \), the optimal arrangement is \((1, 1)\), \((1, 3)\), \((4, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), which gives the distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}\). The program gives \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).
   - For \( n = 5 \) and \( n = 6 \), similar issues arise with the program's output not maximizing the distinct Manhattan distances.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not generate the points that maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances for \( n > 2 \). Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem's requirements.

### Final: **False**
