The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

From the initial state, we know that:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is explicitly set to 3.
- `n` must be greater than 2 (though `n` is also not used in the print statement).

Since `i` is explicitly defined as 3, the print statement `print(i, i)` will output the value of `i` twice.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **3 3**
