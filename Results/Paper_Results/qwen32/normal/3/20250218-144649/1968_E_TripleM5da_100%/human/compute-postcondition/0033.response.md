To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
1. The outer loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer.
2. For each iteration of the outer loop, an integer `n` is read from the input.
3. The inner loop runs from `3` to `n` (inclusive), printing `i, i` for each `i` in this range.
4. Before the inner loop, the code prints `1, 1` and `1, 2`.

### Iteration Process:
- **First Iteration**: 
  - Reads `n1` (let's assume `n1` is the first input integer after `t`).
  - Prints `1, 1` and `1, 2`.
  - Prints `3, 3`, `4, 4`, ..., `n1, n1` (if `n1 >= 3`).

- **Second Iteration**: 
  - Reads `n2` (the next input integer).
  - Prints `1, 1` and `1, 2`.
  - Prints `3, 3`, `4, 4`, ..., `n2, n2` (if `n2 >= 3`).

- **Third Iteration**: 
  - Reads `n3` (the next input integer).
  - Prints `1, 1` and `1, 2`.
  - Prints `3, 3`, `4, 4`, ..., `n3, n3` (if `n3 >= 3`).

- **General Iteration**:
  - For the `k`-th iteration, reads `nk`.
  - Prints `1, 1` and `1, 2`.
  - Prints `3, 3`, `4, 4`, ..., `nk, nk` (if `nk >= 3`).

### Final Output State:
- The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will print `1, 1` and `1, 2`, followed by `i, i` for each `i` from `3` to `n` (if `n >= 3`).

### Conclusion:
The final output state is determined by the number of iterations `t` and the values of `n` for each iteration. The state of `t` remains unchanged, and `i` will be `n + 1` at the end of each inner loop.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, i is n + 1, n is an input integer for each of the t iterations.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations, `t` will still be the initial integer representing the number of test cases, `i` will be `n + 1` for the last iteration's inner loop, and `n` will be the last input integer processed by the loop.
