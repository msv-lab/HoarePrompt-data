The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1` and `i` starts from 3, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute, `i` needs to be set to the starting value of the range, which is 3. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3**
