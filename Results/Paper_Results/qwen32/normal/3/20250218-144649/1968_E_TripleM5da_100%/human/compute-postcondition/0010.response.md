To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand how the loop operates and the constraints given.

The loop iterates from `i = 3` to `i = n` (inclusive), and for each iteration, it prints the value of `i` twice. The loop will execute `n-2` times if `n >= 3`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` is the integer value provided by the input, where 2 <= `n` <= 10^3.

The loop will execute all iterations when `n` is at least 3. The loop will print pairs of numbers starting from `(3, 3)` up to `(n, n)`.

The final output state after all iterations will be:
- `t` remains unchanged, still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes because the loop increments `i` until `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` remains the same as the input value.

The output of the loop itself is a series of printed pairs `(i, i)` for `i` from 3 to `n`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, i is n + 1, n is the input value.**

In simple terms, after the loop has finished executing all iterations, the variable `i` will be `n + 1`, and `t` and `n` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
