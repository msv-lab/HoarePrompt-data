The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value, which happens when the start of the range (3) is less than or equal to the end of the range (`n + 1`).

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3 because if `n` is less than 3, the range will be empty (e.g., `range(3, 3)` or `range(3, 2)`).

The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, but its value does not affect whether the loop will execute. However, it is important to note that the loop will update `i` starting from 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 3**
