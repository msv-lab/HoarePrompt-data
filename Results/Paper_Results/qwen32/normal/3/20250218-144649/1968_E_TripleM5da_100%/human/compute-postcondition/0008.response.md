The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 3 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, and `n` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 6, and `n` must be at least 6 to include `i` in the range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 6, `n` must be at least 6**
