Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; the list `a` contains n integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different; `wins` is 0.**

Natural Language: The variable `wins` has been initialized to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a`) retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
