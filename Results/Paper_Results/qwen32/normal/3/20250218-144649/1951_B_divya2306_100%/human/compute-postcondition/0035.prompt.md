Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will execute until it finds an element `a[i]` that is greater than `a[k-1]` or until it has checked all elements. If it checks all elements without finding one greater than `a[k-1]`, `i` will be `n` and `wins` will be `n`. If it breaks early, `i` will be the index where the condition `a[i] > a[k-1]` is met, and `wins` will be the number of elements checked before breaking. Additionally, `wins` will be less than `k`. `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
    if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
        break
    win_with_swap += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `win_with_swap` is 1, `k` is at least 2, and `i` is 0. If the element at index `i` of the list `a` is greater than the element at index `k - 1` of the list `a`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `win_with_swap` is 2, `k` is at least 2, and `i` is 1. If `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `win_with_swap` is 3, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2. If `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
