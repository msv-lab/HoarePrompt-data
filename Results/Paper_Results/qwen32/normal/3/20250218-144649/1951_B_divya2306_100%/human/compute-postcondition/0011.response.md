Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; the list `a` contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different; `wins` is 2; `i` is 1. If `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simple terms, the value of `wins` has been incremented by 1, so `wins` is now 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
