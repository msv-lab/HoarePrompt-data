The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `wins`, or `i`. It only terminates the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block, but since there is no loop or conditional block provided in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change any variable values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; the list `a` contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different; `wins` is 2; `i` is 2**.
