Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; the list `a` contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different; `wins` is 1; `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `wins`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but no variables are modified by the `break` statement itself.
