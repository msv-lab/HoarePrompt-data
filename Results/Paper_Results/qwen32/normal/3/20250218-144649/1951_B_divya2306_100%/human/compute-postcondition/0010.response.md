Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; the list `a` contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different; `wins` is 1; `i` is 1. If `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
