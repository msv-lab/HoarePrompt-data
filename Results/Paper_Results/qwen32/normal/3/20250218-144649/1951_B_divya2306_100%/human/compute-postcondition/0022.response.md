The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range defined by `win_with_swap` and `k - 1`. To ensure the loop can execute, `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`. 

Here's how we can adjust the state:

1. `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1` to ensure the range is non-empty.
2. `i` should be set to `win_with_swap` as it is the starting point of the loop.

Given the provided information, we can set `win_with_swap` to a value that is less than `k - 1`. For simplicity, let's assume `win_with_swap` is 0 and `k` is at least 2 (so `k - 1` is at least 1).

State: **`win_with_swap` is 0, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 0**
