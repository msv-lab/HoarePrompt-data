Postcondition: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is the integer value of the input. If `n` is equal to 1, then no additional changes are made to `n` or `n_cases`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `floor(log2(n)) + 1`. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains equal to `n`; otherwise, `power` remains `floor(log2(n))`.**
