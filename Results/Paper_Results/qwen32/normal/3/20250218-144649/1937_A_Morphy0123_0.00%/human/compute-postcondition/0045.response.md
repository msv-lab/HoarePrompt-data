To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop condition: `power` and `n`.

The current state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `power` is 2.

The loop condition is:
```
while power < log2(n):
```

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `power < log2(n)` must be true. Given that `power` is currently 2, we need to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 2.

To find the smallest integer `n` for which `log2(n) > 2`, we solve the inequality:
```
log2(n) > 2
```
This is equivalent to:
```
n > 2^2
n > 4
```

Therefore, `n` must be greater than 4 to satisfy the loop condition. The value of `power` remains 2, as it is the only way to ensure that the loop can execute one more time given the current state.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is `i + 1`, `power` is 2**
