The code `power -= 1` decrements the value of `power` by 1. The other variables `n_cases`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Given that `power` was initially `ceil(log2(n))` and not equal to `n`, after decrementing, `power` will be `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `power` is `ceil(log2(n)) - 1` and `power` is not equal to `n`.**
