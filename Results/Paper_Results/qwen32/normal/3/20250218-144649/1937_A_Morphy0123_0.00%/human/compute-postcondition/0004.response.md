Given the initial state, we know that `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is the integer value of the input, and `n` is equal to 1. However, the print statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

This print statement directly outputs the integer value `1`, regardless of the values of `n_cases` or `n`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
