The value of `n` is assigned the integer value of the input. The initial state specifies that `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and this value remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `n` is the integer value of the input.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is the integer value of the input.**
