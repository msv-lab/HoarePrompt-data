To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `power` and `n`.

Given the loop condition `while power < log2(n)`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `power` is less than the base-2 logarithm of `n`.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases (irrelevant to the loop condition).
- `n` must be at least 5.
- `power` is 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must still be less than `log2(n)`. Since `power` is 3, `log2(n)` must be greater than 3. This means `n` must be greater than \(2^3 = 8\).

Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 8 to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 3**
