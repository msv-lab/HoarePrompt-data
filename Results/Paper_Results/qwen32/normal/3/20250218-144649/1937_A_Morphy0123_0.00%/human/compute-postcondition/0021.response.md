The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n_cases`. If `i` is less than `n_cases`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index of the loop and `n_cases` is the total number of iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n_cases` should remain the same.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is the integer value of the input. If `n` is equal to 1, then no additional changes are made to `n` or `n_cases`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `floor(log2(n)) + 1`. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains equal to `n`; otherwise, `power` remains `floor(log2(n))`. `i` is incremented by 1**

Given that only `i` and `n_cases` can be adjusted, and `i` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration:

State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is the integer value of the input. If `n` is equal to 1, then no additional changes are made to `n` or `n_cases`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `floor(log2(n)) + 1`. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains equal to `n`; otherwise, `power` remains `floor(log2(n))`. `i` is 1 more than its previous value**
