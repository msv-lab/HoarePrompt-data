The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `j`, `n`, or `done`. It only causes the program to exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `j`, `n`, and `done` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
