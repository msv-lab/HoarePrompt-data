Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`done`**: This variable is set to `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
2. **`i`**: This variable remains equal to `t`.
3. **`string`**: This is the user's input.
4. **`s`**: This is a list of characters from `string`.
5. **`n`**: This is greater than 0.
6. **`x`**: This is the first character of `string`.
7. **`j`**: This variable is incremented by 1.
8. **`count`**: This is set to `j` if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, the loop or if statement breaks.

### Key Points:
- The print statement is `print('YES')`.
- The value to be printed is a string literal `'YES'`, which does not depend on the values of the variables `done`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, or `count`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement `print('YES')` will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state. This is because the print statement is explicitly printing the string `'YES'` and not any variable or computed value.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
