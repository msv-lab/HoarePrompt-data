Output State: **`j` is `j + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `j` remains `j + 2`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `done` remains True. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of the variables.
