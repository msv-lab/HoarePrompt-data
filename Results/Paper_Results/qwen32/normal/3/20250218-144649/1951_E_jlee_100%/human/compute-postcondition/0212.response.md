The given initial state describes several conditions and variables, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the specific values of the variables. The code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `count`, `done`, `count2`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
