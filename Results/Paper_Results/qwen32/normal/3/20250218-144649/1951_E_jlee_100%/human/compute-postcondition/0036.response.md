Given the initial state and the `print` statement, let's break down what will be printed:

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is initialized to 0.
3. `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
4. `string` is the input string.
5. `n` must be greater than 0.
6. `done` is set to False.
7. `count` and `count2` are both initialized to 0.
8. `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` for some `j`.

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, or any other variables. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided as the argument to the `print` function.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
