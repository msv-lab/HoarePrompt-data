Postcondition: **`j` is `j + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`. If `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 0 if `count2` is less than `count`; otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count2`.**
