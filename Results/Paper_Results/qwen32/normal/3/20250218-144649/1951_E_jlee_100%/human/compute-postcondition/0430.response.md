Postcondition: **`j` is `j + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged. If `count2 > count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`.**
