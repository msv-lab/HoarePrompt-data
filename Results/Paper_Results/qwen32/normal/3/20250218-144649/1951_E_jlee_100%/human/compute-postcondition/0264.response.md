Postcondition: **`done` is `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged. `i` remains equal to `t`, `string` remains the user's input, `s` remains a list of characters from `string`, `n` remains greater than 0, `x` remains the first character of `string`, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
