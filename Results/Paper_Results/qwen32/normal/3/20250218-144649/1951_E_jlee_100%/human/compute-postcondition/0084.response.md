The code snippet provided only assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `done`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `count2`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `done` is True**.
