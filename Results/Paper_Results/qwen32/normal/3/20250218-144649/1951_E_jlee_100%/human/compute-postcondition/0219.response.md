Postcondition: **`count` is greater than 0, `done` is `True` if `count` is greater than 1 or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains `False`. `count2` is less than or equal to `count`, and if `count2` was less than `count`, it is updated to `count` if `count` is greater than 1. `i` remains equal to `t`, `string` remains the user's input, `s` remains a list of characters from `string`, and `n` remains greater than 0. `x` remains the first character of `string`. `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count` was less than 1 before this condition, `count` is set to `j`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `count2` is updated to `count` or if `count` is greater than 1.**
