Postcondition: **`done` is `True` if `count2 > count`; `i` remains equal to `t`; `string` remains the user's input; `s` remains a list of characters from `string`; `n` remains greater than 0; `x` remains the first character of `string`; `j` is incremented by 1; `count` is equal to `j` if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`. The loop or if statement is broken out of if `count2 > count`.**
