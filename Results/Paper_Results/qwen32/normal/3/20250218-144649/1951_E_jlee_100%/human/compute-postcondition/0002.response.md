The code snippet provided is `string = input()`. This line of code takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `string`. The variable `t` and `i` are not affected by this line of code. The variable `s` is mentioned in the initial state but is not used in the given code snippet, so it remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of lowercase Latin characters with length 1 <= |`s`| <= 10^6, and `string` is the input string.**
