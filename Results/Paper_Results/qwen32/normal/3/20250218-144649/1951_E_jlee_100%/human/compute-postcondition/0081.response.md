The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `count2`, `j`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. The text inside the `print` function is a literal string `'YES'`.
3. No variables from the initial state are involved in the `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output will be exactly the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
