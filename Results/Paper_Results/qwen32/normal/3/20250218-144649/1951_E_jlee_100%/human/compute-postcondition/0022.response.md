Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, and `done` is False. The count of the first character `x` in the list `s` is `n - 1`. The length of `s` (`n`) is odd, and the middle character of `s` (at index `(n - 1) // 2`) is not `x`.**
