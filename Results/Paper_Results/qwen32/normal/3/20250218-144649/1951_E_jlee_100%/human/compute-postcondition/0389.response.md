Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `count` remains `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, `count` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged. `count2` is 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the state of all variables remains the same as described in the initial state.
