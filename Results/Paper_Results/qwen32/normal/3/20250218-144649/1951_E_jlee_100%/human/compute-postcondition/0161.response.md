Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Loop Completion**: The loop has completed all `n` iterations without setting `done` to `True`. This means `done` remains `False`.
2. **Variables**:
   - `done`: `False`
   - `count` and `count2`: These variables reflect the final state of the character checks after the loop, but their exact values are not specified.
   - `i`: Equal to `t`, but the value of `t` is not specified.
   - `string`: This is the user's input, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `s`: A list of characters from `string`.
   - `n`: Equal to the length of the list `s`, which is the length of `string`.
   - `x`: The first character of `string`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided and will be printed regardless of the values of `done`, `count`, `count2`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, or `x`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
