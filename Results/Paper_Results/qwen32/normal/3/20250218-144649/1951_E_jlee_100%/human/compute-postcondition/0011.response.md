Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, and `x` is the first character of `string`. The first character of `string` (`x`) is not equal to the last character of `string` (`s[-1]`).**
