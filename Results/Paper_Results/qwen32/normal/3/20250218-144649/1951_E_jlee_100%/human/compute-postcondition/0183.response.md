Output State: **`done` is `True`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is equal to `t`, `string` is the user's input, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `string`, and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `done`, which is now `True`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
