Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the string `string`, `string` is the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is greater than 0, and `count2` is either 0 or 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False, and the loop or if statement is broken if `count2` is less than `count`. If `count2` is equal to or greater than `count` and `count` is equal to 1, `done` is determined based on whether `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1.**
