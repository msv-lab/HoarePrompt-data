Postcondition: **The loop has completed all `n` iterations without setting `done` to `True`. The variables `t`, `i`, `done`, `count`, and `count2` are in their final states as determined by the loop's execution. Specifically, `done` remains `False`, and `count` and `count2` reflect the final state of the character checks. `i` is equal to `t`. `string` is the user's input. `s` is a list of characters from `string`. `n` is equal to the length of the list `s`. If `n` is equal to 1, the conditions mentioned above still hold true.**
