The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `t` is a positive integer and each of the `t` test cases is described by three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, the code snippet does not affect `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. It only introduces a new variable `n`.

Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the t test cases is described by three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; n is an input integer.**
