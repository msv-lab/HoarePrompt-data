The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, to determine whether the loop can execute, we need to focus on these variables. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is the loop index and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so we do not need to adjust it before the loop starts.

Given the initial state, the only thing we need to adjust is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the t test cases is described by three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` must be greater than 0**
