The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the value `-1`. This value is explicitly specified in the `print` statement and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `n`, or `k` that are described in the initial state.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `n`, `k`) and their values or ranges.
2. The `print` statement is `print(-1)`.
3. The value `-1` is explicitly given and does not rely on any of the variables or their values.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
