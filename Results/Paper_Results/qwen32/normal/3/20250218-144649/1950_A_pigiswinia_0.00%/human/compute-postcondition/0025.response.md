Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9, and `i` is 2. If `a < b < c`, the condition `a < b < c` is true and `i` remains 2. Otherwise, the condition `a < b < c` is false, and `i` remains 2. The value of `i` does not change regardless of the conditions evaluated.**
