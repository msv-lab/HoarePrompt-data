The task requires us to determine what will be printed by the `print` statement given the initial state of the variables and objects. Let's break down the provided information:

- `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
- `i` is set to the integer value 2.

Now, let's look at the provided code snippet:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

The `print` statement is printing the string `'PEAK'`. There are no variables or objects in this string that need to be evaluated based on the initial state. The string `'PEAK'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **PEAK**
