You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is the integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and the loop has executed `t` times. For each of the `t` iterations, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9. The loop has printed 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` hold the values from the last iteration, and `i` is equal to `t` after the loop finishes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given problem requires us to determine whether a set of three digits forms a "stair", a "peak", or neither. The conditions for a "stair" are that the digits must be strictly increasing (a < b < c), and the conditions for a "peak" are that the middle digit must be strictly greater than the other two (a < b > c). If neither of these conditions is met, the result should be "NONE".

The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading three digits. It checks the conditions for "stair" and "peak" and prints the appropriate result for each case.

However, there is a small mistake in the program. In the condition for a "stair", it incorrectly prints 'STAIRS' instead of 'STAIR'. This is a typo and needs to be corrected for the program to be fully accurate.

To summarize, the logic of the program is correct, but there is a typo in the output string for the "stair" condition.

Correctness: **False**
