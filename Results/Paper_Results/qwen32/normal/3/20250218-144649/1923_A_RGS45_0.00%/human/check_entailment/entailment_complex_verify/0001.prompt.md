You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in the list for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: t is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a binary string of length `n` (containing only 0s and 1s with at least one 1). It then counts and prints the number of 0s between the first and last occurrence of 1 in the string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

**Problem Analysis:**
The task is to move chips in such a way that they form a single contiguous block with no free cells between them. The operation allowed is to move a chip to the closest free cell to its left. The goal is to determine the minimum number of such operations required.

**Program Analysis:**
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of cells and the state of each cell (whether it contains a chip or is free). It then finds the first occurrence of a chip from the left (`x`) and the first occurrence of a chip from the right (`y`). The substring from `x` to `n - y` is considered (`z`), and the number of free cells (0s) in this substring is printed as the result.

**Issues with the Program:**
1. **Finding the correct range for chips:** The program calculates `z` as `arr[x:n - y]`. This is incorrect because `n - y` does not give the correct end index of the range of chips. Instead, `n - y - 1` would be the correct index, but even then, this approach is flawed.
2. **Counting the operations:** The program counts the number of free cells (0s) in the substring `z`, which does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations required to form a contiguous block of chips.
3. **Edge cases:** The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when all chips are already in a contiguous block, it might not return 0 operations correctly.

**Correct Approach:**
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Identify the leftmost and rightmost chips.
- Calculate the number of free cells between these two positions.
- The number of operations required is the number of free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

**Conclusion:**
The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips. It has logical errors in handling the range of chips and counting the operations.

Correctness: **False**
