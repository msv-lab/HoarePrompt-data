Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to move the chips so that they form a single contiguous block with no free cells between them. The minimum number of moves required to achieve this is the number of free cells within the range of the leftmost and rightmost chips.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the configuration of chips and free cells as a string `arr`.

2. **Finding the Range of Chips:**
   - `x = arr.find('1')`: This finds the index of the leftmost chip (first occurrence of '1').
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`: This finds the index of the rightmost chip from the end of the string. The `[::-1]` reverses the string, and `find('1')` finds the first '1' in the reversed string, which corresponds to the rightmost '1' in the original string.

3. **Counting Free Cells in the Range:**
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]`: This is supposed to be the substring from the leftmost chip to the rightmost chip. However, there is an error in this line. The correct way to get the substring from the leftmost to the rightmost chip is `arr[x:n - y]` should be `arr[x:n - y + 1]` or `arr[x:len(arr) - y]` to include the rightmost chip.
   - `print(z.count('0'))`: This counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the substring `z`, which should give the minimum number of moves required.

### Error in the Program

The main issue in the program is in the line `z = arr[x:n - y]`. Since `y` is the index of the rightmost '1' from the end, `n - y` is not the correct endpoint for the substring. It should be `len(arr) - y` or `n - y + 1` to correctly include the rightmost chip in the substring.

### Corrected Program

A corrected version of the program would look like this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = input().strip()  # Read the configuration as a string and strip any extra spaces
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:len(arr) - y]  # Corrected the substring range
        print(z.count('0'))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion

Given the error in the program, the program as provided is not correct. The corrected version should be used.

**Correctness: False**
