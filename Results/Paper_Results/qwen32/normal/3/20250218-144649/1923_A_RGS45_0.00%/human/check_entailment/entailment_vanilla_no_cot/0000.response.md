Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Input Parsing**: The input for each test case is read as a string and then used directly in operations. While this might work for the first test case, it does not correctly parse the input into a list of integers as required. The input should be split and converted to integers.

2. **Logic for Finding Minimum Operations**:
   - The program finds the first occurrence of '1' and the last occurrence of '1' in the string representation of the array.
   - It then slices the array between these two points and counts the number of '0's in this slice. This logic does not correctly account for the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together.
   
   For example, in the first test case, the array is `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`. The program finds the first '1' at index 1 and the last '1' at index 6. It then slices the array from index 1 to 6 (which is `1 1 1 0 1 1`) and counts the '0's, which is 1. This is correct for this specific case, but the logic is flawed and does not generalize correctly.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve iterating through the array and keeping track of the number of free cells (0's) encountered before the first chip (1) and the number of moves required to bring each subsequent chip to the end of the current block of chips.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        moves = 0
        block_end = -1
        
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == 1:
                if block_end == -1:
                    block_end = i
                else:
                    moves += i - block_end - 1
                    block_end += 1
        
        print(moves)

func()
```

This corrected version reads the input correctly, and the logic correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together into a single block.
