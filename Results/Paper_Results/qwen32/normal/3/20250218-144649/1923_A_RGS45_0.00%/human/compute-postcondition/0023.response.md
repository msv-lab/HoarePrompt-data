Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of `n` integers (each being either 0 or 1) with at least one 1 in the list. For each test case, the function returns the count of 1s in the list.**
