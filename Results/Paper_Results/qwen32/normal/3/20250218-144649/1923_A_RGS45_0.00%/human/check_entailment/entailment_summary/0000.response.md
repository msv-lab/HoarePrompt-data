Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by finding the first and last occurrence of a chip ('1') in the ribbon and then counting the number of free cells ('0') between these two positions. However, this approach does not correctly account for the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single contiguous block.

Consider the example from the problem statement:
```
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The program will find the first '1' at index 1 and the last '1' at index 6. It then counts the number of '0's between these two positions, which is 1. However, to form a single block, we can move the chip at index 6 to index 4, resulting in the configuration `0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0`, and then move the chip at index 6 to index 5, resulting in `0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0`. This requires only 1 operation, which is correct.

However, the program's logic does not always yield the correct result. For instance, consider the following case:
```
9
0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1
```
The first '1' is at index 1 and the last '1' is at index 8. The number of '0's between these two positions is 6, but the minimum number of operations required to form a single block is 4 (move the chip at index 8 to index 5, then to index 4, then to index 3, and finally to index 2).

The program fails to consider the optimal sequence of moves that minimizes the total number of operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
