The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `N` is an integer read from the input such that `N` must be greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `num` is `nums[i]`, and `arr` is unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `N` remains the same because it is the loop's upper bound condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `N` is an integer read from the input such that N must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `num` is `nums[i]`, `arr` is unchanged**.
