To determine the output of the `print(s - 1, s)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step-by-step:

1. **Variables and Initial Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `N` is an integer read from the input.
   - `i` is set to `N`.
   - `num` is initialized to `-1`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers read from the input as a tuple.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
   - `s` and `e` are the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - The current value of `s` is not equal to 1.
   - There are conditions involving `tc` and `ppp`, but they do not affect the values of `s` and `e` in this context.

2. **Relevant Information for the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(s - 1, s)`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `s` is not equal to 1.

3. **Determine the Values of `s` and `s - 1`:**
   - Since `s` is not equal to 1, it can be any integer value except 1.
   - The value of `s - 1` is simply `s` minus 1.

4. **Formulate the Output:**
   - The output will be the values of `s - 1` and `s` in that order.

Given the above analysis, the output can be described as:

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr and s is not equal to 1)**

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we express the output in terms of `s`.
