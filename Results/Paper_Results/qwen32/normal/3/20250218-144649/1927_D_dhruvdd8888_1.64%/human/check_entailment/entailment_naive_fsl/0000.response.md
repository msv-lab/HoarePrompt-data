Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program seems to have a flawed logic for handling queries and finding pairs of different elements within the specified range. Here are some issues and a specific counterexample:

1. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment of the array where the elements are the same. However, the logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` is flawed. The program does not correctly check for different elements within the specified range `[l, r]`.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle all edge cases, especially when the range `[l, r]` contains only one unique element or when the range is very small.

Let's consider a specific counterexample:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
3
1 2 1
1
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1 2
```

Explanation of the Expected Output:
In the range `[1, 3]`, the elements are `1, 2, 1`. The pairs `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)` are valid pairs where `a_i != a_j`. The program should return any of these pairs.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program might output `-1 -1` for this input, which is incorrect.

The program should correctly iterate over the range `[l, r]` and find any two different elements. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
from sys import stdin

def handle_test_case():
    N = int(stdin.readline())
    nums = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))
    q = int(stdin.readline())
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        l -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        r -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        found = False
        for i in range(l, r):
            for j in range(i + 1, r + 1):
                if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                    print(i + 1, j + 1)  # Convert back to 1-based index
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            print(-1, -1)

def main():
    tc = int(stdin.readline())
    for _ in range(tc):
        handle_test_case()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version ensures that for each query, it correctly finds a pair of different elements within the specified range `[l, r]` or reports that such a pair does not exist.
