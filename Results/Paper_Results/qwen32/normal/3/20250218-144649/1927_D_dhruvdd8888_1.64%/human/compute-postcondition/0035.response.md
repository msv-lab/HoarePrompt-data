Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input; `i` is `N`; `num` is `-1`; `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are integers read from the input as a tuple; `tc` is greater than 5. If `ppp` is equal to 23, the condition is met as described. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. The program will simply move to the next iteration of the loop if it is inside one. All other conditions and variable states remain the same as described in the initial state.
