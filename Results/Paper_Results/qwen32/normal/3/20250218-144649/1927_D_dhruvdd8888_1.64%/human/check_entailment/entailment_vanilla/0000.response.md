Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find two different indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a subarray defined by \(l\) and \(r\) such that \(a_i \neq a_j\). If such a pair does not exist, the program should output \(-1 -1\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array, the array itself, the number of queries, and then the queries.

2. **Array Segmentation:**
   - The program segments the array into contiguous segments of identical elements. This is done with the help of a loop that iterates through the array and records the start and end indices of each segment along with the element value.
   - The segments are stored in the list `arr`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or after the left boundary of the query.
   - Depending on the position of the found segment, the program attempts to find two different indices within the query range that correspond to different values.

4. **Output:**
   - If a valid pair of indices is found, they are printed.
   - If no such pair is found, \(-1 -1\) is printed.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Handling of Segments:**
  - The program does not correctly handle all cases where a valid pair of indices should be found.
  - The logic for checking segments and finding valid indices is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly check if there is a segment that ends before the right boundary of the query or if there is a segment that starts after the left boundary.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the subarray consists of only one unique element correctly.
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray has exactly two different elements.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
