Let's analyze the given task step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `N` is an integer read from the input.
3. `i` is initialized to `N`.
4. `num` is initialized to `-1`.
5. `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
6. `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
7. `l` and `r` are integers read from the input as a tuple.
8. `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
9. `s` and `e` are the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
10. The state remains unchanged unless `tc` is greater than 5 and `ppp` is equal to 23, but these conditions are not met in the given state.

### Code to Execute
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis of the Code
The `print` statement is straightforward. It prints the values `-1` and `-1` separated by a space. The values of variables `t`, `N`, `i`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, and `e` do not affect this specific `print` statement because it is explicitly printing the values `-1` and `-1`.

### Final Output
Output: **-1, -1**
