Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, l and r are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all q across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
