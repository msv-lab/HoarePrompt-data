To determine what will be printed by the `print(s, e + 1)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Setup**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `N` is an integer read from the input.
   - `i` is initialized to `N`.
   - `num` is initialized to `-1`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are new integers read from the input as a tuple.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
   - `s` and `e` are the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

2. **Key Variables for Output**:
   - `s` and `e` are derived from the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - The output statement is `print(s, e + 1)`.

### Determining `s` and `e`

- `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`. The tuples are likely in the form `(start_index, end_index, value)`.
- `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order. This means `eli` is the position where the segment starting at `l` would fit in the sorted list of segments.
- `s` and `e` are the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

### Output Interpretation

- `s` is the start index of the segment at `min(eli, LA)`.
- `e` is the end index of the segment at `min(eli, LA)`.
- `e + 1` would be the index just after the end of this segment.

### Final Output

Given the information, the output will be the start index `s` of the segment and the index just after the end of the segment `e + 1`.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s and e are the start and end indices of the segment at index min(eli, LA) in the list `arr`)**
