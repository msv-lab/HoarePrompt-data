Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input such that N must be greater than or equal to 0; `i` is 0. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `arr` contains a new element `(1 + s, i, num)` where `s` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `arr`.**
