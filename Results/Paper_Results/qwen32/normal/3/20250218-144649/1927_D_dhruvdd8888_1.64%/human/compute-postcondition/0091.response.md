The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters directly. Instead, it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes:
- An integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - An integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
  - A list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
  - An integer `q` representing the number of queries.
  - For each query, two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= l < r <= n.

The function processes these inputs and returns the results of the queries. Specifically:
- Case_1: For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the function calculates and returns the sum of the elements in the list `a` from index `l` to `r` (inclusive).

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a series of queries. For each query, it calculates and returns the sum of a specified subarray of the list.**
