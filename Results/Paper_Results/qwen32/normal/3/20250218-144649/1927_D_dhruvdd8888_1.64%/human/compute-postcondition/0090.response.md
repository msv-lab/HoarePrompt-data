To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided information.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `N` is an integer read from the input.
   - `i` is set to `N`.
   - `num` is `-1`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `ppp` remains 23 if it equals 23, otherwise no change.
   
2. **Loop Code:**
   - The loop runs for a number of times equal to the integer read from the input.
   - For each iteration:
     - `l` and `r` are read as a tuple of integers.
     - If `tc > 5` and `ppp == 23`, it prints `l` and `r` and continues to the next iteration.
     - Otherwise, it calculates `eli` as the insertion index of `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`.
     - It then extracts `s` and `e` from the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
     - Based on the values of `s` and `e` relative to `l` and `r`, it prints certain values or continues without printing.

### Observations:
- The variables `t`, `N`, `i`, `num`, `arr`, and `LA` are not modified within the loop.
- The loop reads `l` and `r` for each iteration but does not modify them outside the loop scope.
- The variable `tc` is not defined in the provided code, so it is assumed to be a constant or defined elsewhere and not affecting the state of the loop variables.
- The variable `ppp` is only checked for a specific value (23) and does not change the state of other variables.

### Final Output State:
- After all iterations of the loop have finished, the state of the variables will remain the same as the initial state, except for the fact that the loop has processed all input queries.

### Conclusion:
The output state after all iterations of the loop have finished will be the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the loop has processed all the input queries.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input; `i` is `N`; `num` is `-1`; `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `ppp` remains 23 if it equals 23, otherwise no change.**
