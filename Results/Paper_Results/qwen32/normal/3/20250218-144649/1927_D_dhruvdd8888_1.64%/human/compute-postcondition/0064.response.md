The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(-1, -1)`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `N`, `i`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, `e`, or `tc`. It simply prints the values `-1` and `-1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`.
2. The values `-1` and `-1` are explicitly provided in the statement.
3. These values do not change based on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **-1, -1**
