The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1, -1`. This print statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The values `-1` and `-1` are explicitly specified in the print statement itself.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `N`, `i`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, `e`, `tc`, `ppp`), but none of these variables are used in the print statement.
2. The print statement is `print(-1, -1)`, which directly outputs the values `-1` and `-1`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **-1, -1**
