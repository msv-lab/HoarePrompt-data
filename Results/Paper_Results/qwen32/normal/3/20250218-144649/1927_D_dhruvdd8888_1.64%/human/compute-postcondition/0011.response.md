The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `s`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `s` will be assigned the value 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input such that N must be greater than or equal to 0; `i` is 0; `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`; `arr` contains a new element `(1 + s, i, num)`; `s` is 0.**
