The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs two values: `-1` and `-1`. The initial state description provides information about various variables (`t`, `N`, `i`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, `e`, `tc`, `ppp`), but these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement because the statement explicitly prints `-1, -1` regardless of the values of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the provided variables or their values.

Output: **-1, -1**
