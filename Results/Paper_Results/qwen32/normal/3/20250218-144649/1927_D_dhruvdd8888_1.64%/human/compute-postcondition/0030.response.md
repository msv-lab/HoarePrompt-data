The given code snippet reads a tuple of two integers from the input and assigns them to `l` and `r`. This means that the values of `l` and `r` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `i`, `num`, `arr`, and `LA`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input; `i` is `N`; `num` is `-1`; `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are integers read from the input as a tuple.**
