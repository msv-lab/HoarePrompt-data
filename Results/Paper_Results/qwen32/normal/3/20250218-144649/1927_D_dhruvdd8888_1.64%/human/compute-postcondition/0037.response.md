The code snippet provided uses `bisect_left` to find the insertion point for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the list `arr`. This operation does not modify the list `arr` but instead returns an integer index which is stored in the variable `eli`.

Given the initial state, the value of `eli` will be determined based on the contents of `arr` and the value of `l`. Since the specific contents of `arr` and the value of `l` are not provided, we can only describe the state in terms of the operation performed.

Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input; `i` is `N`; `num` is `-1`; `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are integers read from the input as a tuple; `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`. If `tc` is greater than 5 and `ppp` is equal to 23, the condition is met as described. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4; `N`, `i`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, and `r` retain their initial values; `eli` is determined by the position where `(l, 0, 0)` would fit in the sorted list `arr`. The condition involving `tc` and `ppp` remains unchanged.
