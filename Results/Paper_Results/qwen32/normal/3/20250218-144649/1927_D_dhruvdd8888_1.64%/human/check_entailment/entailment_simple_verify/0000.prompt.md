You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program seems to have a flawed logic for handling queries and finding pairs of different elements within the specified range. Here are some issues and a specific counterexample:

1. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment of the array where the elements are the same. However, the logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` is flawed. The program does not correctly check for different elements within the specified range `[l, r]`.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle all edge cases, especially when the range `[l, r]` contains only one unique element or when the range is very small.

Let's consider a specific counterexample:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
3
1 2 1
1
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1 2
```

Explanation of the Expected Output:
In the range `[1, 3]`, the elements are `1, 2, 1`. The pairs `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)` are valid pairs where `a_i != a_j`. The program should return any of these pairs.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program might output `-1 -1` for this input, which is incorrect.

The program should correctly iterate over the range `[l, r]` and find any two different elements. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
from sys import stdin

def handle_test_case():
    N = int(stdin.readline())
    nums = list(map(int, stdin.readline().split()))
    q = int(stdin.readline())
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        l -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        r -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        found = False
        for i in range(l, r):
            for j in range(i + 1, r + 1):
                if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                    print(i + 1, j + 1)  # Convert back to 1-based index
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            print(-1, -1)

def main():
    tc = int(stdin.readline())
    for _ in range(tc):
        handle_test_case()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version ensures that for each query, it correctly finds a pair of different elements within the specified range `[l, r]` or reports that such a pair does not exist.
