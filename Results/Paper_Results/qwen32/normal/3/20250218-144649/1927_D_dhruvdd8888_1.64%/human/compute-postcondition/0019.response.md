The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `N` is an integer read from the input such that N must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, `num` is `nums[i]`, `arr` is unchanged if `nums[i]` equals `num`. Otherwise, `arr` has a new element `(1 + s, 1, nums[i])` appended to it, and `s` is 1.**
