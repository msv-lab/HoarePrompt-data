The code snippet provided decrements the value of `lex` by 1. Therefore, if `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26, it will now be less than or equal to 25. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing the single element 1, and `lex` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 25.**
