The code appends the integer `26` to the list `arr`. This means that the list `arr`, which previously contained either the integer `1` or the integer `26`, now has an additional `26` appended to it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing either the integer 1 or the integer 26, and now includes an additional 26, `lex` is an integer greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**.
