The code snippet `lex = lex - 26` directly adjusts the value of `lex` by subtracting 26 from it. Given the initial state, `lex` was already adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 26` if it was 52 or greater. After executing this line, `lex` will be further reduced by 26.

Since `lex` was originally adjusted to be within 0 < `lex` < 26, subtracting 26 from it would result in a negative value, which contradicts the precondition that `lex` should be in the range 0 < `lex` < 26 after the initial adjustment. Therefore, this line of code would typically be executed under the condition that `lex` was originally 52 or greater, making `lex - 26` a valid positive integer within the range 0 < `lex` < 26 after the initial adjustment.

Thus, after the execution of `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` will be a value that is 26 less than its original adjusted value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 26] if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, or [26, 26] if `lex` was greater than 26, `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` < 26 after subtracting 26, `j` is 1, `k` is 3.**
