The code snippet `lex = lex - 26` modifies the value of `lex` by subtracting 26 from it. Let's break down the possible scenarios based on the initial conditions:

1. If `lex` was initially between 1 and 26, it is now between -25 and 0.
2. If `lex` was initially between 27 and 51, it is now between 1 and 25.
3. If `lex` was initially greater than 51, it remains greater than 25.

The other variables `t`, `cases`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing three elements where the first element is 1 if `lex` (initially) is less than or equal to 25, or 26 if `lex` (initially) is greater than 25, the second element is 1 if `lex` was initially between 1 and 26, or 26 otherwise, and the third element is 26, `lex` is modified to be between -25 and 0 if it was initially between 1 and 26, between 1 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or greater than 25 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1.**
