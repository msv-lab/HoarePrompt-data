The provided loop runs for `j` in the range of 2, meaning it will execute exactly 2 times, not 3. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations (2 times) is as follows:

Given the loop:
```python
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
```

- **Iteration 1**: 
  - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` will append 1, and `lex` will be decreased by 1.
  - If `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` will append 26, and `lex` will be decreased by 26.
  - If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` will append 26, and `lex` will be decreased by 26.

- **Iteration 2**:
  - The same logic applies as in Iteration 1, but now with the updated value of `lex`.

After 2 iterations, the loop will terminate because `j` will have reached the end of its range.

**Output State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, cases is greater than or equal to 1, i is 1, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, arr is a list containing either the integer 1 or the integer 26 with an additional 1 appended if lex <= 26, or an additional 26 appended if lex > 26, followed by another 1 if lex <= 26, or an additional 26 if lex > 26, lex is an integer greater than 0 minus 2 if lex <= 26, or minus 27 if lex > 26, and then minus 24 more if lex > 26, j is 2, k is 3.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes its 2 iterations:
- `arr` will have either `[1, 1]` if `lex` was initially 2 or less.
- `arr` will have either `[1, 26]` if `lex` was initially between 27 and 27.
- `arr` will have either `[26, 1]` if `lex` was initially between 27 and 52.
- `arr` will have either `[26, 26]` if `lex` was initially 53 or more.
- `lex` will be reduced by 2 if it was initially 2 or less, by 27 if it was between 27 and 52, or by 52 if it was 53 or more.
- `j` will be 2, marking the end of the loop.
- All other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, cases is greater than or equal to 1, i is 1, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, arr is a list containing either [1, 1], [1, 26], [26, 1], or [26, 26] based on the initial value of lex, lex is reduced by 2, 27, or 52 based on the initial value of lex, j is 2, k is 3.**
