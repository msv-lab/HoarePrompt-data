Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing the single element 1, and `lex` is an input integer that is less than or equal to 26.**

In simple terms, the list `arr` now contains one element, which is the integer `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
