The code snippet appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing either the integer 1 or the integer 26 with an additional 1 appended if `lex` <= 26, or an additional 26 appended if `lex` > 26, followed by an additional 26, `lex` is an integer greater than 0 minus 1 if `lex` <= 26, or minus 26 if `lex` > 26, `j` is 2, `k` is 3**.
