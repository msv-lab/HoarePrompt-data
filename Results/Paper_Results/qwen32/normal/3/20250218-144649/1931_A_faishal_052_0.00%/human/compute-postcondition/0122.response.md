Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1, 1], [26, 1, 1], [1, 26, 1], [26, 26, 1], [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26] depending on the original value of `lex`, `lex` is adjusted based on its original value (either `lex - 2`, `lex - 28`, or `lex - 53`), `j` is 2, and `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` has a third element of 1. If `lex` was originally greater than 26, `arr` has a third element of 26. The adjusted `lex` is in the range -25 to 51.**
