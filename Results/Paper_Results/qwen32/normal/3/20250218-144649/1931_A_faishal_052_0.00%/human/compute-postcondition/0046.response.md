The code snippet `arr = []` reassigns the variable `arr` to an empty list. This means that the previous sorted array based on the value of `lex` is discarded, and `arr` is now an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is modified to be between 0 and 25 if it was initially between 1 and 51, between -25 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or greater than 51 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**
