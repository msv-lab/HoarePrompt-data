Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded value. The logic for distributing the encoded value among the three letters is flawed, and it does not ensure that the resulting word is the smallest possible in lexicographical order.

Here's a breakdown of the issues in the program:

1. The program attempts to distribute the encoded value `lex` among three letters. However, it does not ensure that the distribution results in the smallest possible lexicographical order.
2. The program incorrectly checks conditions for `lex` being less than or equal to 26 or less than 52. This results in incorrect values being assigned to the letters.
3. The program does not correctly handle the case where the remaining value after assigning the first two letters is greater than 26, which can lead to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Start with the smallest possible letters
        a = b = c = 1
        lex -= 3  # Subtract the initial sum of 'aaa'
        
        # Distribute the remaining value to get the smallest lexicographical order
        if lex > 0:
            b += min(25, lex)
            lex -= min(25, lex)
            if lex > 0:
                c += lex
        
        # Convert numbers to corresponding letters
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- We start by assuming the word is "aaa" and subtract 3 from `lex`.
- We then distribute the remaining value to `b` and `c` in such a way that the resulting word is the smallest possible in lexicographical order.
- Finally, we convert the numbers to corresponding letters and print the result.
