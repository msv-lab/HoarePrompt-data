The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the end of the list `arr`. This affects the `arr` variable by appending 26 to it.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.
- `arr` is a list containing either the integer 1 or the integer 26 with an additional 1 appended if `lex` <= 26, or an additional 26 appended if `lex` > 26.
- `lex` is an integer greater than 0 minus 1 if `lex` <= 26, or minus 26 if `lex` > 26.
- `j` is 2.
- `k` is 3.

After appending 26 to `arr`, the new state of `arr` will be the original `arr` with 26 added to the end. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list containing either the integer 1 or the integer 26 with an additional 1 appended if `lex` <= 26, or an additional 26 appended if `lex` > 26, and then an additional 26 appended, `lex` is an integer greater than 0 minus 1 if `lex` <= 26, or minus 26 if `lex` > 26, `j` is 2, `k` is 3.**
