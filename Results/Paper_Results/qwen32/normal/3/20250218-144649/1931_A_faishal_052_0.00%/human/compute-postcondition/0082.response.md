The only variable in the loop head is `k`. The loop iterates over the range `(3)`, meaning `k` will take values 0, 1, and 2. According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is within the range specified in the loop head.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `cases` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78
- `arr` is a list sorted in ascending order based on the initial value of `lex`
- `lex` is reduced by 2, 27, or 52 based on the initial value of `lex`
- `j` is 2
- `k` is 3

Since `k` is initialized to 3, the loop will not execute because 3 is not within the range of 0 to 2. To ensure the loop executes, `k` must be adjusted to be within the range of the loop head, i.e., 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is a list sorted in ascending order based on the initial value of `lex`, `lex` is reduced by 2, 27, or 52 based on the initial value of `lex`, `j` is 2, `k` is 0**
