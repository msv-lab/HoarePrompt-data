The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the end of the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` can either be `[1]` or `[26]`. After appending 26, `arr` will be either `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]`.

The other variables `t`, `cases`, `i`, `n`, `lex`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 26] or [26, 26], `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 26` if it was 52 or greater, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**.
