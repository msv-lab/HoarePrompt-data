Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1] if `lex` was less than or equal to 25, or [26] if `lex` was greater than 26, `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 26` if it was 52 or greater, `j` is 0, `k` is 3.**
