The value of `lex` is updated by subtracting 26 from its current value. Since `lex` is greater than 52, after the operation, `lex` will still be greater than 26. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is [26], `lex` is an integer greater than 26 (specifically, `lex - 26`), `j` is 0, `k` is 3**.
