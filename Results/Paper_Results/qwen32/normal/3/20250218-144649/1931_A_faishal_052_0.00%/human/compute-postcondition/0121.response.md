Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1, 26] if `lex + 26` was less than or equal to 25, [26, 1, 26] if `lex + 26` was between 26 and 51, or [1, 26, 26] or [26, 26, 26] if `lex + 26` was 52 or greater, `lex` is adjusted to be `lex - 53` if it was originally 52 or greater, or `lex - 53` if it was originally 52 or greater, `lex` is in the range -25 to -1 if it was originally in the range 1 to 51, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3.**
