To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes the input and modifies the variables. The loop runs `cases` times, and for each iteration, it processes an integer `lex` and outputs three characters based on the value of `lex`.

Here's a breakdown of what happens in each iteration:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `arr` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `lex` is read from the input.

2. **Processing `lex`**:
   - The loop runs twice (for `j` in range(2)):
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the inner loop, `lex` is appended to `arr`.

3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - `arr` is sorted.
   - The first three elements of `arr` are converted to characters (by adding 96 to each element) and printed.

4. **Loop Completion**:
   - The loop runs `cases` times, processing each `lex` value independently.

After all iterations, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 100).
- `cases` remains unchanged (it specifies the number of iterations).
- `i` will be equal to `cases` (since it increments from 0 to `cases-1`).
- `n` remains unchanged (3 <= n <= 78, but it is not used in the loop body).
- `arr` will be the final sorted list from the last iteration.
- `lex` will be the final value after processing in the last iteration.
- `j` will be 2 (since the inner loop runs twice).
- `k` will be 3 (since the outer loop in the print statement runs three times).

The output state after all executions of the loop is described by the final values of these variables. Here is the output state in the specified format:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, cases is an integer specifying the number of iterations, i is equal to cases, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, arr is the sorted list from the last iteration, lex is the final value after processing in the last iteration, j is 2, k is 3.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations, the variable `t` remains within its initial range, `cases` remains the same, `i` equals the number of iterations, `n` remains within its initial range, `arr` holds the final sorted list from the last iteration, `lex` holds the final value after processing in the last iteration, `j` is 2 because the inner loop runs twice, and `k` is 3 because the print loop runs three times.
