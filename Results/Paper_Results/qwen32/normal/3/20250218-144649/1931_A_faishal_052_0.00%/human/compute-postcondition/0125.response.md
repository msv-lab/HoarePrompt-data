The `arr.sort()` operation will sort the list `arr` in ascending order. Given the possible initial states of `arr` as `[1, 1, lex]`, `[26, 1, lex]`, or `[26, 26, lex]`, we will consider how each of these lists changes upon sorting.

1. If `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`:
   - Sorting this list will result in `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - If `lex` is less than 1, the sorted list will be `[lex, 1, 1]`.

2. If `arr` is `[26, 1, lex]`:
   - Sorting this list will result in `[1, lex, 26]` if `lex` is between 1 and 26.
   - If `lex` is less than 1, the sorted list will be `[lex, 1, 26]`.
   - If `lex` is greater than 26, the sorted list will be `[1, 26, lex]`.

3. If `arr` is `[26, 26, lex]`:
   - Sorting this list will result in `[lex, 26, 26]` if `lex` is less than 26.
   - If `lex` is 26 or greater, the sorted list will be `[26, 26, lex]`.

The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The variable `lex` is adjusted to be in the range -25 to 51, so we need to consider its possible values within this range.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 1, lex], [lex, 1, 1], [1, lex, 26], [lex, 1, 26], [1, 26, lex], [lex, 26, 26], or [26, 26, lex] depending on the value of `lex`, `lex` is adjusted to be in the range -25 to 51, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3.**
