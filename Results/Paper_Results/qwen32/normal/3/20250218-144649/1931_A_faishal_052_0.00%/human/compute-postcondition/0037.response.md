The `arr.sort()` operation sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Given the initial state of `arr`, we need to consider the possible values of `lex` to determine the sorted order of `arr`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios for `lex`:
1. If `lex` is initially between 1 and 25:
   - The first element of `arr` is 1.
   - The second element of `arr` is 1.
   - The third element of `arr` is `lex` (0 to 25).

   In this case, after sorting, `arr` will be `[1, 1, lex]`.

2. If `lex` is initially between 26 and 51:
   - The first element of `arr` is 26.
   - The second element of `arr` is 26.
   - The third element of `arr` is `lex - 26` (between -25 and 25).

   In this case, after sorting, `arr` will be `[lex - 26, 26, 26]`.

3. If `lex` is initially greater than 51:
   - The first element of `arr` is 26.
   - The second element of `arr` is 26.
   - The third element of `arr` is `lex` (greater than 51).

   In this case, after sorting, `arr` will be `[26, 26, lex]`.

The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, `n`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is sorted based on the initial value of `lex` (either `[1, 1, lex]` if lex is between 1 and 25, `[lex - 26, 26, 26]` if lex is between 26 and 51, or `[26, 26, lex]` if lex is greater than 51), `lex` is modified to be between 0 and 25 if it was initially between 1 and 51, between -25 and 25 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or greater than 51 if it was initially greater than 51, `j` is 1.**
