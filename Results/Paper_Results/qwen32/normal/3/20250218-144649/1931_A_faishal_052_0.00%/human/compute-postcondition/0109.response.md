Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `arr` is either [1, 26] or [26, 26], `lex` is adjusted to be in the range 0 < `lex` < 26 if it was originally less than 52, or `lex - 52` if it was 52 or greater, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is adjusted by subtracting 26 from its original value. If `lex` was originally less than 52, it is already in the range 0 < `lex` < 26, and subtracting 26 would place it in the range -26 < `lex` < 26, but since it was initially less than 52, it remains in the valid range after adjustment. If `lex` was 52 or greater, it was initially adjusted to `lex - 26` (making it 26 or greater), and subtracting another 26 places it in the range 0 < `lex` < 26. The other variables remain unchanged.
