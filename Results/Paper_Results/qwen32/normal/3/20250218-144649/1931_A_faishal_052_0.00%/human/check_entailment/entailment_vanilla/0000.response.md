Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the encoded value of the word.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice (for the first two letters of the word).
   - Inside the loop, the program checks if `lex` (which is the encoded value) is less than or equal to 26:
     - If true, it appends `1` to `arr` and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52 but greater than 26, it appends `26` to `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is 52 or greater, it also appends `26` to `arr` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts the list `arr` to ensure the letters are in lexicographical order.
   - It then prints the corresponding characters for the values in `arr` by converting each value to a character using `chr(value + 96)` and printing them without a newline.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The program aims to construct the lexicographically smallest word that could have produced the encoded value.
   - However, the logic for distributing the encoded value among the three letters is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles values of `lex` that are less than 52 by always appending `1` or `26` without considering the optimal distribution of the remaining value.
   - For example, if `lex` is `24`, the program will append `1` twice and then `22`, resulting in the word "aav". This is correct in this case, but for other values, the logic may not produce the lexicographically smallest word.
   - Additionally, the program does not handle cases where the remaining value after the first two letters is greater than 26 correctly. It should ensure that the remaining value is distributed in a way that results in the smallest possible third letter.

Given these issues, the program does not always produce the correct lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `lex`.

Correctness: **False**
