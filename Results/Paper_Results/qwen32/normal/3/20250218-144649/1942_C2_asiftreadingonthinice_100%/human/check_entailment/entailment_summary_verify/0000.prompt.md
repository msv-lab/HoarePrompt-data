You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

        print(min(ans, n - 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` which represents a computed result based on the input parameters and list, ensuring that the final output does not exceed `n - 2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
After carefully reviewing the provided Python program and the problem description, I have identified several issues that suggest the program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Here are the reasons why the program may be incorrect:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the vertices chosen by Bessie are not optimally placed to maximize the number of triangles. For example, if the vertices are chosen in such a way that they do not allow for the maximum number of triangles to be formed, the program might not correctly identify the optimal solution.

2. **Logic in Triangle Counting**: The logic for counting triangles seems flawed. The program adds `x + y - 2` to the answer, which assumes that every additional vertex can form a triangle with the existing vertices. However, this is not always true, especially if the vertices are not optimally placed.

3. **Sorting and Pairing**: The program sorts the vertices and then pairs them to form triangles, but it does not consider the optimal way to form triangles with the additional vertices. The logic for handling the gaps between vertices and adding additional vertices to form triangles is not robust enough.

4. **Final Adjustment**: The final adjustment `ans += y` might not be correct in all cases. It assumes that any remaining vertices can form additional triangles, which is not always true.

Here is an example that demonstrates the program's incorrectness:

**Test Case:**
```
1
6 3 2
1 3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation:**
- Bessie has chosen vertices 1, 3, and 5.
- You can choose 2 more vertices to maximize the number of triangles.
- By choosing vertices 2 and 4, you can form 5 triangles: (1, 2, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 3, 5), (2, 3, 4), and (3, 4, 5).

**Program Output:**
The program will likely output a different number, such as 4, because it does not correctly handle the optimal placement of the additional vertices.

**Conclusion:**

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and does not always produce the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake.

Correctness: **False**.
