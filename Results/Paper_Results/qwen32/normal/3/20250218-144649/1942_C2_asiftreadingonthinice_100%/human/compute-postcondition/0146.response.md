Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer minus (`i - 1`) if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `ans` is calculated based on the initial conditions plus `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
