Postcondition: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer where if `y` was originally greater than or equal to `i - 1`, it is updated to `y - (i - 1)`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, `ans` is recalculated based on the new value of `i` and is equal to `ans` + `i` if `y` was originally greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one element.**
