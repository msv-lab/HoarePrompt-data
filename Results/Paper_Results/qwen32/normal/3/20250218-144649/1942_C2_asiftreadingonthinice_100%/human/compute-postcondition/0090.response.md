Output State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list, `y` is `y - (i - 1)`, `ans` is increased by `i`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is updated to be `y - (i - 1)`. The value of `ans` is increased by `i`, but since `ans` was already described as being increased by `i` in the initial state, we do not need to specify this change again. The list `tmp` remains unchanged.
