Postcondition: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `ii` is 1; `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is the last element in `tmp` that was processed or the first element that caused the loop to break; `ans` is `x + y - 2`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, `tmp` is a list containing `[(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2]`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty list.**
