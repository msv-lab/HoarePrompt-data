The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `tmp`. This action does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `ii` is 1; `a` is the newly provided sorted list of integers; `i` is the last element in `tmp` that was processed or the first element that caused the loop to break; `ans` is `x + y - 2`; `tmp` is an empty list.**
