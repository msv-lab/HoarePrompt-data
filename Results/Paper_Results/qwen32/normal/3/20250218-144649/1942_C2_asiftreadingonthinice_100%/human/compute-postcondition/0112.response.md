The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `tmp`. None of the other variables (`ans`, `y`, `ii`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, `a`) are modified in this snippet. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `tmp` is an empty list.**
