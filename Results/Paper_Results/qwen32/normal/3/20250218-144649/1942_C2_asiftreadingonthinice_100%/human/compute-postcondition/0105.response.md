Output State: **`ans` is Initial `ans` + sum(tmp) + Initial `y` - sum(i - 1 for i in tmp); `y` is Initial `y` - sum(i - 1 for i in tmp)**

Natural language: The value of `ans` is updated to be the sum of its initial value, the sum of elements in `tmp`, and the initial value of `y` minus the sum of `i - 1` for each `i` in `tmp`. The value of `y` remains as its initial value minus the sum of `i - 1` for each `i` in `tmp`.
