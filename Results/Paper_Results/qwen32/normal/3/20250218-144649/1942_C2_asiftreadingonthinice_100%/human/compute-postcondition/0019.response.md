Postcondition: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`; `ii` is 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input and has at least 2 elements; `i` is 2. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is `x + y` and `tmp` is an empty list. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] != 2` and `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0`, then `ans` is `x + y - 1` and `tmp` is a list containing the element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2` and `tmp` is an empty list.**
