The given code snippet simply increments the value of `ans` by 1. None of the other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `ans` will be its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`tt` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 * 10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `y` ≤ `n` - `x`; `ii` is 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input and has at least 2 elements; `i` is 3; `ans` is its previous value plus 1; `tmp` is unchanged.**
