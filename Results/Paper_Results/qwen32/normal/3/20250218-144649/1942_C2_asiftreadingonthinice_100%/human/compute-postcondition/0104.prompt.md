Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times a difference of 2 was found between consecutive elements in `a`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ans` is instead `x + y - 1`. `tmp` is a sorted list of half the even differences (excluding 2) between consecutive elements in `a`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, then `tmp` includes `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2 in the else part.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tmp` is a non-empty list. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)` and `ans` is increased by `i`. Otherwise, `y` is less than `i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tmp` is a non-empty list with at least one more element after the current `i`, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by `i` and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tmp` is a non-empty list with at least one more element after the current `i`, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is increased by the value of `i` and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
