Postcondition: **`ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y` is an input integer, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `tt` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2. If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even, `tmp` is a list containing the element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty list.**
