To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the variables involved:

1. `k` and `q` remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop.
2. `p` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
3. `qs` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop; it only serves as the iterable for the loop.
4. `n` changes with each iteration, taking the value of the next element in `qs`.
5. `res` accumulates the results of `func_1(n, p)` with each iteration.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs` up to the third element. Therefore, after all iterations, `res` will contain the result of `func_1(n, p)` for every element `n` in `qs`.

The final output state after all the iterations of the loop will be:

- `k` remains the first integer from the input.
- `q` remains the second integer from the input.
- `n` will be the last element in `qs` after the loop finishes.
- `p` remains the list of integers read from the input.
- `qs` remains the new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `res` will be a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.

Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the last element in the new `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `res` will contain the results of applying `func_1` to each element of `qs`, and all other variables will retain their initial values except for `n`, which will be the last element of `qs`.
