Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the last element in the new `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element in `qs`, `t` is at least 1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `k` and `q` remain unchanged as they were initially. The variable `n` will be the last element of `qs`. The list `p` remains as it was initially read from the input. The list `qs` also remains unchanged, and `res` will contain the results of applying `func_1` to each element of `qs` in sequence. The variable `t` remains at least 1, as it was initially.
