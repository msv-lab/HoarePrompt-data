The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since `res` already contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` from the initial state, after the execution, `res` will have two identical elements, both being the result of `func_1(n, p)`. The other variables (`k`, `q`, `n`, `p`, and `qs`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the next element in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` must have at least one more element, `res` is a list containing two identical elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.
