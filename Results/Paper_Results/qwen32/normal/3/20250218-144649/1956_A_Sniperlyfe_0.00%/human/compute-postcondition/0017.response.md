The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k` and `q`. This overwrites the previous values of `k` and `q` with the new input values. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `qs`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing as many elements as there are in `qs`, with each element being the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.**
