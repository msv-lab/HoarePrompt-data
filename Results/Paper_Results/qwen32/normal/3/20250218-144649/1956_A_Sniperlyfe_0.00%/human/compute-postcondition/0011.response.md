Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is the next element in `qs`. Since `qs` is a list of integers and must contain at least one element, `n` is the first element of `qs`.
2. `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round.
3. `k` and `q` are the first and second input integers, respectively.
4. `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element.
5. `res` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Analysis:
- `res` is a list with two elements, both of which are the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
- The `map(str, res)` function converts each element in `res` to a string.
- The `' '.join(...)` function joins these string elements with a space in between.

### Output Calculation:
- Since `res` contains two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`, let's denote the result of `func_1(n, p)` as `result`.
- Therefore, `res` can be represented as `[result, result]`.
- When we convert each element to a string and join them with a space, the output will be `result result`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact value of `result` (which is the output of `func_1(n, p)`) is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `result`.

Output: **result result (where result is the output of `func_1(n, p)`)**
