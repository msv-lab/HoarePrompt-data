The code provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k` and `q`. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `qs`, `res`, `t`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the last element in the new `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, `t` is at least 1.**

In simple terms, `k` and `q` have been updated to the first and second integers from the input, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
