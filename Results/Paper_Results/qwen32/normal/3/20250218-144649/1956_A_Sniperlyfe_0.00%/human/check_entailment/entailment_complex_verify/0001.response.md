### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotations and the problem description.

#### Function 1: `func_1(n, p)`

**Functionality:**
- The function aims to simulate the process of removing players from positions specified in `p` until no more players can be removed.
- It repeatedly subtracts the count of positions in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` until `n` is less than the smallest value in `p`.

**Annotation Analysis:**
- **State Before Function Call:** `n` is the initial number of players, and `p` is a list of positions to be kicked out.
- **While Loop Condition:** `n >= min(p)`. This ensures that the loop continues as long as there are players to be removed.
- **Sum Calculation:** `sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))` counts the number of positions in `p` that are within the current player count `n`.
- **State After Loop:** The loop exits when `n` is less than the smallest value in `p`, ensuring no more players can be removed.
- **Return Value:** The final value of `n` is returned, which represents the number of remaining players.

**Verification:**
- The logic correctly simulates the removal process by decrementing `n` by the count of valid positions in `p` in each iteration.
- The loop exits when no more valid positions exist, ensuring the final `n` is the correct number of remaining players.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`

**Functionality:**
- This function handles input and output for multiple test cases.
- It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the sequence `p` and the list of player counts `qs`.
- For each player count `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and prints the result.

**Annotation Analysis:**
- **Input Reading:** The function reads `t` (number of test cases), then for each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list `qs`.
- **Processing Each Test Case:** For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
- **Output:** It prints the results for each test case.

**Verification:**
- The function correctly processes multiple test cases.
- It reads and processes the input as specified.
- It calls `func_1` for each player count and prints the results.

**Simulation:**

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `k = 2`, `q = 1`
   - `p = [3, 5]`
   - `qs = [5]`
   - **Simulation:**
     - Initial players: `ABCDE`
     - Round 1: Remove players at positions 3 and 5 (`C` and `E`), remaining: `ABD`
     - Round 2: Remove player at position 3 (`D`), remaining: `AB`
     - No more players can be removed.
   - **Result:** 2 players remain.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `k = 5`, `q = 3`
   - `p = [2, 4, 6, 7, 9]`
   - `qs = [1, 3, 5]`
   - **Simulation:**
     - For `n = 1`: No players can be removed.
     - For `n = 3`: Remove player at position 2 (`B`), remaining: `AC`
     - For `n = 5`: Remove players at positions 2 and 4 (`B` and `D`), remaining: `ACE`
   - **Result:** 1, 1, 1 players remain.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `k = 5`, `q = 4`
   - `p = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
   - `qs = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - **Simulation:**
     - For `n = 1`: No players can be removed.
     - For `n = 2`: No players can be removed.
     - For `n = 3`: Remove player at position 3 (`C`), remaining: `AB`
     - For `n = 4`: Remove player at position 3 (`C`), remaining: `ABD`
   - **Result:** 1, 2, 2, 2 players remain.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - `k = 2`, `q = 3`
   - `p = [69, 96]`
   - `qs = [1, 10, 100]`
   - **Simulation:**
     - For `n = 1`: No players can be removed.
     - For `n = 10`: No players can be removed.
     - For `n = 100`: Remove players at positions 69 and 96 (`G` and `Y`), remaining: `1-68` and `97-100`
   - **Result:** 1, 10, 68 players remain.

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - `k = 1`, `q = 1`
   - `p = [100]`
   - `qs = [100]`
   - **Simulation:**
     - For `n = 100`: Remove player at position 100 (`Z`), remaining: `1-99`
   - **Result:** 50 players remain.

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - `k = 3`, `q = 3`
   - `p = [10, 20, 30]`
   - `qs = [1, 10, 100]`
   - **Simulation:**
     - For `n = 1`: No players can be removed.
     - For `n = 10`: Remove player at position 10 (`J`), remaining: `1-9`
     - For `n = 100`: Remove players at positions 10, 20, and 30 (`J`, `T`, `Y`), remaining: `1-9`, `11-19`, `21-29`, `31-100`
   - **Result:** 1, 9, 9 players remain.

#### Conclusion

The program correctly simulates the game by repeatedly removing players from specified positions until no more players can be removed. It handles multiple test cases and computes the number of remaining players for each initial number of players as specified in the problem description.
