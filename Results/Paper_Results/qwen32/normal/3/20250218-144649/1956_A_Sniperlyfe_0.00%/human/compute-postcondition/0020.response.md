The code snippet provided resets the `res` list to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the `res` list, which was previously containing results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the new `qs`, is now empty.

Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the last element in the new `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is an empty list.**
