To determine the output, we need to break down the components involved in the `print` statement:

1. **`res`**: This is a list containing one element, which is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the element in `res`. However, we know that `res` is a list with one element, and this element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

2. **`map(str, res)`**: This will convert each element of the list `res` to a string. Since `res` contains one element, the result of `map(str, res)` will be an iterable containing one string element.

3. **`' '.join(...)`**: This will join the elements of the iterable produced by `map(str, res)` into a single string, with each element separated by a space. Since there is only one element in `res`, the resulting string will simply be that element converted to a string.

Given the information, the `print` statement will output the string representation of the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output: **[result of func_1(n, p)] (where [result of func_1(n, p)] is the string representation of the result of the function `func_1` called with `n` and `p` as arguments)**
