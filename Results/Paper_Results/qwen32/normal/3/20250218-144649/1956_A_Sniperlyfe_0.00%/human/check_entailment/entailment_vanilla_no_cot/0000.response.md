Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Output Format**: The `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` statement is inside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`. This means the output is printed after processing each `n`, not after processing all `n` for the current test case. The output should be printed once after all `n` values for the current test case have been processed.

2. **Logic Error in `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` is incorrect. It attempts to simulate the game by reducing `n` by the number of players kicked out in each round. However, the logic does not correctly handle the case where players are skipped because there are fewer players left than the position specified in `p`. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the game rounds as described in the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, p):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        kicked_out = set()
        for position in p:
            if position - 1 < len(players):
                kicked_out.add(players[position - 1])
        if not kicked_out:
            break
        players = [player for player in players if player not in kicked_out]
    return len(players)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

In this corrected version:
- `func_1` now correctly simulates the game by maintaining a list of players and removing the players at the specified positions in each round.
- The output for each test case is printed only once after processing all `n` values for that test case.
