The code snippet `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and then converts each of those strings into an integer. This means that `qs` will now hold the new list of integers obtained from the input, replacing its previous value.

Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `q` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the last element in the new `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, `t` is at least 1.**

In human-readable terms: The variable `qs` has been updated to a new list of integers read from the input. All other variables retain their previous values.
