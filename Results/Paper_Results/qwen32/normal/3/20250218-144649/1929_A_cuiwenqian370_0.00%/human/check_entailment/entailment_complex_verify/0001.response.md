Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the original assessment based on the provided annotations and the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array. One effective way to achieve this is to alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements after sorting the array.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows this strategy:
1. It sorts the array.
2. It alternates between the largest and smallest remaining elements to form a new array.
3. It calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.

Let's review the key parts of the program with the annotations:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   ```python
   arr.sort()
   ```
   This step ensures that we can easily access the smallest and largest elements.

2. **Forming the New Array**:
   ```python
   new_arr = []
   left = 0
   right = n - 1
   while left <= right:
       if left == right:
           new_arr.append(arr[left])
       else:
           new_arr.append(arr[right])
           new_arr.append(arr[left])
       left += 1
       right -= 1
   ```
   This loop alternates between appending the largest and smallest remaining elements to `new_arr`. The annotations confirm that `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` in a new order: the largest element, the smallest element, the second largest element, the second smallest element, and so on.

3. **Calculating the Beauty**:
   ```python
   max_beauty = 0
   for i in range(1, n):
       max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
   return max_beauty
   ```
   This loop calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

### Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided example cases:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `3 2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - New Array: `[3, 1, 2]` (This is incorrect; it should be `[1, 3, 2]` to maximize beauty)
   - Beauty: `(3-1) + (2-1) = 2 + 1 = 3` (Note: The correct arrangement would be `[1, 3, 2]` giving `(3-1) + (2-3) = 2`)
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program incorrectly outputs `3` by rearranging to `[3, 1, 2]` and calculating the beauty.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `3 69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - New Array: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Beauty: `(69-69) + (69-69) = 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program correctly outputs `0`.

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5 100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - New Array: `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]` (This is incorrect; it should be `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]` to maximize beauty)
   - Beauty: `(100-43) + (90-43) + (54-43) + (80-54) = 57 + 47 + 11 + 26 = 141` (Note: The correct arrangement would be `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]` giving `57`)
   - Expected Output: `57`
   - The program incorrectly outputs `141` by rearranging to `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]` and calculating the beauty.

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `4 3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - New Array: `[4, 3, 3, 3]`
   - Beauty: `(4-3) + (3-3) + (3-3) = 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `2 2 1`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
   - New Array: `[2, 1]`
   - Beauty: `(2-1) = 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.

### Conclusion
The program does not always correctly implement the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array. Specifically, the arrangement of the new array in the first and third test cases is incorrect, leading to incorrect beauty calculations.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
