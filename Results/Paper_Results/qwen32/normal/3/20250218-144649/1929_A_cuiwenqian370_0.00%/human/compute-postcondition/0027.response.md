To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all the iterations, we need to understand how the loop operates. The loop continues to run as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`. In each iteration, the loop appends elements from `arr` to `new_arr` in a specific order: it appends the largest remaining element (pointed to by `right`) and the smallest remaining element (pointed to by `left`), then increments `left` and decrements `right`. If `left` equals `right`, it appends the single remaining element.

The loop will terminate when `left` exceeds `right`, meaning all elements have been processed and added to `new_arr`.

**Output State:**
- `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` in a new order: the largest element, the smallest element, the second largest element, the second smallest element, and so on.
- `left` will be greater than `right`, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
- `right` will be one less than `left`.

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, `new_arr` will have the elements of `arr` rearranged such that they alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements. The variables `left` and `right` will no longer satisfy the condition `left <= right`, meaning `left` will be greater than `right`.

Output State: **`new_arr` contains elements of `arr` in the order: largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, ..., and `left` is greater than `right`.**
