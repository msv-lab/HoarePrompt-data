The provided Python code snippet only includes the initialization of `max_beauty` to 0. It does not affect any of the other variables (`new_arr`, `left`, `right`) mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `new_arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` in a new order: the largest element, the smallest element, the second largest element, the second smallest element, and so on; `left` will be greater than `right`, indicating that the loop has finished executing; `right` will be one less than `left`; `max_beauty` is 0.**

In natural language, after the execution of the given code snippet, `new_arr` still holds the rearranged elements of `arr` in the specified order, `left` is still greater than `right`, `right` is still one less than `left`, and `max_beauty` has been initialized to 0.
