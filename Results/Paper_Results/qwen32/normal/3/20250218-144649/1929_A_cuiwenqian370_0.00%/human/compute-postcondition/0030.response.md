The code snippet provided updates the `max_beauty` variable by adding the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in the `new_arr` array. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the absolute difference between `new_arr[1]` and `new_arr[0]` will be calculated and added to `max_beauty`.

Since `new_arr` is ordered such that the largest element comes first, followed by the smallest, then the second largest, and so on, `new_arr[0]` is the largest element, and `new_arr[1]` is the smallest element. Therefore, `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0])` will be the difference between the largest and smallest elements in `new_arr`.

The values of `left`, `right`, `n`, and the ordering of `new_arr` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `max_beauty`.

Output State: **`new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` in a new order: the largest element, the smallest element, the second largest element, the second smallest element, and so on; `left` and `right` are not yet compared, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_beauty` is `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0])`**.
