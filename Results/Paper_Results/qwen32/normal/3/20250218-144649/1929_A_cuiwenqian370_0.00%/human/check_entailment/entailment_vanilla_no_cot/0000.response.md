To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array `a` after rearranging its elements.

### Problem Analysis

The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements:
\[ \text{beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}| \]

To maximize this beauty, we should try to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements. One effective strategy is to alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This strategy maximizes the absolute differences because the largest and smallest elements will have the maximum possible difference.

### Program Analysis

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array is sorted in ascending order.
   - This is a good first step because it allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements.

2. **Rearranging the Array:**
   - The program uses a two-pointer approach to rearrange the array: one pointer starts at the beginning (`left`), and the other starts at the end (`right`).
   - Elements are alternately selected from the end and the beginning of the sorted array.
   - This alternation is intended to create the maximum possible absolute differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Calculating the Beauty:**
   - After rearranging the array, the program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

### Testing the Program

Let's verify the program with the provided example cases.

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
   - Sorted Array: `1 2 3`
   - Rearranged Array: `3 1 2` (or `3 2 1` or `1 3 2` or `2 3 1`, but the maximum beauty is obtained with `3 1 2`)
   - Beauty: \(|3-1| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3\) (Note: The correct rearrangement for maximum beauty is `1 3 2` which gives \(|3-1| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3\), but the given program's rearrangement `3 1 2` gives \(|3-1| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\). However, the correct answer should be `2` which is obtained by `1 3 2` or `2 1 3` or `3 2 1` or `2 3 1` which gives `|3-1| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3` or `|2-1| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2`)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
   - Sorted Array: `69 69 69`
   - Rearranged Array: `69 69 69`
   - Beauty: \(|69-69| + |69-69| = 0\)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted Array: `43 54 80 90 100`
   - Rearranged Array: `100 43 90 54 80` (or any other rearrangement that maximizes differences)
   - Beauty: \(|100-43| + |90-54| + |80-90| = 57 + 36 + 10 = 103\) (Note: The correct rearrangement for maximum beauty is `43 100 54 90 80` which gives \(|100-43| + |54-100| + |90-54| + |80-90| = 57 + 46 + 36 + 10 = 159\), but the given program's rearrangement `100 43 90 54 80` gives \(|100-43| + |90-43| + |54-90| + |80-54| = 57 + 47 + 36 + 26 = 166\). However, the correct answer should be `57` which is obtained by `43 100 54 90 80` or `100 43 90 54 80` which gives `|100-43| + |54-100| + |90-54| + |80-90| = 57 + 46 + 36 + 10 = 159` or `|100-43| + |90-43| + |54-90| + |80-54| = 57 + 47 + 36 + 26 = 166`)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted Array: `3 3 3 4`
   - Rearranged Array: `4 3 3 3` (or any other rearrangement that maximizes differences)
   - Beauty: \(|4-3| + |3-3| + |3-3| = 1\)

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `2`, `2 1`
   - Sorted Array: `1 2`
   - Rearranged Array: `2 1`
   - Beauty: \(|2-1| = 1\)

The program does not always produce the correct maximum beauty. For example, in the third test case, the program does not produce the maximum beauty of 57.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not always produce the maximum beauty of the array after rearranging its elements.

Correctness: **False**
