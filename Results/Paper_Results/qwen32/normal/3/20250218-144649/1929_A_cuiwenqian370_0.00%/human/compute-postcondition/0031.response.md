The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `new_arr`, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty`, and `arr` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` in a new order: the largest element, the smallest element, the second largest element, the second smallest element, and so on; `left` and `right` are not yet compared, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `max_beauty` is `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0])`**
