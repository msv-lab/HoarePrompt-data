The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those for the loop to execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop will execute because the range function will generate at least one value for `i` (starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`).

Before the loop starts, the state indicates that `left` will be greater than `right`, which suggests that the loop has already finished executing. However, we need to adjust the state so that the loop can start executing. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop runs at least once. The initial value of `i` should be 1, as specified in the range function.

The states of `new_arr`, `left`, `right`, and `max_beauty` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

State: **`new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` in a new order: the largest element, the smallest element, the second largest element, the second smallest element, and so on; `left` and `right` are not yet compared, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `max_beauty` is 0**
