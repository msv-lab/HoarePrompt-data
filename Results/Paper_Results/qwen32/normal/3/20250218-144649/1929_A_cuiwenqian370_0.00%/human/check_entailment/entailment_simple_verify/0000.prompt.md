You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of arr is equal to n.

    #The program returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in `new_arr` from `new_arr[0]` to `new_arr[n-1]`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Maximize the beauty of the array `a`, defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from `2` to `n`.
- **Input**: 
  - First line: An integer `t` (number of test cases).
  - For each test case:
    - First line: An integer `n` (length of the array).
    - Second line: `n` integers representing the array `a`.
- **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum beauty of the array `a` that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case separately.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the array `arr`.
3. **Rearranging**: It rearranges the sorted array in an alternating high-low manner (largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, etc.).
4. **Beauty Calculation**: It calculates the beauty of the rearranged array by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
5. **Output**: It prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Verification:
Let's examine the logic and correctness of the code:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the array is a good start since it allows us to easily pick the largest and smallest elements.
- **Alternating Rearrangement**: The code alternates between the largest and smallest elements, which helps in maximizing the absolute differences.
- **Beauty Calculation**: The code correctly calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

### Testing with Examples:
Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
Input:
```
3
2 1 3
```
Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
Rearranged: `[3, 1, 2]`
Beauty: `|3-1| + |1-2| = 2`

#### Example 2:
Input:
```
3
69 69 69
```
Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
Rearranged: `[69, 69, 69]`
Beauty: `|69-69| + |69-69| = 0`

#### Example 3:
Input:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
Rearranged: `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`
Beauty: `|100-43| + |43-90| + |90-54| + |54-80| = 57`

#### Example 4:
Input:
```
4
3 4 3 3
```
Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
Rearranged: `[4, 3, 3, 3]`
Beauty: `|4-3| + |3-3| + |3-3| = 1`

#### Example 5:
Input:
```
2
1
```
Sorted: `[1, 2]`
Rearranged: `[2, 1]`
Beauty: `|2-1| = 1`

All the provided examples match the expected output, indicating that the program is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and testing, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array for all provided test cases and edge cases considered.

Correctness: **True**.
