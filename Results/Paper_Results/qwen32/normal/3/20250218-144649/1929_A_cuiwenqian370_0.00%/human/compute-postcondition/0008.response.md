Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`; `new_arr` is a list containing the largest element of `arr`; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`; `left` is not equal to `right`**

Explanation: The largest element of `arr` (which is `arr[right]`) has been appended to `new_arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
