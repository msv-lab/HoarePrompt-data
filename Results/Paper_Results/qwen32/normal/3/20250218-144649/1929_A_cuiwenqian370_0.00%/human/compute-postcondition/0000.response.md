The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the precondition that each integer `a_i` in `arr` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` is still valid. The only change is that the order of elements in `arr` is now sorted.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `arr` is a sorted list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`.**
