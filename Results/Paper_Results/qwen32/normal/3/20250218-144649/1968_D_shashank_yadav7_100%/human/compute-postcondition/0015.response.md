Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` was true, otherwise `k` remains `k - 1`, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`. If `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
