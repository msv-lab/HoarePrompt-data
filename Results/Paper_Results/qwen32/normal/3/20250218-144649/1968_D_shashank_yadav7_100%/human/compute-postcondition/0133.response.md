The code snippet `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. 

Given the initial state, `bp` is initially `2 * a[b]`. After the execution of `bp += a[b]`, the new value of `bp` will be `2 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[b]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `bp` is `3 * a[b]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is either -1 or the second integer read from the input minus 2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[previous_s] - 1] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp, a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the next part of the code.**
