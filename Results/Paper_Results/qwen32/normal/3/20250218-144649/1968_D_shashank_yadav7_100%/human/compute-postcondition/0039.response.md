The code snippet provided updates the variable `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. Given the initial state, `sm` was already defined as `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, so the value of `sm` will not change unless `a[s] * k + sp` is greater than the current `sm`.

Since the value of `sm` is being recalculated using the same formula, and no other variables affecting this calculation are being modified in the provided code snippet, the value of `sm` remains as it was initially defined.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**.
