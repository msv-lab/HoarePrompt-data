The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state description provides a detailed explanation of the variables and their values, but it does not indicate any condition or logic that would alter the output of this specific `print` statement. The `print('Draw')` statement is straightforward and will always output the string `'Draw'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an input integer with a range from 1 to 10^4.
2. The variable `n` is the first integer read from the input.
3. The variable `k` is either 0 or the second integer read from the input minus `n`.
4. The variables `b` and `s` are results of iterative operations based on the list `p` and the number of iterations `n` or until `k` reaches 0.
5. The variables `sp` and `bp` are sums of values from the list `a` based on the iterative operations.
6. The variables `bm` and `sm` are maximum values encountered during the iterations.
7. The list `p` contains integers read from the input.
8. The list `a` contains integers read from the input.
9. The variable `i` represents the number of iterations the loop ran.
10. The condition `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm` is mentioned but does not affect the `print('Draw')` statement.

Since the `print('Draw')` statement is not dependent on any of the variables or conditions described, it will always output the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
