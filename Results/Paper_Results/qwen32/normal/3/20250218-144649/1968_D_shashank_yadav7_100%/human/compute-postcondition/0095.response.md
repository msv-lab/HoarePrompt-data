Let's analyze the provided initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **t**: An input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **n**: Greater than 0.
3. **k**: Initially 0.
4. **b**: The final value of `b` after all iterations minus 1.
5. **s**: The final value of `s` after all iterations minus 1.
6. **sp**: The sum of `a[s]` for each iteration.
7. **bp**: The sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.
8. **bm**: The maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` across all iterations.
9. **sm**: The maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` across all iterations.
10. **p**: A list of integers read from the input.
11. **a**: A list of integers read from the input.
12. **i**: `n` if the loop completes all iterations or the point where `k` becomes 0.
13. **bm > sm**: Indicates that `bm` is greater than `sm`.

### Key Observations

- The variable `k` starts at 0 and does not change its value based on the given initial state.
- The print statement is `print('Bodya')`, which is a simple string output.
- The values of `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are all dependent on the iterations of a loop, but they do not affect the print statement directly.
- The print statement does not use any of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`, `p`, `a`, or `i`.

### Conclusion

The print statement `print('Bodya')` will print the string "Bodya" regardless of the values of the other variables. The initial state does not influence the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **Bodya**
