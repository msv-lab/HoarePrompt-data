The code snippet `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Given the initial state, the value of `bp` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `k - 2`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is 2.**

In natural language, this means:
- `t` remains the same input integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `k` remains `k - 2`.
- `b` remains `p[b] - 1`.
- `s` remains `p[s] - 1`.
- `sp` remains `3 * a[s] + a[s]`.
- `bp` is now `bp + a[b]`.
- `bm` remains `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.
- `sm` remains `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.
- `p` remains the same list of integers read from the input.
- `a` remains the same list of integers read from the input.
- `i` remains 2.
