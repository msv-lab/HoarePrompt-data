The code snippet updates the value of `sm` by taking the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. Given the initial state, `sm` is already defined as `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp, a[s] * k + sp)`, which simplifies to `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, since `a[s] * k + sp` is repeated.

The new value of `sm` will be the maximum of these values:
- The current value of `sm`, which is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`
- `a[s] * k + sp`

Since `a[s] * k + sp` is one of the terms already considered in the current definition of `sm`, the value of `sm` will not change unless `a[s] * (k + 1)` is less than `a[s] * k + sp`, which is not possible given the initial definition of `sm`.

Therefore, the value of `sm` remains the same.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is either -2 or the second integer read from the input minus 3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[p[previous_s] - 1] - 1] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute the next part of the code.**
