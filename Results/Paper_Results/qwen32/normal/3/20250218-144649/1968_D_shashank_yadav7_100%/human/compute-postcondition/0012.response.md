Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is decremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
