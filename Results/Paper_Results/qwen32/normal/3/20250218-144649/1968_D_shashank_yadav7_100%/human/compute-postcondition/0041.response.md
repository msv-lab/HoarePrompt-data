The code snippet provided increments the variable `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Given the initial state, the value of `bp` is initially `3 * a[b]`. After the increment, the new value of `bp` will be `3 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `4 * a[b]`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `4 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**.
