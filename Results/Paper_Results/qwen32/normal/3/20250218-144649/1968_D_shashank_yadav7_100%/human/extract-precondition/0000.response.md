Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each testcase consists of four integers n, k, P_B, P_S where 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The next line contains n integers p_1, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n) representing the permutation p. The following line contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) representing the array a. The sum of all n across all testcases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
