Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is `k - 2`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `sp` is updated to `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `4 * a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
