### Reasoning:

The program provided is designed to simulate the described game between Bodya and Sasha. Here's a breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the permutation and array), `k` (number of turns), `b` (Bodya's starting position), and `s` (Sasha's starting position).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices**:
   - The positions `b` and `s` are adjusted to be zero-indexed for easier array access.

3. **Initial Scores**:
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]`, respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`) are initially set to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k`, respectively. This assumes that both players stay in their starting positions for all `k` turns.

4. **Simulation of Moves**:
   - The program iterates up to `k` times, simulating the moves of both players.
   - In each iteration, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - It updates the maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`) by considering the current scores plus the scores from staying at the current positions for the remaining turns.

5. **Comparison of Scores**:
   - After the simulation, the program compares the maximum possible scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if `bm` is greater than `sm`, "Sasha" if `sm` is greater than `bm`, or "Draw" if they are equal.

### Issues in the Program:

The main issue in the program lies in the logic of updating the maximum possible scores. The current implementation incorrectly updates `bm` and `sm` by considering the scores from staying at the current positions for the remaining turns, which is not the correct approach for determining the maximum possible scores.

### Correctness:

Given the incorrect logic for updating the maximum possible scores, the program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
