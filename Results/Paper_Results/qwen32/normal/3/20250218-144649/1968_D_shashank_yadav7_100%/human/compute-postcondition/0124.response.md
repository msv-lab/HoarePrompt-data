The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and `n` determines whether the loop can continue executing. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the next iteration of the loop to execute, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value of 0 to 1.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`, `p`, `a`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is either 0 or the second integer read from the input minus 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[previous_s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k + 1), a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(a[s] * (k + 1), a[s] * k + sp)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1**
