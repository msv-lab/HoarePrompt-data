Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second integer read from the input minus 1, `b` is the third integer read from the input minus 1, `s` is the fourth integer read from the input minus 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1)`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 0`**

In natural language: The value of `k` is decreased by 1. The values of `bm` and `sm` are recalculated based on the new value of `k`, which is now the original `k` minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
