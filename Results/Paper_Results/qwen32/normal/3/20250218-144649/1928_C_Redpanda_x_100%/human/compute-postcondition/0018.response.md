The value of `prime_to_i` is updated to 1. The values of `k`, `prime`, `primes`, `factors`, `rest` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)` with at least one more element, `prime_to_i` is 1.**
