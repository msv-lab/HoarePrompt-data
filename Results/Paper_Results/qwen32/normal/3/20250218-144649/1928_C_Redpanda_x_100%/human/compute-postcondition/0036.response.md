The code snippet `prime_to_i *= prime` multiplies the current value of `prime_to_i` by the value of `prime`. Given the initial state, `prime_to_i` is initially equal to `prime`. After the multiplication, `prime_to_i` becomes `prime * prime` or `prime^2`.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the `primes` list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)` with at least one more element, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime`, `factor` is the next element in the `rest` collection; a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**
