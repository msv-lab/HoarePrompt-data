Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `prime` is `primes[k]`, `primes` is a list of primes, `k` is not equal to the length of the primes list, `factors` is a dictionary with `prime` as a key and `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, `rest` is a non-empty collection returned by `generate(k + 1)`, `prime_to_i` is 1, a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been returned.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value `factor * prime_to_i` has been returned. All other variables retain their initial values.
