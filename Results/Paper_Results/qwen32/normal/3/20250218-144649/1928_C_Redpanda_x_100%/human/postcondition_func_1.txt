The function `generate` accepts a non-negative integer `k` and yields all possible values of the form `factor * prime^i` for each `factor` generated recursively from the next index, where `prime` is the `k`-th prime in the list `primes` and `i` ranges from 0 to `factors[prime]`. If `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list, it yields 1.
