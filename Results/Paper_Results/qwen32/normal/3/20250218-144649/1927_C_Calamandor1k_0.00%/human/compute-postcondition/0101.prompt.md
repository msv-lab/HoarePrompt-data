Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is `t + 1` such that `t` > 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `b` is a new list of integers read from input; `len_a` is the length of the list `a`; `len_b` is the length of the list `b`; `d` is `k // 2`; `count_a` is 0; `count_b` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
    if len_a > i + 1:
        if a[i] <= k:
            count_a += 1
    if len_b > i + 1:
        if b[i] <= k:
            count_b += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is `t + 1` such that `t` > 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element or `b` is a new list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element; `len_a` is the length of the list `a`; `len_b` is the length of the list `b`; `d` is `k // 2`. If the length of `a` is greater than `i + 1`, `count_a` is 1 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_a` is 0. If the length of `b` is greater than `i + 1`, `count_b` is 2 if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_b` is 0. If the length of `b` is not greater than `i + 1`, `count_b` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t + 1` such that `t > 0`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element or `b` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `len_a` is the length of the list `a`, `len_b` is the length of the list `b`, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `len_a > i + 1` and `a[i] <= k`, then `count_a` is `count_a + 1`. If `len_b > i + 1` and `b[i] <= k`, then `count_b` is `count_b + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t + 1` such that `t > 0`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element or `b` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `len_a` is the length of the list `a`, `len_b` is the length of the list `b`, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `len_a > i + 1` and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is `count_a + 1`. Otherwise, `count_a` remains unchanged. If `len_b > i + 1` and `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_b` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
