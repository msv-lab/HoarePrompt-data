The code snippet initializes two variables, `count_a` and `count_b`, to 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, and `len_b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `b` is a list of integers read from input; `len_a` is the length of list `a`; `len_b` is the length of list `b`; `count_a` is 0; `count_b` is 0.**
