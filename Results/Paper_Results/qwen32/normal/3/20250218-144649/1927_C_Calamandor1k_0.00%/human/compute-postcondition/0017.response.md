Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 1 element or `b` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 1 element; `len_a` is the length of list `a`; `len_b` is the length of list `b`; `d` is `k // 2`. If `len_a` is greater than `i + 1` and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is 1; otherwise, `count_a` remains 0. If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is 1; otherwise, `count_b` remains 0.**
