Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1` such that `t` >= 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `b` is a new list of integers read from input; `len_a` must be at least 1 or `len_b` must be at least 1; `d` is `k // 2`; `i` is `i + 1` such that `i` < `max(len_a, len_b)`. If `len_a > i + 1` and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is incremented by 1. If `len_b > i + 1` and `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is incremented by 1.**
