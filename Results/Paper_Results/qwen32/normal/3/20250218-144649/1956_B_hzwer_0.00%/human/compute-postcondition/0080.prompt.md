You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1()` is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of cards you and Nene each receive. The second line of each test case contains a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list at most 2 times. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: The `dp` table is fully populated, and `dp[0][0]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from the beginning of the `cards` list.
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from the beginning of the `cards` list, which is stored in `dp[0][0]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the number of cards, and a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive and appears at most twice. The function returns the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from the beginning of the `cards` list, which is stored in `dp[0][0]`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from the beginning of the `cards` list, which is stored in `dp[0][0]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
