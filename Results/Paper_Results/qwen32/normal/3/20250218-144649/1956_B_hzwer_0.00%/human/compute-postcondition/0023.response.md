The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. Given that `j` is 1 and does not change, the value at `dp[i][1]` is now the same as the value at `dp[i + 1][1]`. The values of `n`, `cards`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][1]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][1]`, `j` is 1.**
