The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum value between `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. The values of `n`, `cards`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is not specified in the code snippet, so we assume it is a valid index within the bounds of the `dp` list.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`, `j` is 1.**
