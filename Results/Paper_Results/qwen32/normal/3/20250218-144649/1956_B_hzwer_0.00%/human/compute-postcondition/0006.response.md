To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head is defined by the `for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):` statement, which involves the variable `j` and the variable `n`.

The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, meaning `n` must be at least 1. However, the given state specifies that `n` must be at least 2, which already satisfies the requirement for the loop to execute.

Given that `j` is initialized to `n - 1` and the loop decrements `j` until it reaches -1, we do not need to adjust `j` directly before the loop starts, as it is controlled by the range function.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as the provided condition `n` must be at least 2 already ensures that the loop will run. The other variables (`cards`, `dp`, and their initializations) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `cards` is a list of integers read from input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0, and `dp[n - 2][0]` is 0**.
