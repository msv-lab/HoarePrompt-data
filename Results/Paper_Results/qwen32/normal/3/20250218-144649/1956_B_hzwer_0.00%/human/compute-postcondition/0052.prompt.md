Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The final `dp` table after all iterations, where `dp[0][0]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected. All other elements of `dp` are updated based on the logic described in the loop. `i` is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
    elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `dp` table with `dp[0][j]` holding the value of `dp[1][j]` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0, otherwise `dp[0][j]` holds the maximum value between `dp[1][j]` and `dp[2][j - 1] + 1` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, or the maximum value between `dp[1][j]`, `dp[2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[1][j + 1]` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is greater than 1. `dp[0][0]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected, `i` remains 0, and `n` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `dp` table with `dp[0][j]` holding the value of `dp[1][j]` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0, otherwise `dp[0][j]` holds the maximum value between `dp[1][j]` and `dp[2][j - 1] + 1` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, or the maximum value between `dp[1][j]`, `dp[2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[1][j + 1]` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is greater than 1. Specifically, `dp[0][1]` is equal to `dp[1][1]` if the count of `2` in the `cards` list is 0, `max(dp[1][1], dp[2][0] + 1)` if the count of `2` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, or `max(dp[1][1], dp[2][0] + 1, dp[1][2])` if the count of `2` in the `cards` list is greater than 1. `dp[0][0]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected, `i` remains 0, and `n` is greater than 0. `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `dp[0][0]` is the value of `dp[1][0]` if the count of `1` in the `cards` list is 0, otherwise it is `max(dp[1][0], dp[2][-1] + 1)` if the count of `1` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, or `max(dp[1][0], 1, dp[1][1])` if the count of `1` in the `cards` list is greater than 1. `dp[0][1]` is equal to `dp[1][1]` if the count of `2` in the `cards` list is 0, `max(dp[1][1], dp[2][0] + 1)` if the count of `2` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, or `max(dp[1][1], dp[2][0] + 1, dp[1][2])` if the count of `2` in the `cards` list is greater than 1. For `j > 1`, `dp[0][j]` holds the value of `dp[1][j]` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0, otherwise it holds the maximum value between `dp[1][j]` and `dp[2][j - 1] + 1` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, or the maximum value between `dp[1][j]`, `dp[2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[1][j + 1]` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is greater than 1. `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
