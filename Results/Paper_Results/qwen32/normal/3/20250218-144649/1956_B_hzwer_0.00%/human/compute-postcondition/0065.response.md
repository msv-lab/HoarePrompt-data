The code snippet `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. This means that the value at `dp[i][j]` will now be the same as the value at `dp[i + 1][j]`.

Output State: **`dp[0][j]` holds the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from position `j` in the `cards` list. If the `cards` list does not contain `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the `cards` list contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is the maximum value between `dp[1][j]` and `dp[2][j - 1] + 1`. If the `cards` list contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[0][j]` is the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. `n` is at least 1, and `j` is `1`. `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.**

In simpler terms, `dp[i][j]` now has the same value as `dp[i + 1][j]`, and all other conditions and values remain unchanged.
