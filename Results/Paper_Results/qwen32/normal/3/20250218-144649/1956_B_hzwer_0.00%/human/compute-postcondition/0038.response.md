Postcondition: **`dp` table with `dp[0][j]` holding the maximum value between `dp[1][j]` and `dp[2][j - 1] + 1` if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is exactly 1, otherwise `dp[0][j]` is updated to `max(dp[1][j], dp[2][j - 1] + 1, dp[1][j + 1])`. `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is not 0.**
