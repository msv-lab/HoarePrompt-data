To determine the output of the print statement, we need to analyze the expression `2 + m // b` given the initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer ≥ 1 (though it is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
- `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18).
- `b` is a positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 10^18).
- `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^18).
- `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`.

### Expression Analysis:
- `m // b` performs integer division of `m` by `b`. This means it computes the largest integer `k` such that `b * k ≤ m`.
- The result of `m // b` is then added to 2.

### Output Calculation:
The output will be `2 + (m // b)`. Since the exact values of `m` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute a specific numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of `m` and `b`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output `2` plus the integer division result of `m` divided by `b`.

Output: **2 + (m // b) (where m // b is the integer division of m by b)**
