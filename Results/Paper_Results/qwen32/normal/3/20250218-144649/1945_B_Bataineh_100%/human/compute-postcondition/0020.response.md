To determine what will be printed by the `print(2 + m // a)` statement, we need to understand the values of the variables `a`, `m`, and `b` as per the initial state provided. However, the initial state does not provide explicit values for `a` and `m`. It only mentions that `a`, `b`, and `m` are newly assigned input integers.

Given this, we can describe the output in terms of these variables:

- `m // a` is the integer division of `m` by `a`. This means it will yield the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.
- `2 + m // a` adds 2 to the result of the integer division.

Since the exact values of `a` and `m` are not specified, we cannot compute a numerical value for the expression `2 + m // a`. However, we can describe the output precisely in terms of the variables.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2 + m // a (where m // a is the integer division of m by a)**
