Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is flawed and does not account for the correct overlap of fireworks launched by the two installations.

To determine the correct maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and the visibility duration `m`. The correct approach involves finding the number of fireworks launched by each installation within a period of time that includes their overlap and then determining the maximum overlap of their visibility periods.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:

1. Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine how many fireworks are launched by each installation within a period of LCM.
3. Calculate the number of fireworks that are visible at the same time by considering the visibility duration `m` and the overlap of the launch times.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        count_a = m // a + 1
        count_b = m // b + 1
        count_overlap = m // lcm_ab + 1
        max_fireworks = count_a + count_b - count_overlap
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This program calculates the correct maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time by considering the LCM of `a` and `b` and the visibility duration `m`.
