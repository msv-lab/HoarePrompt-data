Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are newly assigned input integers, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the condition `m < a and m < b` holds. Otherwise, the condition `m < a and m < b` does not hold. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1.**
