To determine the output of the print statement, we need to understand the values of the variables `m` and `b` as they are the only ones used in the expression `2 + m // b`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are newly assigned input integers.
- `i` is `i + 1`, but `i` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

Since `a`, `b`, and `m` are newly assigned input integers, we don't have their specific values. However, we can describe the expression `2 + m // b` in terms of these variables.

The expression `m // b` performs integer division of `m` by `b`, which means it divides `m` by `b` and rounds down to the nearest whole number. The result of this integer division is then added to 2.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be `2` plus the result of the integer division of `m` by `b`.

Output: **2 + m // b (where m and b are input integers)**
