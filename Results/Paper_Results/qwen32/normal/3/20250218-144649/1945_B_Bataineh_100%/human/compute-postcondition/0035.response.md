Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` for each of the `t` test cases, where `a` and `b` represent the frequencies of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and `m` is the time each firework is visible in the sky. For each test case, the function calculates and returns the number of moments in time when fireworks from both installations are visible in the sky simultaneously.**
