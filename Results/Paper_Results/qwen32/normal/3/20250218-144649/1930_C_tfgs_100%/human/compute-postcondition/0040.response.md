The code snippet `cnt -= adv` decrements the value of `cnt` by the value of `adv`. The other variables (`adv`, `ans`, `a`, `counter`, `cur`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Given that `adv` is a positive integer and `cnt` is some integer, the new value of `cnt` will be its previous value minus `adv`.

Output State: **`adv` will be a positive integer; `ans` will have `adv` new elements appended, which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `adv - 1`; `j` will range from 0 to `adv - 1`; `cnt` is decreased by `adv`; other variables like `a`, `counter`, `cur`, `i` remain unchanged.**
