Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is `n - len(a)`; `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        cur -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1
    cur += counter[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1, `cur` is updated to `cur + counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv` if `i > 0`, `ans` is a list with `adv` elements, each equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` from 0 to `adv - 1` if `i > 0`, and an additional element `a[i]` appended to it. If `i` is not greater than 0, `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged except `ans` now includes `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object with the count of `a[i]` decremented by 1, `cur` is updated to `cur + counter[a[i]]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` now includes `a[i]`, and `cur` is now equal to its previous value plus `counter[a[i]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is unchanged, `j` is set to `adv`, `ans` has `adv` new elements appended to it and an additional element `a[i]`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, and `cur` is decreased by `adv`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `adv`, `j`, `ans`, `cnt`, or `cur`. `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1. `cur` is increased by `counter[a[i]]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
