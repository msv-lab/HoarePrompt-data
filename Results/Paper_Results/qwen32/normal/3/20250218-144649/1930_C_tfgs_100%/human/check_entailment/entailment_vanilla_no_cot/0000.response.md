Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to achieve the lexicographically largest array `b`. The key issue lies in how the program handles the insertion of elements into the set `S` and the construction of the final array `b`.

Here are the main problems with the program:

1. **Order of Insertions**: The program adds `a[i] + i + 1` to the set `S` for all `i` in a single pass, which does not allow for strategic selection of indices to maximize the lexicographical order of `b`. The problem specifies that the operations must be performed exactly `n` times, and the selection of `i` in each step can affect the final result.

2. **Handling Duplicates**: The program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `S` after all insertions, but it does not consider the order of insertions when constructing `b`. The problem requires that duplicates are not inserted into `S`, and the program should ensure that the largest possible elements are added first to maximize the lexicographical order.

3. **Constructing `b`**: The program sorts the unique elements of `S` in descending order and then tries to fill in the gaps with decremented values, but this does not guarantee the lexicographically largest array `b`. The correct approach should involve selecting the optimal index `i` in each step to maximize the value of `a[i] + i + 1`.

To solve the problem correctly, one should:
- Use a strategy to select the index `i` in each step that maximizes the value of `a[i] + i + 1` while ensuring that duplicates are not inserted into `S`.
- After all insertions, sort the elements of `S` in descending order to form the array `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    S = set()
    for i in range(n):
        while a:
            max_val = max(a)
            max_index = a.index(max_val)
            new_val = max_val + max_index + 1
            if new_val not in S:
                S.add(new_val)
                a.pop(max_index)
                break
            else:
                a.pop(max_index)
    b = sorted(S, reverse=True)
    print(*b)
```

This corrected program ensures that the largest possible values are added to `S` in each step, and it correctly constructs the lexicographically largest array `b`.
