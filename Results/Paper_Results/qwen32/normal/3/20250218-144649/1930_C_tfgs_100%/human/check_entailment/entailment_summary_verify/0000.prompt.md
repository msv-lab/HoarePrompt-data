You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        cur += counter[a[i]]
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an array of integers by incrementing each element by its 1-based index, then constructs a new list by inserting additional elements between the sorted unique elements of the modified array based on specific rules, and finally prints the resulting list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Recap
1. **Input**:
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case starts with an integer `n`, the length of the array `a`.
   - Followed by `n` integers representing the elements of array `a`.

2. **Process**:
   - Perform the following operation exactly `n` times:
     1. Select an index `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ |a|`.
     2. Insert `a[i] + i` into set `S`.
     3. Delete `a[i]` from `a`.
   - After `n` operations, construct array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output the lexicographically largest `b`.

### Analysis of the Provided Program
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
   - It modifies each element in `a` to `a[i] + i + 1`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each modified element.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.
   - It constructs the result array `ans` by adding elements from the sorted set and filling in the gaps based on the counts from the `Counter`.
   - Finally, it prints the result array `ans`.

### Potential Issues
1. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic of modifying each element to `a[i] + i + 1` seems correct.
   - The use of a set to remove duplicates is appropriate.
   - Sorting the set in descending order is correct.
   - The filling of gaps based on counts seems to be an attempt to handle duplicates correctly.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **All elements are the same**: The code should handle this correctly by using the `Counter` to account for duplicates.
   - **All elements are different**: The code should handle this correctly by simply sorting the set.
   - **Large values**: The code should handle large values of `a[i]` and `i` correctly due to the use of Python's integers, which can handle large values.

### Testing the Program
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Provided Example 1
```
Input:
3
2
2 1
5
1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
3
6 4 8

Output:
3 2 
1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
11 7 6 
```
The program correctly produces the expected output for these examples.

#### Additional Edge Case 1
```
Input:
1
5
1 1 1 1 1

Output:
5 4 3 2 1
```
The program should produce `5 5 5 5 5` because each element will be `1 + i` and the set will only contain `5`.

#### Additional Edge Case 2
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
9 8 7 6 5
```
The program should correctly produce `9 8 7 6 5` because each element will be `a[i] + i + 1`.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program and testing it with various cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles duplicates correctly, sorts the set in descending order, and fills in the gaps based on counts.

**Correctness: True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case that I can think of.
