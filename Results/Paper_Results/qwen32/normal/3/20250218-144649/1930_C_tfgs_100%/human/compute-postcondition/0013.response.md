The code snippet calculates the value of `cnt` as the difference between `n` and the length of the list `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the original list `a`, and `cur` is 0. The value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains an unknown variable.

The variable `cnt` is newly introduced and assigned the value `n - len(a)`. This operation does not affect the values of `a`, `counter`, or `cur`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is `n - len(a)`**.
