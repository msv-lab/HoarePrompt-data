Output State: **`adv` is a positive integer; `ans` has two new elements appended, which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`; `j` is `j + 2`**

Explanation: The code appends another element to the list `ans`, which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 before this operation, the new value of `j` is `j + 1`. Therefore, the second appended element to `ans` is `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`. The value of `adv` remains unchanged, and `j` is incremented by 2 in total.
