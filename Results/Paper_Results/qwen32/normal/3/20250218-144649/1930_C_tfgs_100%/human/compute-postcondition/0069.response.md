To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the given information step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`a`**: This is a list that remains unchanged throughout the described process.
2. **`counter`**: This is a dictionary (or similar structure) that holds the count of each element in the list `a`. Each count in `counter` is decremented by 1.
3. **`cur`**: This is the sum of the counts of all elements in `a` after each count has been decremented by 1. Essentially, `cur` is the total number of elements left to process after decrementing.
4. **`cnt`**: This is initialized to 0. It seems to be a counter that might be used to add additional elements to `ans`.
5. **`ans`**: This list starts with all elements of `a` in their original order. Additionally, it includes elements inserted based on some `adv` calculations and `cnt` additional elements, each being the last element of `ans` at the time of the iteration minus 1.

### Detailed Explanation

- **`ans` Initialization**: `ans` begins with all elements of `a`.
- **Insertions in `ans`**: Elements are inserted into `ans` based on some `adv` calculations. However, the exact nature of `adv` and how it influences `ans` is not explicitly detailed. For the sake of this explanation, we will assume that the `adv` calculations result in some additional elements being inserted between the original elements of `a`.
- **Additional Elements**: After the insertions, `cnt` additional elements are added to `ans`. Each of these elements is the last element of `ans` at the time of the iteration minus 1. Given that `cnt` is initialized to 0, no additional elements are added based on `cnt` unless `cnt` is incremented during the process, which is not mentioned here.

### Conclusion

Since the exact nature of `adv` and the process of inserting elements based on it is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the initial elements of `a` and the potential additional elements inserted based on `adv`.

Given the information, the output will be:
- The elements of `a` in their original order.
- Additional elements inserted based on the `adv` calculations.
- Since `cnt` is 0, no additional elements are added based on `cnt`.

Thus, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **elements of `a` in their original order, plus additional elements inserted based on `adv` calculations**
