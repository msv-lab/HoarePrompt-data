The code snippet `a[i] += i + 1` modifies the element at index `i` of the list `a` by adding `i + 1` to it. Given the initial state where `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 0, the element at index `0` of the list `a` will be incremented by `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` is increased by 1.**
