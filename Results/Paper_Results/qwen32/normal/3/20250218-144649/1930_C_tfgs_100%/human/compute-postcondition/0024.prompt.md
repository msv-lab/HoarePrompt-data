Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is greater than 0; `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(adv):
    ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least two elements such that `a[i - 1] > a[i] + 1`, `n` is greater than `len(a)`, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list with one additional element `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a) - 1`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least two elements such that `a[i - 1] > a[i] + 1`, `n` is greater than `len(a)`, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list with two elements, both equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a) - 1`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `j` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order with at least two elements such that `a[i - 1] > a[i] + 1`, `n` is greater than `len(a)`, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the counts of each element in the original list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list with three elements, the first two are `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and the third is `a[i - 1] - 3`, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len(a) - 1`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `j` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
