In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will perform some operations (which are omitted in the provided code snippet).

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to focus on the variable `t` since it is the only variable mentioned in the loop head. The variable `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), which means that the loop will execute at least once and at most \(2 \cdot 10^4\) times.

Since the loop head only involves `t` and the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, no other variables (`n`, `a`, etc.) need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing. The values of `n` and the list `a` are relevant to the operations inside the loop body, not the loop head.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts only needs to ensure that `t` is set to a value within the specified range to allow the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**
