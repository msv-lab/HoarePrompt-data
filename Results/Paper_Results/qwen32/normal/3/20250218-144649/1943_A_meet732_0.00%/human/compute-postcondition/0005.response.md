The provided code snippet increments the value at index `i` of the list `cntl` by 1. Given the initial state, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros. After executing the code, the value at index `i` of `cntl` will be 1 (since it was previously 0).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one integer, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at index `i` is 1 and all other values are 0.**
