The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` is at least 1.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`.
- `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
- `c` is either 0 or 1.
- `j` is incremented by 1 if `cntl[j] < 2`. If `cntl[j]` is not less than 2, `j` is not incremented further.

The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has been incremented if `cntl[j] < 2`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1, provided that `j` is still less than `n`.

Let's assume `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1` if `k + 1` is still within the range `[1, n]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration and `k + 1 <= n`**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, provided `j` is still less than or equal to `n`**.

To be more specific, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the next state would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration and `k + 1 <= n`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can simply state that `j` is incremented by 1:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is incremented by 1**.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is incremented by 1**.
