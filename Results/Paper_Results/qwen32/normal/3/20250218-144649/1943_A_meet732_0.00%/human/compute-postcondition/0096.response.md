Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`. `n` is at least 1, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is set to 1. If `c` is false or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `c` retains its previous value.**
