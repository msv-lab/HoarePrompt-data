The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 0 and `n-1`. It then determines and prints the smallest integer `j` (from 1 to `n`) such that the count of `j` in the list `a` is less than 2, or `n` if no such `j` exists. If the count of 0 in the list `a` is 0, it prints 0 immediately.
