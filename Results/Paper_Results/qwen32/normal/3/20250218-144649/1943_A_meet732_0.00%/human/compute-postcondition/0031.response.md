To determine what will be printed by the `print(j)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the given information about the variables.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
2. **`n`**: At least 1.
3. **`a`**: A list of integers.
4. **`cntl`**: A list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
5. **`c`**: Either 0 or -1.
6. **`j`**: Incremented by 1.

### Analysis:
- The variable `j` is mentioned to be incremented by 1, but there is no specific initial value provided for `j` in the initial state. Typically, in such scenarios, `j` could be initialized to 0, but this is not explicitly stated. For the sake of this problem, we will assume `j` was initialized to 0 before the increment operation.
- Given that `j` is incremented by 1, its new value will be `1`.

### Conclusion:
Since `j` is incremented by 1 and we are assuming its initial value was 0, the value of `j` at the time of the `print(j)` statement will be `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
