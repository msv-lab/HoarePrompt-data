Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is incremented by 1 if `cntl[j] < 2`. If `cntl[j]` is not less than 2, `j` is not incremented further.**
