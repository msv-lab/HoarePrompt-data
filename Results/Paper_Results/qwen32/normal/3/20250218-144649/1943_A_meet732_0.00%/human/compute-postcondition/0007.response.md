The value at index `i` in the list `cntl` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is `a[k]` where `k` is the index of the next element to be processed in the list `a`, the value at `cntl[a[k]]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one integer, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the value at index `a[k]` is now 2 and all other values are 0, `i` is `a[k]` where `k` is the index of the next element to be processed in the list `a`**.
