The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`. The variables `t` and `n` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), and `n` retains its input integer value. The new variable `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
