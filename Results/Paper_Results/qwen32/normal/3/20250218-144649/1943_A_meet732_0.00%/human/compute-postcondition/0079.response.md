The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `cntl` by 1. Given that `cntl` is initially a list of `n + 1` zeros, after the execution of this statement, the value at index `i` will be `1` if it was `0` before, or it will be incremented by `1` if it had a different initial value (though it should be `0` according to the initial state).

Since `i` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `cntl[i]` will be incremented by `1`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `cntl[i]` which is `1`, `n` is an input integer**.
