The given code snippet initializes `cntl` to be a list of `n + 1` zeros. This means that each index of `cntl` from `0` to `n` is set to `0`. The initial state of `t`, `n`, and `a` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is now a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each value is `0`.**
