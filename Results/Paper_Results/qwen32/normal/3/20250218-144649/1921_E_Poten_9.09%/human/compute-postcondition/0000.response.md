Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is an integer equal to the value of `t` read from the input.**

Explanation: The variable `test_cases` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases `t`. The other variables (`h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`) and their constraints remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input statement.
