Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 4. If `clues[3] > clues[5]`, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Draw'` if `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Bob'`. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1`, the conditions for `'Draw'` or `'Bob'` are evaluated as described. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1`, the conditions for `'Draw'` or `'Bob'` are evaluated with a strict inequality. If `clues[3] <= clues[5]`, `answers` remains unchanged or is not set.**
