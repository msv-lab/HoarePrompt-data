Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2] <= clues[4]`, and `clues[0] != 1`. Additionally, `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, the current value of `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less. The condition `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is false, meaning that both `clues[3] - 1` is not greater than `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` and `clues[5] - clues[3]` is not greater than `abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`**
