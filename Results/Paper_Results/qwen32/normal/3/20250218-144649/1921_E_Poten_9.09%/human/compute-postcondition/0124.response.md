The code snippet provided appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The other variables `t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 4, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw'.**
