Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input. The current state satisfies either `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`.**

In simple terms, the `answers` list now contains the string 'Draw', while all other variables remain unchanged.
