Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2] <= clues[4]`, `clues[0] != 1`, `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1. The current value of `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`. Additionally, `clues[3] - 1 < abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` and `clues[5] - clues[3] < abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`**

In simple terms, the output state is that `answers` now contains the string 'Bob', while all other variables retain their initial conditions and constraints.
