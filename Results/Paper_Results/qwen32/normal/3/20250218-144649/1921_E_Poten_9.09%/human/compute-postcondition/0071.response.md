The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated `answers` list with the new element added.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Draw'`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2] <= clues[4]`, `clues[0] != 1`, and either `clues[2] % 2 == 0` and `clues[4] % 2 != 0` or `clues[2] % 2 != 0` and `clues[4] % 2 == 0`. Additionally, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, the current value of `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less. The current state also satisfies the condition that either `clues[5] - 1 - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`**.
