Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 (unchanged in this code snippet). If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1`, then if `clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, `answers` has a new element 'Draw' appended to it. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob'. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1`, then if `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, the `answers` list contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, the `answers` list has an additional element 'Bob' appended to it.**
