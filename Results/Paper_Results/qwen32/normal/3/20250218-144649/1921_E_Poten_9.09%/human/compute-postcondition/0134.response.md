The code snippet appends the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, and `clues` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains 4. The only change is that the list `answers` now contains the string `'Bob'`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 4, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Bob'`**.
