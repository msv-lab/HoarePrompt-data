Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2] <= clues[4]`, `clues[0] != 1`, and either `clues[2] % 2 == 0` and `clues[4] % 2 != 0` or `clues[2] % 2 != 0` and `clues[4] % 2 == 0`. Additionally, `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`.**

Explanation: The list `answers` now contains the string 'Alice'. All other variables retain their initial values.
