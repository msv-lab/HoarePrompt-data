The code snippet `answers.append('Alice')` adds the string 'Alice' to the end of the list `answers`. Since `answers` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it was an empty list or a list that existed but was not modified before this operation. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 4, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice'.**
