Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 (unchanged in this code snippet), `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice'.**

Natural language: The value of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged, as does the list `clues` and the incremented value of `i`. The list `answers` now contains the string 'Alice'.
