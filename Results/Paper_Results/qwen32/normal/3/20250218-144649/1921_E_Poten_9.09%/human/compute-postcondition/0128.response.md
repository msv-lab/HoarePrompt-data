Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 4, and `answers` is a list containing the string `'Draw'` if `clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string `'Bob'`.**
