Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1. If `clues[3] > clues[5]`, then based on the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]`, and the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, `answers` is set to 'Draw' or 'Alice'. Specifically, if `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1`, `answers` is 'Draw' if `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise `answers` is 'Alice'. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1`, `answers` is 'Draw' if `clues[5] - 2 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise `answers` is 'Alice'. If `clues[3] <= clues[5]`, the `answers` is not modified by this block.**
