Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2] <= clues[4]`, `clues[0] != 1`, and either `clues[2] % 2 == 0` and `clues[4] % 2 != 0` or `clues[2] % 2 != 0` and `clues[4] % 2 == 0`. Additionally, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `clues[3] < clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1. The condition `(clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true.**

In natural language: The variable `answers` now contains the string 'Draw'. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
