### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's correctness based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The game involves removing stones from piles where each player can remove the same number of stones from each non-empty pile in a single turn. The player who cannot make a move loses. The optimal strategy involves the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes.

#### Program Analysis:

**Function `func_1(a)`**:
- **Purpose**: To transform the list of pile sizes into a list of differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.
- **Implementation**: 
  - `a_new = sorted(list(set(a)))`: This creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes.
  - `a_temp = a_new.copy()`: A copy of the sorted unique pile sizes is made.
  - The loop `for i in range(1, len(a_new))` modifies `a_new` such that each element (except the first) is the difference between the current element and the previous one in the sorted unique list.
- **Output**: A list where each element (except the first) is the difference between consecutive unique pile sizes.

**Function `func_2(a, n)`**:
- **Purpose**: To determine the winner of the game for a given set of piles.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Base Cases**:
    - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins.
    - If there are two piles (`n == 2`):
      - If the first pile size is even, Alice wins.
      - If the first pile size is odd, Bob wins.
  - **Recursive Case**:
    - `winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`: Recursively determine the winner for the game excluding the first pile.
    - The function then decides the winner based on the outcome of the recursive call and the size of the first pile.
- **Output**: Returns `1` if Alice wins and `2` if Bob wins.

#### Evaluation:

The program's logic is flawed and does not align with the optimal strategy for the game, which involves the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes. Here are specific issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Base Case Handling**:
   - For `n == 1`, the program correctly determines that Alice wins because there is only one pile and she can take all stones.
   - For `n == 2`, the program incorrectly determines the winner based on the parity of the first pile size. This is not a correct strategy for the game.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - The recursive call `winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` and the subsequent decision-making process do not correctly handle the game's rules and optimal play strategy.
   - The program does not use the Nim-sum, which is the correct approach to determine the winner in this type of game.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the third test case with piles `[1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]`. The correct strategy involves calculating the Nim-sum of these numbers:
     \[
     1 \oplus 3 \oplus 9 \oplus 7 \oplus 4 \oplus 2 \oplus 100 = 128
     \]
     Since the Nim-sum is non-zero, Alice has a winning strategy. However, the provided program does not use this approach and may incorrectly determine the winner.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `False`.

**Final: False**
