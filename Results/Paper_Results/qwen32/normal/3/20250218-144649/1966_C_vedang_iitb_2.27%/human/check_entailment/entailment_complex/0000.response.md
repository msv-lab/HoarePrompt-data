### Reasoning:

The provided Python program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which are used to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules. Let's analyze each function in the context of the problem.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: The function is supposed to process the list of stone piles to prepare it for the win condition check.
- **Implementation**: 
  - It first removes duplicates and sorts the list of piles.
  - Then, it calculates the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.
- **Issue**: The transformed list `a_new` is not directly useful for determining the winner based on the rules of the game. The game's outcome is more directly related to the parity (odd or even) of the number of piles and their sizes, not the differences between them.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function is supposed to determine the winner based on the processed list of piles.
- **Implementation**:
  - For a single pile, Alice wins.
  - For two piles, it checks if the smaller pile size is even. If it is, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
  - For more than two piles, it recursively checks the rest of the piles. If the next player can win or the current player can force a win by not leaving a single pile of size 1, the current player wins.

### Analysis:
- **Game Theory Insight**: The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where the winning strategy depends on the XOR of the pile sizes. However, the provided implementation does not follow this principle.
- **Simplified Analysis**: The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the game rules. Specifically, `func_1` does not transform the input in a way that helps `func_2` correctly determine the winner.

### Conclusion:
The given functions do not correctly determine the winner of the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
