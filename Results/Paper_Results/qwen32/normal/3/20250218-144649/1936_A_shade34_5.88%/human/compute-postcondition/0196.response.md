The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `pans` will have 2 appended to it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 2, `mak2` is the final value of `mak`, `s` is the new input string, `i` is 2, `pans` has an additional element `2` appended to it.**

In simpler terms, `pans` now includes the value `2` at the end, and all other variables retain their initial values.
