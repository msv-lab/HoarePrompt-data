The value of `mak` is assigned the value of `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, `pans`) remain unchanged. The initial state specified that `i` is incremented by 1, so `mak` will take the new value of `i` after this increment.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1; `mak` is the new value of `i` after it has been incremented.**
