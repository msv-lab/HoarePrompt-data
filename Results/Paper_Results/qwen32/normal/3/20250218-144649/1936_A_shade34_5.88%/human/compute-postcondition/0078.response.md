Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `t` is at least 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`.
- `mak` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak` is explicitly given as 0.
- `mak2` is explicitly given as 0, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `pans` is a list of indices where the input was `=`, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `t` and `n` are defined with conditions but not directly used in the print statement.
- The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state.

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, it is impossible to determine its exact value. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the known values and the undefined variable `i`.

The print statement will output:
- A literal string `?`
- The value of `mak` which is 0
- The value of `mak` again which is 0
- The value of `i` which is undefined
- The value of `i` again which is undefined

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is an undefined variable)**
