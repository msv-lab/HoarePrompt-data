The code snippet provided sets `mak` to 0. This means that the previous value of `mak` is disregarded, and `mak` is now explicitly 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=`. If the input string `s` was `<` at any point, `mak` is set to 0 and `pans` contains only the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`.**
