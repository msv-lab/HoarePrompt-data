The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. The initial state specifies that `mak` is 0, and after the execution of the code, `mak` will hold the value of `i`. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans`) remain unchanged. The current input being `'>'` does not affect the variables' values directly but is part of the context.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak` is `i`; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; the current input is '>'**.
