The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `1, n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last index that was processed, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was the last processed index in the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `n` should remain the same, but it must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to the final value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`, `i` is the last processed index + 1**
