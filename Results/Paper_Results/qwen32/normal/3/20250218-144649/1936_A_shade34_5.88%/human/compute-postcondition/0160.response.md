Postcondition: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to the final value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`, `i` is the last processed index + 1. If the input string `s` was `<`, then `mak` is equal to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` retains its original value.**
