To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`, which involves the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, so we need to ensure that the loop can start with `i` being 1. This means that `n` must be at least 2 so that the range `(1, n)` includes 1.

2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range `(1, n)` will be non-empty only if `n` is greater than 1.

The other variables (`t`, `mak2`, `pans`, `mak`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to the final value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`, `mak` is 0**
