To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their descriptions:**
   - `t` is at least 0 (but its exact value is not specified).
   - `n` is greater than 1 (but its exact value is not specified).
   - `mak2` is equal to the final value of `mak` (implying `mak` has been assigned some value, but it is not specified).
   - `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`. Since the input string `s` is not provided, the exact contents of `pans` are not known.
   - `i` is the last processed index + 2. Again, without knowing the exact input string `s` or the process that determines `i`, we can't determine its exact value.

2. **Print statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`. This means it will print a literal `?` followed by the value of `mak`, `mak` again, `i`, and `i` again.

3. **Output description:**
   - We know the value of `mak` will be printed twice, and the value of `i` will be printed twice.
   - Since the exact values of `mak` and `i` are not specified in the initial state, we will describe them in terms of their definitions.

Given the information, the output will be:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] (where [mak] is the final value of mak and [i] is the last processed index + 2)**
