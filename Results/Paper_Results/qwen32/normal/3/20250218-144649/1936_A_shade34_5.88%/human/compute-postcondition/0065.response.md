Postcondition: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1. If the input is '>', `mak` is set to the new value of `i` after it has been incremented.**
