To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` (number of test cases) is at least 1.
- `n` is unchanged, but its value is not specified.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
- `i` is incremented by 1, meaning `i` has been incremented from its initial value (which is not specified, but it is important to note that it has been incremented by 1).

### Variables and Their Values:
- `mak` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but since `mak2` is mentioned and is 0, we can infer that `mak` might be 0 (as `mak2` could be a variation or a different variable, but without further context, we assume `mak` is 0).
- `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements. Let's denote the elements of `pans` as `pans[0], pans[1], pans[2], ...`.
- `i` has been incremented by 1, so if `i` was initially 0, it is now 1. If `i` was initially 1, it is now 2, and so on.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```
- `mak` is assumed to be 0 (based on the given information).
- `pans[mak]` translates to `pans[0]`, which is the first element of the `pans` list.
- `pans[i]` translates to `pans[i]`, where `i` is the incremented value. If `i` was initially 0, it is now 1, so `pans[i]` is `pans[1]`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- A question mark (`?`).
- The first element of the `pans` list (`pans[0]`).
- The first element of the `pans` list again (`pans[0]`).
- The second element of the `pans` list (`pans[1]`).
- The second element of the `pans` list again (`pans[1]`).

Since the exact values of `pans[0]` and `pans[1]` are not provided, we describe them in terms of their positions in the `pans` list.

Output: **? [pans[0]], [pans[0]], [pans[1]], [pans[1]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the pans list and pans[1] is the second element of the pans list)**
