The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range it is iterating over, which is `pans`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` accordingly.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at some value, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `pans`. Since `pans` must have at least 2 elements, the loop can execute at least once. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given that the loop is currently executing and `i` is the current index, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements. If the current input is '>', then `mak` is set to the current index `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, and `i` is the only variable that changes in the loop head, we adjust `i` to be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is `i + 1`**.

To be more specific, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was some value `k`, then at the start of the next iteration `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is `k + 1`**, where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. 

However, since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generally say:

State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements; `i` is incremented by 1**.
