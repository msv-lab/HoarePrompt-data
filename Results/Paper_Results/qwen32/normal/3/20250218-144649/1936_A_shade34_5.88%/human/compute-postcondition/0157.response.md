To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step by step.

### Initial State:
1. **`t`** is at least 0.
2. **`n`** is greater than 1.
3. **`mak2`** is equal to the final value of **`mak`**.
4. **`pans`** is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`.
5. **`i`** is the last processed index + 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is straightforward and prints a literal `?` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak` again, `i`, and `i` again.

### Values:
- **`mak`**: The value of `mak` is not explicitly given, but we know `mak2` is equal to the final value of `mak`. Since `mak2` is not used in the print statement, we just need to know that `mak` has some value (let's call it `mak_value`).
- **`i`**: The value of `i` is the last processed index + 1. This means `i` is an integer, and its exact value depends on the processing done in the code (which is not provided here). We can denote this value as `i_value`.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? mak_value mak_value i_value i_value (where mak_value is the final value of mak and i_value is the last processed index + 1)**

Since the exact values of `mak` and `i` are not provided, we describe them in terms of their definitions and roles in the program.
