Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

Initial State:
- `t` is at least 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's provided for context).
- `n` is greater than 1 (though `n` is not used in the print statement, it's provided for context).
- `mak2` is 0 (though `mak2` is not used in the print statement, it's provided for context).
- `pans` is a list of all indices `i` for which the input was `=`.
- `mak` is set based on the current input (the exact value of `mak` is not specified, but it's mentioned that it's set based on some input).
- `i` is 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Based on the information provided:
- The string `'?'` is printed as is.
- `mak` is printed twice, but its exact value is not specified. We only know that it is set based on the current input.
- `i` is printed twice, and its value is explicitly given as 2.

Given this, the output will be the string `'?'` followed by the value of `mak` twice and the value 2 twice.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is the value of mak set based on the current input)**
