To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `t` is at least 0.
2. `n` is the input integer (its exact value is not provided).
3. `mak2` is equal to `mak` (the value of `mak` is not provided).
4. `pans` is a list containing at least 3 indices (the values in the list are not provided).
5. `i` is 2.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
- The first argument to the `print` function is the string `'?'`.
- The second and third arguments are `pans[mak]`. Since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and there is no indication that `mak` changes, `pans[mak]` refers to the element in the `pans` list at the index `mak`.
- The fourth and fifth arguments are `pans[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `pans[i]` refers to the element in the `pans` list at index 2.

Since the exact values of `mak` and the elements in the `pans` list are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Output Description:
- The first value to be printed is the string `'?'`.
- The second and third values to be printed are the same and are the element at index `mak` in the `pans` list.
- The fourth and fifth values to be printed are the same and are the element at index 2 in the `pans` list.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[2]] [pans[2]] (where pans[mak] is the element at index mak in the pans list and pans[2] is the element at index 2 in the pans list)**
