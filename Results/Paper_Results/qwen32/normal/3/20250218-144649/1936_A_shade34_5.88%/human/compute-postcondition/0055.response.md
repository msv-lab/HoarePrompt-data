In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range starting from 1 up to, but not including, the length of the list `pans`. To ensure that the loop executes, the length of `pans` must be at least 2, because the loop starts from index 1 and requires at least one more element to iterate over.

Let's break down the objects in the loop head:
- The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `len(pans) - 1`.
- The length of `pans` must be at least 2 to ensure that the loop runs at least once.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution, so they don't need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `pans` has at least 2 elements.

State: **`t` (number of test cases) is at least 1; `n` is unchanged; `mak` is 0; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices i for which the input was '=', and `pans` must have at least 2 elements**.
