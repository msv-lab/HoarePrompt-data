Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input string `s` was `=` or the last index `i` for which `s` was `<`, `i` is the last processed index + 2. If the input string `s` is `<`, then `mak` is updated to the value of `i`. Otherwise, `mak` retains its previous value.***
