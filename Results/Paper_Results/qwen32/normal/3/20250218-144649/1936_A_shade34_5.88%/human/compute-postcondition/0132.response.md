The given code snippet is:

```
mak = i
```

This line of code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, we must assume that `i` has some value, but we do not know what it is. Given this, the only variable that changes is `mak`, which now holds the value of `i`.

Since the value of `i` is not specified, we can only say that `mak` is now equal to `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing at least two indices, and `mak` is equal to `i`.**
