Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `mak` is set to `i`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to the current value of `i`. The value of `i` is then incremented by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
