The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. It then prints a series of pairs of integers based on the value of `n`. Specifically, it prints '1 1', '1 2', and either '2 3' if `n` is 3, or '2 4' followed by pairs 'j j' for each `j` from 4 to `n` if `n` is greater than 3.
