To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the print statement itself.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50
- `i` is set to the value of `t`
- `n` must be at least 4
- `j` is 4

The print statement is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break it down:
- `j` is explicitly given the value 4.
- The print statement converts `j` to a string twice and concatenates them with a space in between.

So, `str(j)` will be `'4'` both times, and the concatenation will result in `'4 4'`.

Output: **4 4**
