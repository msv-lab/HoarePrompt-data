The value of `n` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition for `j` depends on the new value of `n`. If the new `n` is 3, no change is made to `n`, and `j` remains unchanged if it was previously defined. If the new `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`. 

Given the initial conditions and the new assignment to `n`, the output state will reflect this new value for `n` and the subsequent value for `j` if applicable.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, `i` is `t`, `n` is the integer input by the user, and if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, then `j` is `n` + 1. If `n` is 3, `j` remains unchanged from its previous definition or is undefined if it wasn't defined before.**
