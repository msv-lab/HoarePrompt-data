Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
   - `i` is defined as `t-1`.
   - `n` is the integer input by the user.
   - If `n` is 3, `j` remains unchanged from its previous definition or is undefined if it wasn't defined before.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is defined as `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('1 1')`.

The print statement `print('1 1')` simply outputs the string `'1 1'`. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` do not affect the output of this print statement because the string to be printed is explicitly defined as `'1 1'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **1 1**
