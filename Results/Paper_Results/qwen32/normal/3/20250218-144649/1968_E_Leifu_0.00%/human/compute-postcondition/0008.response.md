The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'2 4'`. This string is explicitly provided in the code and does not depend on any variables or conditions defined in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The initial state provides information about `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet.
2. The `print` statement is `print('2 4')`, which means it will output the string `'2 4'` as it is.

Since the string to be printed is explicitly given, there is no need to derive its value from any variables or conditions.

Output: **2 4**
