To determine the final state of the loop, let's analyze the loop and the given output states after the first few iterations.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(4, n + 1):
    print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

From the problem statement and the given output states, we can infer the following:

- The loop iterates from `j = 4` to `j = n` inclusive.
- After the first iteration, `j` is 4.
- After the second iteration, `j` is 5.
- After the third iteration, `j` is 6.

From the given output states, we can see that the loop will continue until `j` reaches `n`. Therefore, the final value of `j` after all iterations will be `n`.

The variables `t` and `i` are not modified within the loop, so their values remain the same as the initial state.

Given that `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute at least once, the loop will execute `n - 3` times (since it starts at 4 and goes up to `n` inclusive).

The final state of the loop will be:
- `t` remains the same as the initial state.
- `i` remains the same as the initial state.
- `j` will be `n` after the loop finishes.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, i is t, n is the integer input by the user and must be at least 4, j is n.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes, `j` will be equal to `n`, and the values of `t` and `i` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
