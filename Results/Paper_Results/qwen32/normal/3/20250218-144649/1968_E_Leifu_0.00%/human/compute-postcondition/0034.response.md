Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that **1 <= t <= 50**.
2. `i` is defined as `t-1`.
3. `n` is the integer input by the user.
4. The value of `j` depends on the value of `n`:
   - If `n` is **3**, `j` remains unchanged from its previous definition or is undefined if it wasn't defined before.
   - If `n` is **greater than or equal to 4**, `j` is set to `n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('1 2')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('1 2')`. This statement is a simple print operation that outputs the string `'1 2'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `j`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'1 2'`.

Output: **1 2**
