Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer that is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is an input string, and the second-to-last character of `b` is '>'. If the current character `b[k]` is not '>', `no_path` is `False`. Otherwise, `no_path` remains `True`.**
