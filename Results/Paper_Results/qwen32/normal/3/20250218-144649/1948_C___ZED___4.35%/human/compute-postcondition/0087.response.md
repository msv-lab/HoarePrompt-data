Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` and `b` are strings, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `b[-2]` is not `'>'`, the state of `no_path` remains unchanged. If `b[-2]` is `'>'` and `n == 1`, the state of `no_path` remains unchanged. If `b[-2]` is `'>'` and `n > 1`, then any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to the largest odd number less than `n-1`) is `'>'` if `no_path` was initially `False`, and `no_path` remains `False`. If `no_path` was initially `True`, it remains `True`.**
