The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that. According to the loop statement `for k in range(0, n, 2)`, `k` is incremented by 2 in each iteration. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was `i + 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be adjusted to the next value in the sequence defined by the loop, which is `k + 2`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was `i + 3`.
2. For the next iteration, `k` should be `k + 2`, i.e., `(i + 3) + 2 = i + 5`.
3. The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than `i + 5`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is `i + 5`, and `no_path` is `False` if the character at index `k` in string `b` is not `'>'`. Otherwise, `no_path` remains `True`.**
