Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the user's input, `b` is the user's input, `no_path` is False, and the current value of `b[k]` is not equal to '>'**

In this output state, the value of `no_path` has been changed from True to False. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and the condition regarding `b[k]`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
