The `print('NO')` statement in the given code snippet will output the string 'NO', regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` as described in the initial state. The print statement is explicitly instructed to output 'NO', and it does not depend on any of the other variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The print statement is `print('NO')`.
2. The string 'NO' is a literal value in the code.
3. The print function will output exactly this string.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
