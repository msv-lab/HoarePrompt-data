You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to pair each '<' with a '>' such that the pairs are either within the same string and non-overlapping, or one is in the first string and the other is directly below it in the second string. The function outputs "YES" if such pairings are possible, otherwise "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, n). The robot performs two actions each second: a free move in any direction (left, right, up, down, but not outside the grid) and a forced move in the direction of the arrow in the new cell.

The key points to consider:
- The robot can change rows only when it is in column `n-1` (because it can only move up or down from there).
- The robot must be able to reach column `n-1` in the second row from some column in the first row.
- Once in the second row, the robot must follow the arrows to reach column `n`.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the logic of the provided program.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of columns.
   - It then reads two strings `a` and `b`, representing the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if the second-to-last arrow in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not pointing right (`>`). If it's not, the robot cannot move to the last column from the second-to-last column, so it prints "NO".
   - If `n == 1`, the robot is already at the target position (2, 1), so it prints "YES". However, this case is not possible since `n` is at least 2 according to the problem constraints.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program initializes `no_path` to `True`, assuming there is no valid path initially.
   - It then checks every even-indexed column in the second row (`b[k]` for `k` in `range(0, n, 2)`). If any of these arrows is not pointing right (`>`), it sets `no_path` to `False`, indicating that there might be a valid path.
   - Next, it resets `no_path` to `True` and checks every odd-indexed column in the first row (`a[k]` for `k` in `range(1, n-1, 2)`). If any of these arrows is not pointing right (`>`), it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` remains `True` after these checks, it prints "YES", indicating a valid path exists. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Path Checking:**
   - The program only checks even-indexed columns in the second row and odd-indexed columns in the first row for right-pointing arrows. This is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target.
   - The program should consider the entire path from (1, 1) to (2, n), considering both rows and the arrows in each cell. The current logic does not account for the robot's ability to move between rows and follow the arrows correctly.

2. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The logic for determining `no_path` is flawed. Simply checking certain columns for right-pointing arrows does not guarantee that the robot can follow a valid path to the target.
   - The program does not simulate the robot's movements and arrow-following in a comprehensive manner.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified in the program's logic, it is clear that the program does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the provided problem description.

**Correctness: False**
