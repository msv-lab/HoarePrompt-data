Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of equal even length containing '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to pair each '<' with a '>' such that the pairs are either within the same string and non-overlapping, or one is in the first string and the other is directly below it in the second string. The function outputs "YES" if such pairings are possible, otherwise "NO".**
