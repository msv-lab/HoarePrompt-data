The code snippet assigns `False` to the variable `no_path`. No other variables are affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer that is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is an input string, and the second-to-last character of `b` is '>', `k` is `k + 2`, `no_path` is `False`.**
