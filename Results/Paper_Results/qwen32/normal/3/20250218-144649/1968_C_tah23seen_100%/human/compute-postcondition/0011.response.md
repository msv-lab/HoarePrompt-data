The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `i` is `n - 4`, after the decrement, `i` becomes `n - 5`. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` must be at least 5; `ans` is a list of `n` integers, each equal to 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `1000000000 - arr[i + 1] - arr[i]` and `ans[i + 1]` which is `1000000000 - arr[i + 1]`; `i` is `n - 5`.**
