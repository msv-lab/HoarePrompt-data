Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500; `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the resulting array `a`, such that 2 <= n <= 500; `ans` is a list of `n` integers, each equal to 1000000000; `i` is `n - 2`.
Code of the loop:
while i >= 0:
    ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
    i -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500; `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the resulting array `a`, such that 2 <= n <= 500; `ans` is a list of `n` integers, each equal to 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `1000000000 - arr[i]`; `i` is `n - 3`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500; `n` must be at least 4; `ans` is a list of `n` integers, each equal to 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` and `ans[i + 1]` which is `1000000000 - arr[i + 1]`; `i` is `n - 4`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` must be at least 5; `ans` is a list of `n` integers, each equal to 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `1000000000 - arr[i + 1] - arr[i]` and `ans[i + 1]` which is `1000000000 - arr[i + 1]`; `i` is `n - 5`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
