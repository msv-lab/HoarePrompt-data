Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `i` is n-2, `ends` is a list containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the elements `[s, curr, curr]`, `prev` is `curr`, and `curr` is the element in `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `prev`. Specifically, if `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, then `curr` is set to the second element of `nodes[curr]`. Otherwise, `curr` is set to the first element of `nodes[curr]`.**
