The code snippet appends the value of `key` to the `ends` list. This means that the `ends` list will now include `key` as an additional element. All other variables remain unchanged in terms of their previously described properties and values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree with at least one key-value pair, `i` is n-2, and `ends` is a list containing `key` if the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, otherwise `ends` remains unchanged, plus the newly added `key`.**
