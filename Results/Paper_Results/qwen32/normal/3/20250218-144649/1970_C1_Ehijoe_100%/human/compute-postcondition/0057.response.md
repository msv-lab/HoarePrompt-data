The code appends the value of `e` to the `tree` list. Since `e` is already an element of `tree` (as per the initial state), appending `e` again will result in `tree` containing `e` twice.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `i` is n-2, `ends` is a list containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing all nodes from `s` to `e`, inclusive, with `e` appended again, `prev` is `e`, `curr` is `e`.**
