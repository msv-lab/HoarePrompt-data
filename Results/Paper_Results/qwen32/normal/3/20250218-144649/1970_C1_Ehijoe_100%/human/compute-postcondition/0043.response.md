Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `i` is n-2, `ends` is a list containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the elements `[s, curr, curr]`, `prev` is `curr`, `curr` is an element in `nodes[prev]` but not equal to `e`**

In this output state, the `tree` list now includes an additional element, which is the value of `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged in terms of their descriptions and constraints.
