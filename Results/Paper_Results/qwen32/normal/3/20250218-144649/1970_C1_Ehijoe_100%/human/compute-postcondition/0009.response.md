The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. This overwrites the previous values of `u` and `v` with the new input values. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are the new integers read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` containing `[v]` and `nodes[v]` containing `[u]`, `i` is 1**.
