The code reads two new integers from the input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The previous values of `u` and `v` are overwritten by these new values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are the new integers read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` containing `[v, v]` and `nodes[v]` containing `[u, u]`, `i` is 2**.
