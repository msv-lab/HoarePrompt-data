Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains t integers 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n representing the starting nodes for each round. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is `True`; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    nodes[u].append(v)
    nodes[v].append(u)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` containing `[v]` and `nodes[v]` containing `[u]`, `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are the new integers read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` containing `[v, v]` and `nodes[v]` containing `[u, u]`, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are the new integers read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` containing `[v, v, v]` and `nodes[v]` containing `[u, u, u]`, `i` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
