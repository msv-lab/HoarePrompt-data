The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `edges`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the edges provided in the next `n-1` lines, or the starting nodes provided in the last line. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the newly introduced `edges` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines each contain two integers 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n representing the edges of the tree, and the last line contains t integers 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n representing the starting nodes for each round. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves; `edges` is an empty list.**
