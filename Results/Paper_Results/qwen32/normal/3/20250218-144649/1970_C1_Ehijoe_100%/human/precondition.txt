n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 <= u, v <= n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1) where 1 <= u_1 <= n, representing the starting node for the single round.
