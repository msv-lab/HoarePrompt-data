Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, `i` is n-2, `ends` is a list containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the single element `s`.**

In simple terms, the variable `tree` has been initialized as a list containing the single element `s`. All other variables retain their initial values.
