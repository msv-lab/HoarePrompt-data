The code appends `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Initially, `nodes[u]` contains `[v, v]`. After appending `v`, `nodes[u]` will contain `[v, v, v]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are the new integers read from the input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` containing `[v, v, v]` and `nodes[v]` containing `[u, u]`, `i` is 2**.
