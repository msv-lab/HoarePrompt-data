Functionality: **The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game played on a tree structure. Given the number of nodes `n` in a tree with exactly two leaves and the edges of the tree, along with a starting node, it prints 'Ron' if the number of moves to reach either leaf from the starting node is odd, otherwise it prints 'Hermione'.**
