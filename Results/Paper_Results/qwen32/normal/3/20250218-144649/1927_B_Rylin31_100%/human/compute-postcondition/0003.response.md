The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and then maps these integers into a list named `array`. The variables `t` and `l` remain unchanged, and `s` continues to be a list of `l` zeros. The new variable `array` is introduced and holds the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of `l` zeros; `array` is a list of integers read from the input.**
