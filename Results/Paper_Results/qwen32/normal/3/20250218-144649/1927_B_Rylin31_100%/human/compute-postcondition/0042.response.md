Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is the newly input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 2, `array` is a newly input list of integers that must have at least one element, `ans` is `'ab'`, `j` is the next element in `array` if it exists.**

Explanation: The value at index `j` in the list `s` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
