In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the value obtained from `int(input())`. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning it is not used within the loop body, and thus does not need to be adjusted in the state. The only variable that affects whether the loop will execute is the value that `int(input())` will return.

To ensure the loop executes, the value obtained from `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This value is not directly a variable in the state before the loop, but we can simulate this by specifying that the input must be a positive integer.

State: **Input must be a positive integer**
