Output State: **`[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]` is the input list; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `left + S[i][1]`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `right` has been updated to be the difference between the second element of the last sublist in the input list `S` and the second element of the sublist at index `i` in the list `S`. All other variables retain their previously described states.
