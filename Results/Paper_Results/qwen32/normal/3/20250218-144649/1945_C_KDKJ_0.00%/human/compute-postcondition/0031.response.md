Postcondition: **`[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]; ans` is 0; `satisfy` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `left + count_1`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + count_1)`. Additionally, either `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` is true.**
