Output State: **The input list `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `i`; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - lsum`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It merely skips the rest of the loop's code and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their previous values.
