Postcondition: **`[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]` is the input list; `n` is greater than 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `left + count_1`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + count_1)`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, then either `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` is true. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)` is true, then `ans` is set to `i`. `satisfy` remains 0.**
