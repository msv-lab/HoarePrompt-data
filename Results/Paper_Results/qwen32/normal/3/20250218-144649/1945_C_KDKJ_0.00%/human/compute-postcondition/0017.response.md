The only variable in the loop head is `s`, which is iterated over the string `a`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next character in the string `a`.

Given:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'.
- `S` is `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]]` if `s` is '0', or `S` is `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2]]` if `s` is '1'.

At the end of the previous iteration, `s` was the current character from the string `a`. For the next iteration, `s` will be the next character in the string `a`.

Let's denote the current index of `s` in `a` as `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been the index of the current `s`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `s` should be the character at the new index `i` in `a`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only say that `s` will be the next character in the string `a`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `s` is the next character in the string `a`**
