The code snippet assigns `rsum` the value of `n - lsum`. The variables `n`, `lsum`, `ans`, `satisfy`, `left`, and `right` retain their initial values, while `rsum` is newly defined.

Given that `lsum` is `left + count_1`, and `left` is `S[i][0]`, the value of `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + count_1)`. The state of the array `S` and the values of `count_0`, `count_1`, `n`, `ans`, `satisfy`, `left`, and `right` are unchanged.

Output State: **`[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], ..., [count_0, count_1]]; ans` is 0; `satisfy` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `left + count_1`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + count_1)`**.
