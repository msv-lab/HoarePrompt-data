The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are not affected by this line of code, and they remain as described in the initial state. 

Output State: **Each test case consists of three integers k, x, and a, where 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. There are `t` test cases, where `t` is an input integer.**
