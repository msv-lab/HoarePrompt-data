Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the output state after the execution of the code.

Initial State:
- `k` is the first integer from the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the input and must be at least -1.
- `a` is the third integer from the input.
- `z` is 2 + z // (k - 1).
- `i` is 2.

Code Snippet:
```python
z += z // (k - 1) + 1
```

Let's calculate the new value of `z` after the code execution.

The initial value of `z` is given as `2 + z // (k - 1)`. Let's denote this initial value of `z` as `z_initial`. Therefore, we have:
\[ z_{\text{initial}} = 2 + \frac{z_{\text{initial}}}{k - 1} \]

Now, the code snippet modifies `z` as follows:
\[ z = z + \frac{z}{k - 1} + 1 \]

Substituting the initial value of `z` into the equation, we get:
\[ z = z_{\text{initial}} + \frac{z_{\text{initial}}}{k - 1} + 1 \]
\[ z = \left(2 + \frac{z_{\text{initial}}}{k - 1}\right) + \frac{z_{\text{initial}}}{k - 1} + 1 \]
\[ z = 2 + \frac{z_{\text{initial}}}{k - 1} + \frac{z_{\text{initial}}}{k - 1} + 1 \]
\[ z = 3 + \frac{2 \cdot z_{\text{initial}}}{k - 1} \]

Since the initial value of `z` is `2 + z // (k - 1)`, we can express the new value of `z` directly in terms of the initial value and the input `k`.

Thus, the new value of `z` is:
\[ z = 3 + \frac{2 \cdot z_{\text{initial}}}{k - 1} \]

The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be at least -1, `a` is the third integer from the input, `z` is 3 + 2 * (2 + z // (k - 1)) // (k - 1), `i` is 2.**
