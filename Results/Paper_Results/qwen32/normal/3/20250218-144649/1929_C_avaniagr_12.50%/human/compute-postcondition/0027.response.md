The initial state provides us with several conditions and definitions of variables:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers derived from the input.
- `x` is at least 0.
- `z` is defined conditionally based on the value of `k`:
  - If `k > 2`, then `z = 2^(x+1) - 1`.
  - If `k = 2`, then `z = 2x + 1`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

The code snippet provided is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement outputs the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `z`. The condition that `a` is greater than or equal to `z` does not affect the output of the `print` statement directly.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **YES**
