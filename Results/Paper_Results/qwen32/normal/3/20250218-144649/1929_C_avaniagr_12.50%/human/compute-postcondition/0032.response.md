Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, and `a` is the third integer from the input. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then `a` retains its value if it is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, otherwise `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` equals `k - 1`, `a` can be either greater than or equal to `x + 3` or less than `x + 3`. Otherwise, `a` can be either greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`, where `z` is `2^(x+1) - 1` if `k > 2` or `2x + 1` if `k = 2`.**
