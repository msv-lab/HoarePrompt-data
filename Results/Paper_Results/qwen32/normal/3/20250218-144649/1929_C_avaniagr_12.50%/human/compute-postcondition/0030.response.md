Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and is at least 0, `a` is the third integer from the input, `z` is `2^(x+1) - 1` if `k > 2` or `2x + 1` if `k = 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` remains greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.**
