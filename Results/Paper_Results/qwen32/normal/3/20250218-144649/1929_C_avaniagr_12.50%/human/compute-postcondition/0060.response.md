Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers as read from the input; `t` must be greater than 0. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition is satisfied and no changes are made to `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied and no changes are made to `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`. In both cases, the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged.**
