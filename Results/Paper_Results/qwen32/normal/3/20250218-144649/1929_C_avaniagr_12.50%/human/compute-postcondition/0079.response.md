To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop, we need to consider the logic of the loop and how it processes each test case. The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`, and then decides whether to print "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions provided.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the behavior of the loop for all iterations. The loop logic is as follows:

1. If `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
2. If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 3`. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
3. If `x > k - 1`, it calculates `z` based on the value of `k`:
   - If `k > 2`, `z` is calculated as `2^(x + 1) - 1`.
   - If `k = 2`, `z` is calculated as `x + 1`.
   It then checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Since the output state after the first 3 iterations does not change the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` except for the specific conditions mentioned, we can infer that the loop will process each test case independently and print "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions.

After all iterations, the state of the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` will revert to their initial values for the next test case, and `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0. The only change will be the printed output ("YES" or "NO") for each test case.

Therefore, the output state after all the executions of the loop will be:

Output State: **The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `t` are as they were initially, except `t` is now 0.**

In simpler terms, the loop will have finished processing all test cases, and the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` will be in their initial state, with `t` being 0, indicating no more test cases to process.
