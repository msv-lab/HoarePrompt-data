The code snippet updates the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` by reading from the input. The initial state specifies the ranges for these variables, but after the code execution, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will be whatever integers are provided in the input, as long as they fall within the specified ranges.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the third integer from the input**.
