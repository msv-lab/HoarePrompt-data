The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`), but these variables are not used within the `print` statement. Therefore, their specific values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is the first integer from the input.
   - `x` is the second integer from the input and is equal to `k - 1`.
   - `a` is the third integer from the input and is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement is executed, which outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, or `a`, their values do not influence the output.

**Output**: **YES**
