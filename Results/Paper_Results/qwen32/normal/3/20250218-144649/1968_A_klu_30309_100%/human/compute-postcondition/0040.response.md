The given code snippet calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` and assigns it to `gcd_val`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `max_sum`, `best_y`, `current_sum`, and `y`) are not directly modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to the current value of `y` that resulted in `current_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. `y` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.**

In simpler terms, `gcd_val` is now the GCD of `x` and `y`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
