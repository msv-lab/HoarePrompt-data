Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` must have at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `max_sum` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, and `results`) remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet.
