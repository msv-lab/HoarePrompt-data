The code snippet calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` and assigns it to `gcd_val`. However, the variable `y` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `y` is meant to be `best_y` (as it's the only other integer variable mentioned in the context), we'll proceed with that assumption.

Given that `best_y` is 1 and `x` is at least 2, the GCD of `x` and `best_y` will always be 1 because the GCD of any number and 1 is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases` with an additional `1` appended, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `gcd_val` is 1.**
