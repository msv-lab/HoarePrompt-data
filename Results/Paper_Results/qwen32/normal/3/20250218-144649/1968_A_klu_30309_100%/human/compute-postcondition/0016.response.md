Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y`, `x` is at least 2, `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that `best_y` is now equal to `y`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
