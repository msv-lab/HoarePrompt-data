The only variables in the loop head are `y`, `x`, and the range parameters. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `x - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, which means `x` must be at least 2.

The variables `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

To ensure the loop executes, `x` must be at least 2. The variable `y` is initialized to `x - 1` at the start of the loop, so we don't need to set it before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `x` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` must have at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is at least 2**
