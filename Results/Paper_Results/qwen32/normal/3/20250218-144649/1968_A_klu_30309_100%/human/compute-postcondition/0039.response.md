The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y`. The loop iterates from `x - 1` down to `1`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` has been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was some value.
- The loop runs from `x - 1` down to `1`.

If `y` is currently `y_current`, then for the next iteration, `y` should be `y_current - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to the current value of `y` that resulted in `current_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. `y` is `y_current - 1`**.

To be more precise, if we denote the `y` at the end of the previous iteration as `y_prev`, then the state at the start of the next iteration would have `y` as `y_prev - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to the current value of `y` that resulted in `current_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. `y` is `y_prev - 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `y_prev`, we can generalize it as `y` being decremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to the current value of `y` that resulted in `current_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. `y` is decremented by 1 from its previous value**.

For clarity, let's denote the previous value of `y` as `y_prev`. The state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to the current value of `y` that resulted in `current_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. `y` is `y_prev - 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `y_prev`, we can simply state that `y` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to the current value of `y` that resulted in `current_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. `y` is decremented by 1 from its previous value**.

To be clear and concise:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to the current value of `y` that resulted in `current_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. `y` is decremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Final Answer:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 2 elements, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to the current value of `y` that resulted in `current_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged. `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. `y` is decremented by 1 from its previous value**.
