The only variable in the loop head is `y`. According to the code, the loop decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration, starting from `x - 1` down to `1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `y` has been decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `y` should be one more than its current value (which is `y - 1` at the end of the previous iteration).

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and `test_cases` has at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `x` is at least 2, `y` is `y`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Note that `y` is now the value it should be at the start of the next iteration, which is `y + 1` from the previous state. However, since we are describing the state at the start of the next iteration, we simply state `y` as it will be used in that iteration.
