You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 5) representing the number of problems in the bank and the number of upcoming rounds, respectively. Following these integers is a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G' representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in its implementation. Specifically, the code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for the upcoming rounds. The issue lies in the way it calculates the number of additional problems required for each difficulty level.

Let's analyze the problem and the code:

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   - Vlad needs `m` rounds, and each round requires one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - Therefore, for `m` rounds, Vlad needs `m` problems of each difficulty level.
   - The program should count how many problems of each level Vlad already has and determine how many more he needs to create to meet the requirement of `m` problems for each level.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string.
   - It then iterates over the dictionary keys and checks if the count of problems for each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m`.
   - If the count is less than or equal to `m`, it adds `m - count` to the answer.

3. **Logical Error:**
   - The condition `if d[val] <= m` is incorrect. It should be `if d[val] < m` because Vlad needs exactly `m` problems for each difficulty level, not just up to `m`.
   - Additionally, the function `default_value` is not defined in the provided code, which would cause a `NameError` if the code were to run.

4. **Example of Incorrect Output:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     10 1
     BGECDCBDED
     ```
   - The program should output `2` because Vlad needs one problem of difficulty 'A' and one problem of difficulty 'F'.
   - However, the program will incorrectly calculate the answer because of the logic error mentioned above.

To fix the program, the condition should be corrected to `if d[val] < m`, and the `default_value` function should be properly defined or removed if not needed. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def default_value():
    return 0

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(default_value)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans = ans + m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version will properly calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case.
