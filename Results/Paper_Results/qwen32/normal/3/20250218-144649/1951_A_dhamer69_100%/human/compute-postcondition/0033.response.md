Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new input string; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `s.count('11') == 1` and `count_1 == 2`, then the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, the conditions remain as specified.**
