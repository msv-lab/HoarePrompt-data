Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new input string. If `s` is '00', then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.**
