Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. It then checks specific conditions based on the value of `n` and the content of `s` to determine if it should print 'YES' or 'NO'. If `n` is 2, it prints 'YES' only if `s` is '00'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' if the number of '1's in `s` is even and not both conditions `count_1 == 2` and `s.count('11') == 1` are satisfied; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process `t` times.**
