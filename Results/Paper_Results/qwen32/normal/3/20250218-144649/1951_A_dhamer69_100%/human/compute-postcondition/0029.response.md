The code snippet `count_1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. This operation does not affect the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, and `n`. The only variable that changes is `count_1`, which is assigned the count of '1's in the string `s`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new input string; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.**
