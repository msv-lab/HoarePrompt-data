Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new input string. If `n` is not equal to 2, `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, specific actions of the if block are taken (which are not detailed here). Otherwise, if `s.count('11') == 1` and `count_1 == 2`, specific actions of the if block are taken; otherwise, the variables retain their initial conditions. If `n` is equal to 2, the variables retain their initial conditions.**
