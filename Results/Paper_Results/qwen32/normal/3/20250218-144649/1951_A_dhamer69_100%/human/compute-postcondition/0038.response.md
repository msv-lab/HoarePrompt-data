Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new input string. If `n` is 2 and `s` is '00', the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged except `t` is now 1. Otherwise, `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged regardless of the value of `s` except `t` is now 1. Additionally, if `n` is not 2, `count_1` (the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`) is evaluated: if `count_1` is odd, no additional changes occur. If `count_1` is even and `s` contains exactly one occurrence of '11' with `count_1` equal to 2, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.**

Explanation: The only change is that `n` is now assigned the value of the input integer. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as per the initial state.
