The `print('NO')` statement in the provided code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string 'NO', regardless of the values of the other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `count_1`) mentioned in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `count_1`), but none of these variables are used within the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement explicitly outputs the string 'NO'.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
