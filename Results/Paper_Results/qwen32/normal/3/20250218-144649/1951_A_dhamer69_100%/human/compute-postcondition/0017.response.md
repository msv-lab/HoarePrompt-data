Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2; `s` is an input string; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`, and `count_1` is even. Additionally, either `s.count('11')` is not equal to 1 or `count_1` is not equal to 2.**
