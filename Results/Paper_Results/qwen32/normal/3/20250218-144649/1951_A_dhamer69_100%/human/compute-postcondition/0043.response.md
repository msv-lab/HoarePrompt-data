The code snippet assigns `count_1` the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new input string; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.**
