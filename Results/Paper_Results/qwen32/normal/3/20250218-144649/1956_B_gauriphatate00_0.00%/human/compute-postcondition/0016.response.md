The code snippet provided increments the value of `idx` by `n`. Therefore, the value of `idx` changes from `3 + n` to `3 + 2n`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, `t`, and `results`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[idx - n])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 2n`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`**.
