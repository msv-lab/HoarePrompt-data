Output State: **`n` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx - n - 1:idx - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 2n + 1`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**

Natural Language: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so `idx` becomes `3 + 2n + 1`. The values of `n`, `a`, `data`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged from the initial state.
