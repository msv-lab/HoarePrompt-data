Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given that Nene always plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. The key to the solution lies in the distribution of pairs of cards and how they are played.

The provided solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, a)`: This function calculates the maximum number of points you can get.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input, processes it, and prints the results.

#### Function `func_1(n, a)`

- It uses `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
- It calculates the number of pairs (`pairs`) of cards you have.
- The function returns `min(pairs, n // 2)`, which represents the maximum number of points you can get.

#### Function `func_2()`

- It reads input from standard input.
- It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
- It prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness

The logic in `func_1` is based on the observation that:
- If you have a pair of cards, you can get a point if Nene places the other card on the table before you.
- Since Nene plays optimally, she will try to minimize your points. However, she can't prevent you from scoring if you have pairs of cards.
- The maximum number of points you can get is the minimum of the number of pairs you have and half the total number of cards you have (`n // 2`), because you can only make `n // 2` moves.

### Verification

Let's verify the function with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `4`, `1 1 2 3`
   - Pairs: `1`
   - Output: `min(1, 4 // 2) = 1`
   - This matches the expected output.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `8`, `7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5`
   - Pairs: `3`
   - Output: `min(3, 8 // 2) = 3`
   - However, the expected output is `2`. This suggests that the function does not correctly account for Nene's optimal play to minimize your score.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `8`, `7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6`
   - Pairs: `2`
   - Output: `min(2, 8 // 2) = 2`
   - However, the expected output is `1`. This suggests that the function does not correctly account for Nene's optimal play to minimize your score.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `3`, `1 2 3`
   - Pairs: `0`
   - Output: `min(0, 3 // 2) = 0`
   - This matches the expected output.

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `1`, `1`
   - Pairs: `0`
   - Output: `min(0, 1 // 2) = 0`
   - This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` does not correctly account for Nene's optimal play to minimize your score in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` only considers the number of pairs you have and the number of moves you can make, but it does not account for Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your score. This can lead to incorrect results in some cases, as demonstrated by the second and third test cases.
