### Reasoning:

To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's re-examine the problem description, the code, and the function summaries.

#### Problem Analysis:

- **Game Setup**: Each player receives `n` cards from a deck of `2n` cards where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice.
- **Objective**: Maximize your points by placing cards on the table, scoring a point if the card has already been placed.
- **Constraints**: Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

#### Key Observations:

1. **Pairs of Cards**: There are `n` pairs of cards.
2. **Turns**: Each player takes `n` turns.
3. **Optimal Play**: Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

#### Strategy:

- **Your Optimal Play**: You should aim to place cards that have already been placed by Nene.
- **Nene's Optimal Play**: Nene will aim to place cards in such a way that she scores points and prevents you from scoring points.

#### Calculation:

- **Pairs in Your Hand**: Count the number of pairs in your hand (i.e., numbers that appear twice).
- **Maximum Points**: The maximum points you can score is the minimum of the number of pairs in your hand and `n//2`. This is because Nene can prevent you from scoring more than `n//2` points.

#### Program Analysis:

- **Function `func_1(n, a)`**:
  - Uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
  - Counts the number of pairs in your hand.
  - Returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n//2`.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - Reads input from standard input.
  - Processes each test case by calling `func_1(n, a)`.
  - Prints the result for each test case.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary for `func_2` correctly states that it reads multiple test cases from the standard input, processes each test case using `func_1(n, a)`, and prints the result for each test case.

#### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the strategy and logic described. It accurately calculates the maximum number of points you can get by considering the number of pairs in your hand and the constraint imposed by Nene's optimal play.

### Final Evaluation:

The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the analysis.

Final: **True**
