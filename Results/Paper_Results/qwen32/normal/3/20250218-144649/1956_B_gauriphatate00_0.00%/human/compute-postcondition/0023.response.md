The code snippet appends the result of `func_1(n, a)` to the `results` list. The values of `n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, and `t` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[idx - 1 - n])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 3n + 1`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains as `int(data[idx - 1 - n])`. The list `a` of `n` integers derived from `data[idx - n:idx]` is unchanged. The list `data`, which is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, remains the same. The value of `idx`, which is `3 + 3n + 1`, is unchanged. The value of `t`, which is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, remains unchanged. The `results` list now contains the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and a new result of `func_1(n, a)`.
