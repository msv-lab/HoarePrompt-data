The only variable in the loop head is `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the loop in terms of its continuation. However, the loop's continuation depends on the variable `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer value equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0. Since the loop iterates `t` times, after each iteration, `t` effectively decreases by 1 implicitly (though it's not explicitly shown in the loop head).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, `results`) do not need to be adjusted according to the loop head.

State: **`n` is `int(data[1])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`**
