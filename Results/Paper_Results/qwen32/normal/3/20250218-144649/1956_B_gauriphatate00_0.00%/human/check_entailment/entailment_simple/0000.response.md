### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and ensure that it aligns with the problem requirements. The problem involves a card game where each player has `n` cards, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice among the `2n` cards. Players take turns placing cards on a table, and a player scores a point if they place a card that matches a card already on the table.

The key observation here is that the maximum number of points you can score is determined by the number of pairs of cards you have in your hand. If you have `k` pairs in your hand, you can potentially score `k` points if Nene does not interfere optimally. However, since Nene plays optimally to minimize your score and maximize her own, you can only score up to `min(k, n // 2)` points because Nene can block your attempts to score more than `n // 2` points by placing her cards strategically.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates this by counting the number of pairs in your hand (`pairs`) and then returning the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`. This ensures that you only score as many points as possible given Nene's optimal play.

The function `func_2` handles the input parsing and result collection, calling `func_1` for each test case and printing the results.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem based on the given requirements and constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
