The value of `idx` is incremented by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `int(data[idx - 1 - n])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx - n:idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `3 + 3n + 1`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`.
