The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of `n` and `cnt` do not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted. The variable `i` is the loop variable and is initialized by the `range` function, so it does not need to be set before the loop starts.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1**
