Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions. Let's break down the problem and the code to identify the issues.

### Problem Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) but seems to have incorrect logic.

### Issues in `func_2`:
The logic in `func_2` is incorrect and does not properly count the valid pairs. The formula used inside the loop:
```python
x = n - (i * i - i)
y = i * i
cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
```
does not align with the problem's requirements. It seems to be an attempt to calculate the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\), but the formula is not derived from the problem's conditions.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds.

### Example of Correct Implementation:
Here's a simple and correct way to implement the solution, which checks each pair \((a, b)\) directly:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_2(n, m):
    return count_valid_pairs(n, m)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\). Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
