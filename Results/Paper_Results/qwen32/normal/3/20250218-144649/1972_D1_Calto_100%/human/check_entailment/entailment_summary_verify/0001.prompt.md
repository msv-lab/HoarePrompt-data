You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

    4
    14

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `m`. It calculates and returns the sum of the expression `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all integer values of `i` from 1 to `m`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Program Explanation
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This is correct and matches the standard implementation of the GCD function.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.

### Analysis of `func_2(n, m)`
The function `func_2(n, m)` has the following code:
```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt
```

Let's analyze this function in detail:
- `cnt` is initialized to `-1`. This seems incorrect because we should start counting from `0`.
- The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `m`.
- For each `i`, it calculates `x` and `y`:
  - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
  - `y = i * i`
- It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

### Correctness of the Formula
The logic inside the loop does not seem to correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the conditions and the formula used do not match the problem statement.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to check for each pair \((a, b)\) if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done with nested loops iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition.

### Conclusion
Given the provided code, it does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
