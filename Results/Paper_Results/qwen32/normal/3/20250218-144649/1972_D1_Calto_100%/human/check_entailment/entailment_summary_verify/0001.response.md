### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Code Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
   - It is not used in `func_2`, so we can ignore it for this problem.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.
   - The function initializes `cnt` to `-1`, which is incorrect. It should start counting from `0`.
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `m`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
   - It then updates `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

#### Evaluation of `func_2(n, m)`

To understand whether `func_2` correctly implements the problem's requirements, we need to compare its logic with the problem statement.

The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be written as:
\[ a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]

This can be simplified to:
\[ a \equiv -b \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]

The provided code does not directly check this condition. Instead, it calculates `x` and `y` and uses these to update `cnt`. This approach does not seem to directly correspond to the problem's requirements.

#### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. A correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
def func_2_correct(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

This nested loop approach directly checks the condition for each pair \((a, b)\).

#### Conclusion

Given the provided code, it does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The function `func_2` uses a different formula and approach that does not correspond to the problem's requirements.
