The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `m` remains the same.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

The variables `n`, `m`, `cnt`, `x`, and `y` are not part of the loop head, so they should not be adjusted directly. However, we need to ensure that the expressions involving `i` are correctly updated.

Given:
- `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`
- `y` is `i * i`
- `cnt` is `-1 + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i_prev + 1`
- `m` remains the same
- `x` will be recalculated as `n - ((i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1) - (i_prev + 1))`
- `y` will be recalculated as `(i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1)`
- `cnt` will be recalculated based on the new values of `x` and `y`

However, since the task specifies that we only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we only need to adjust `i`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0), `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `i * i`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**
