The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those for the next iteration of the loop. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` at the beginning of the next iteration will be `i + 1`.

Since `m` is the upper limit of the loop and does not change during the iterations, it remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is updated to `cnt + math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / ((i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1))) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % ((i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1)) == 0); `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `(i_prev + 1) * (i_prev + 1)`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
