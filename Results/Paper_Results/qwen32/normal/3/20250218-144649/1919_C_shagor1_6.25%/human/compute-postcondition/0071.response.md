Output State: **`x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp`, `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` greater than both `x` and `y`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer input, but the values of `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they were already defined in the initial state.
