The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `a`; `ans` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is greater than `x` and `a` is greater than `y`.**
