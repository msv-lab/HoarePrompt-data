The value of `x` is assigned the value of `a`, where `a` is the next integer in the list `inp`. The values of `inp`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the next integer in `inp`, and `x` is equal to `a`.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the next integer in `inp`, `x` is equal to `a`.**
