The value of `x` is updated to be equal to `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `x` now holds the value of `a`, which is less than or equal to `x` (the previous value of `x` which was `n + 1`). The values of `inp`, `y`, `ans`, `n`, and the condition that `a` is less than or equal to `x` (now `a` is less than or equal to `a`) are still valid.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `a`; `y` is `n + 1`; `ans` is 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is less than or equal to `x`.**
