In the provided for loop, the loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable that we don't need to adjust its value explicitly since it's not used in the loop body. Instead, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is correctly set to `t` so that the loop executes the correct number of times.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that will allow the loop to execute. Since `t` is already described as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we don't need to adjust `t` itself, but we need to ensure that the input function will correctly interpret `t` as the number of iterations.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the input function will provide `t` as the number of iterations for the loop.**

Since the loop head only involves the variable `_` and the range function, and since the range function will use the value of `t` from the input, the state of `t` is the only relevant state to consider for ensuring the loop executes correctly.
