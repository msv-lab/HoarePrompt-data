Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `x` is the next element in `inp`; `y` is `a`; `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1` and `ans` is 2 if `a` is greater than `n + 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the next element in `inp`.**

In simple terms, the value of `x` is now updated to be the next element in the list `inp`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
