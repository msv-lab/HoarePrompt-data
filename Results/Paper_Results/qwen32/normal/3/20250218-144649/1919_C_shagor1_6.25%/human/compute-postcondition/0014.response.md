The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `inp`, `x`, `y`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `a`; `ans` is `1`; and `a` is greater than `y`.**
