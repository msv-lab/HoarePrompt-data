To determine the output, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `x` is the smallest value in the list `inp`.
2. `y` is the second smallest distinct value in the list `inp`.
3. `ans` is the count of elements in the list `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
- **`x`**: This is the smallest element in the list `inp`.
- **`y`**: This is the second smallest distinct element in the list `inp`. It means that `y` is the smallest element that is greater than `x`.
- **`ans`**: This variable holds the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

### What is printed:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

Since the exact elements of `inp` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `ans`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **ans (where ans is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`)**
