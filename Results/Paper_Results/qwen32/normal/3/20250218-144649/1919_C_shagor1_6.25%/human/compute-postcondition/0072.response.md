The provided code snippet assigns the input values to the list `inp` after converting them from strings to integers. This operation overwrites any previous value that `inp` might have had. The variables `x`, `y`, and `ans` are not affected by this line of code, and their values remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp`, `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` greater than both `x` and `y`, `n` is an input integer.**
