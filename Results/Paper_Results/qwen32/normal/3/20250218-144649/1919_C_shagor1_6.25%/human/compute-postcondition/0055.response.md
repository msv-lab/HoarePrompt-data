The given code snippet `x == y` is a comparison operation, which evaluates to a boolean value (`True` or `False`) but does not assign this result to any variable or alter the values of `x` or `y`. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, `ans`, `n`, `a`, and `inp` remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements; `x` is `a` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `x` remains `n + 1`; `y` is `n + 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is `a`; `ans` is 0 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the next element in `inp`.**
