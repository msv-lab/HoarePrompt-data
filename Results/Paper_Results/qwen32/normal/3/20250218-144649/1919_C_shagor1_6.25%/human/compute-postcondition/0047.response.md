The code snippet `x == y` is a comparison and does not change the values of `x` or `y`. It simply evaluates to `True` or `False` based on whether `x` is equal to `y`. Since the values of `x` and `y` are not altered, the state of the variables remains the same as the initial state. The comparison result is not stored or used anywhere in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `n + 1`; `ans` is 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is greater than `x` and `a` is greater than `y`**
