The code snippet assigns the value of `num % y` to `r_y`. The variable `num` is not defined in the initial state, so we can assume `num` is a variable that holds a specific value in the context of the code execution, possibly from the test case tuple. Since `num` is not provided, we can't determine its specific value, but we can express `r_y` in terms of `num` and `y`.

The other variables like `test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `residue_map`, `arr`, and `r_x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case, where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, arr) with 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and arr is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one integer; `r_x` is `-arr[0] % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`.**
