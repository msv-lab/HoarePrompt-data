The code snippet provided updates the value of `r_y` by recalculating it as `num % y`. Given that `num` is equal to `arr[2]`, the new value of `r_y` will be `arr[2] % y`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least three integers; `r_x` is `-arr[2] % x`; `r_y` is `arr[2] % y`; `current_key` is `(arr[2] % x, arr[2] % y)`; `residue_map` is `{(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y): 1, (arr[1] % x, arr[1] % y): 1}`; `num` is `arr[2]`.**
