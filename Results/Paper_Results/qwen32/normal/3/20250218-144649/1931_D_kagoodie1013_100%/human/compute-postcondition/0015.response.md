The code increments the count of the `current_key` in the `residue_map` dictionary. Initially, `residue_map` contains one entry with the key `(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y)` and the value `1`. The `current_key` is `(arr[1] % x, arr[1] % y)`, and since this key is not initially in `residue_map`, it is added with a value of `1`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least two integers; `r_x` is `-arr[1] % x`; `r_y` is `arr[1] % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `residue_map` is `{(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y): 1, (arr[1] % x, arr[1] % y): 1}`; `num` is `arr[1]`.**
