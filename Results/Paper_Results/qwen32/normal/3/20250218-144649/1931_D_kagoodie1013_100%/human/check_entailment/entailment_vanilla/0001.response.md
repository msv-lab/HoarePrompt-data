Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to find pairs of indices (i, j) in the array such that:
1. \( a_i + a_j \) is divisible by \( x \).
2. \( a_i - a_j \) is divisible by \( y \).

### Conditions Analysis:
Let's restate the conditions in terms of modular arithmetic:
1. \( a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ x) \) which implies \( a_i \equiv -a_j \ (\text{mod} \ x) \).
2. \( a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ y) \) which implies \( a_i \equiv a_j \ (\text{mod} \ y) \).

This means for a pair (i, j) to be beautiful:
- \( a_i \equiv -a_j \ (\text{mod} \ x) \)
- \( a_i \equiv a_j \ (\text{mod} \ y) \)

### Program Analysis:
The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues:
- `r_x` is the residue of `-num` modulo `x`.
- `r_y` is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.

For each number `num` in the array:
- It calculates `r_x` and `r_y`.
- It checks how many pairs `(r_x, r_y)` have been seen before and adds this count to the total number of beautiful pairs.
- It then updates the `residue_map` with the current residue pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs. Here's why:
- It correctly calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y` for each number.
- It uses a dictionary to keep track of the counts of these residue pairs, which allows it to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs as it iterates through the array.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating through the test cases and processing each one independently.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
