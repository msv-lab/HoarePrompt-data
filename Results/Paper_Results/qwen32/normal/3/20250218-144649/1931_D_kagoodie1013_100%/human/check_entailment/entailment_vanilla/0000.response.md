Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find pairs \((i, j)\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\)
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)

2. **Mathematical Reformulation**:
   - For \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by \(x\), we need:
     \[
     (a_i + a_j) \mod x = 0 \implies a_i \mod x + a_j \mod x = x \mod x \implies a_i \mod x + a_j \mod x = 0 \mod x
     \]
     This means \(a_i \mod x\) and \(a_j \mod x\) must sum up to \(x\) modulo \(x\), i.e., \(a_i \mod x + a_j \mod x = 0\) or \(a_i \mod x + a_j \mod x = x\).
   - For \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), we need:
     \[
     (a_i - a_j) \mod y = 0 \implies a_i \mod y = a_j \mod y
     \]

3. **Using Residues**:
   - We use the residues of the array elements modulo \(x\) and \(y\). Specifically, for each element \(a_i\), we consider the pair \((a_i \mod x, a_i \mod y)\).
   - For a pair \((i, j)\) to be beautiful, the residues must satisfy:
     - \(a_i \mod x + a_j \mod x = 0 \mod x\) or \(a_i \mod x + a_j \mod x = x\)
     - \(a_i \mod y = a_j \mod y\)

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - We can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each residue pair \((a_i \mod x, a_i \mod y)\).
   - For each element \(a_i\), we check how many previous elements have the required residues to form a beautiful pair with \(a_i\).

5. **Implementation Details**:
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `residue_map` to count the occurrences of residue pairs.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the required residues and checks the dictionary to count pairs.
   - It updates the dictionary with the current element's residue pair.

### Checking the Program:

- The program correctly calculates the residues modulo \(x\) and \(y\) for each element.
- It uses a dictionary to keep track of the count of each residue pair.
- It correctly updates the count of beautiful pairs based on the residue conditions.
- The program efficiently processes multiple test cases within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
