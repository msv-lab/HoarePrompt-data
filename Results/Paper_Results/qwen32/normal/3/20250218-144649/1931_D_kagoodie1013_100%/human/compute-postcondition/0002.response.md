The code snippet initializes a variable `count` to 0. No other variables are affected. The `test_cases` list and `results` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case, where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, arr) with 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and arr is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0.**
