Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case, where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, arr) with 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and arr is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    r_x = -num % x
    r_y = num % y
    count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
    current_key = num % x, num % y
    residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one integer; `r_x` is `-arr[0] % x`; `r_y` is `arr[0] % y`; `current_key` is `(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y)`; `residue_map` is `{(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y): 1}`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least two integers; `r_x` is `-arr[1] % x`; `r_y` is `arr[1] % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `residue_map` is `{(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y): 1, (arr[1] % x, arr[1] % y): 1}`; `num` is `arr[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case; `results` is an empty list; `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least three integers; `r_x` is `-arr[2] % x`; `r_y` is `arr[2] % y`; `current_key` is `(arr[2] % x, arr[2] % y)`; `residue_map` is `{(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y): 1, (arr[1] % x, arr[1] % y): 1, (arr[2] % x, arr[2] % y): 1}` if `current_key` was not in `residue_map` initially, or `{(arr[0] % x, arr[0] % y): 1, (arr[1] % x, arr[1] % y): 1, (arr[2] % x, arr[2] % y): 2}` if `current_key` was already in `residue_map` with a value of 1; `num` is `arr[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
