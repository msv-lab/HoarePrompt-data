The code snippet provided is `r_x = -num % x`. However, there is no variable `num` defined in the initial state. It seems like there might be a typo or missing context. Assuming `num` is intended to be one of the variables from the initial state, let's consider `num` to be the first element of the list `arr` from the first test case in `test_cases`, as it is the only integer list provided. 

Given this assumption, let's proceed with the calculation:

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case, where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, arr) with 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and arr is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one integer.

Let's assume `num` is `arr[0]`.

The code `r_x = -num % x` calculates the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case, where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, arr) with 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and arr is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one integer; `r_x` is `-arr[0] % x`.**

In natural language: The output state remains the same as the initial state except that a new variable `r_x` is introduced, which holds the value of `-arr[0] % x`.
