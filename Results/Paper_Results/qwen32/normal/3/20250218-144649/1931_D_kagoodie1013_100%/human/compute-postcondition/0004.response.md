In the given for loop, the loop variable is `num` and it iterates over the list `arr`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `arr` must contain at least one element. The other variables mentioned (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, and `residue_map`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution and thus do not need adjustment for the loop to start.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Variable (`num`)**: This variable is assigned values from the list `arr` during each iteration. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element.
2. **List `arr`**: This is the list over which the loop iterates. Since `arr` is part of the tuples in `test_cases`, we need to ensure that `test_cases` contains at least one tuple, and that tuple must contain a non-empty `arr`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `arr` is a non-empty list of integers. Given that `test_cases` must contain at least one test case, we can ensure that `arr` is non-empty by selecting the first test case and using its `arr` component.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one test case, where each test case is a tuple (n, x, y, arr) with 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and arr is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` is the list of integers from the first test case in `test_cases` and must contain at least one integer**
