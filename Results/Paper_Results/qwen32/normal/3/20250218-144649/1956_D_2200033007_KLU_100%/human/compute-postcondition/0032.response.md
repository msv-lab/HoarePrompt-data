Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[j]` is `i` for all `j` in the range from `start_index` to `start_index + i`, `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` and the results of `make_stairs(i - 1)`**

The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, and the state of the variables remains as described in the initial state except that the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been executed. The results of this function call are included in the `res` list. No other variables have been modified.
