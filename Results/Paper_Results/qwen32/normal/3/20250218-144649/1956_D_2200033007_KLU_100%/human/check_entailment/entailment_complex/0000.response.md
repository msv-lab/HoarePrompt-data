### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and its functions against the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: To calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the allowed operations.
   - **Approach**: It uses dynamic programming with memoization to store results of subproblems (`res_dict`). It considers all possible ways to split the array into subarrays and calculates the maximum sum by either keeping the current element or merging it with adjacent elements.
   - **Correctness**: The function seems to correctly calculate the maximum sum by considering all possible splits and merges, and it uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: To construct the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum.
   - **Approach**: It recursively determines the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`. It checks all possible splits and merges and constructs the list of operations accordingly.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly identifies the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum by recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and combining their solutions.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - **Purpose**: To make a subarray into a "staircase" pattern, where each element `arr[start_index + j]` equals `j`.
   - **Approach**: It recursively ensures that each element in the subarray matches its index. If an element does not match, it performs the necessary operations and updates the array.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly updates the array to form a staircase pattern and appends the necessary operations to the result list.

4. **Main Execution**:
   - **Purpose**: To read input, call the functions, and print the results.
   - **Approach**: It reads the input array, calls `func_1` to get the maximum sum, calls `func_2` to get the sequence of operations, and prints the results.
   - **Correctness**: The main execution correctly orchestrates the process by calling the necessary functions and printing the results as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem by calculating the maximum possible sum and constructing the sequence of operations to achieve it. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` work together to solve the problem efficiently.

**Correctness: True**
