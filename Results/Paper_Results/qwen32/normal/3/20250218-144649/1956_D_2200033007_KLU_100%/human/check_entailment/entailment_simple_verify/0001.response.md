### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotations.

#### Function 1: `func_1(start_index: int, end_index: int) -> int`

- **Purpose**: Computes the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` after performing the allowed operations.
- **Memoization**: Uses `res_dict` to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Logic**:
  - If the subarray consists of a single element, it returns the maximum of 1 or the element itself.
  - It considers filling the entire subarray with the maximum possible MEX value (`(end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2`).
  - It recursively explores splitting the subarray at each possible position and calculates the sum.
  - It also considers extending the subarray by including the first or last element and calculating the sum recursively.

#### Function 2: `func_2(start_index: int, end_index: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]`

- **Purpose**: Generates the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum as computed by `func_1`.
- **Logic**:
  - Recursively constructs the sequence of operations by examining the same splits and conditions as `func_1`.
  - Calls `make_stairs` to fill the subarray with the MEX values when the optimal solution involves filling the entire subarray.

#### Function 3: `make_stairs(i: int) -> None`

- **Purpose**: Fills a subarray with the MEX values from 0 to `i`.
- **Logic**:
  - Checks if the subarray is already in the desired MEX form.
  - If not, it recursively fills the subarray by performing the necessary operations and updating the array.

### Issues Identified in the Code:

1. **Global Variables and Scope**:
   - The variable `arr` is used in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs`, but it is not defined within these functions. It should be passed as a parameter or defined globally.
   - The variable `res` is used in `func_2` and `make_stairs`, but it is not defined within these functions. It should be passed as a parameter or defined globally.
   - The variable `start_index` is used in `make_stairs` but is not defined within the function. It should be passed as a parameter.

2. **Incorrect Use of `start_index` in `make_stairs`**:
   - The variable `start_index` is used in `make_stairs` but is not defined within the function. It should be passed as a parameter.

3. **Logic for Constructing Operations**:
   - The logic for constructing the sequence of operations in `func_2` and `make_stairs` is not fully correct. It does not handle all cases correctly, especially when the optimal solution involves splitting the subarray.
   - The function `make_stairs` does not correctly handle the case when the subarray is not already in the desired MEX form.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases such as when the array is already in the optimal form or when the array has only one element.

### Evaluation Based on Annotations:

- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- However, the annotations do not address the issues with global variables and the incorrect handling of the `start_index` in `make_stairs`.
- The annotations also do not address the logic issues in `func_2` and `make_stairs`.

### Final Assessment:

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided code is not correct. It does not handle all cases correctly and lacks proper handling of global variables and scope.

**Final: False**
