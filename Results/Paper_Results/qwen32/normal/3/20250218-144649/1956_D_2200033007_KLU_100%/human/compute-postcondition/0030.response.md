Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[start_index]` is `i`, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`, `arr[start_index + i + 1]` (which is `arr[j]`) is now `i`, `arr[j]` for `j != start_index` and `j != start_index + i + 1` retains its previous value, `is_already_stairs` is False, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, `j` is `start_index + i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value at `arr[j]` (where `j` is `start_index + i + 1`) is now set to `i`. All other values in `arr` and other variables remain unchanged.
