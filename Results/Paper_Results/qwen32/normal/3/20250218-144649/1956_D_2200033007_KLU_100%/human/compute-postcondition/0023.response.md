The provided code snippet involves a function call `make_stairs(i - 1)`. Since the function `make_stairs` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine the exact changes it will make to the variables. However, based on the given initial state and the function call, we can infer that the function `make_stairs` will be executed with the argument `i - 1`.

Given that the function `make_stairs` is not defined, we assume that it might modify some of the variables, but without knowing its implementation, we can only state that the function has been called with the argument `i - 1`.

The variables `i`, `start_index`, `arr`, `is_already_stairs`, and the condition `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i` remain unchanged unless modified inside the `make_stairs` function.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `arr` is a list of integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.**
