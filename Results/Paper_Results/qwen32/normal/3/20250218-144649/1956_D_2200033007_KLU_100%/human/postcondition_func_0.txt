The function `func_1` calculates and returns a value based on a specified range within the array `arr` defined by the indices `start_index` and `end_index`. If the range is already computed and stored in the dictionary `res_dict`, it returns the stored value. If the range consists of a single element, it returns the maximum of 1 and the value of that element. Otherwise, it computes the maximum value by considering the square of the range length and the sum of the element values combined with recursive calculations of subranges. The result is stored in `res_dict` for future reference.
