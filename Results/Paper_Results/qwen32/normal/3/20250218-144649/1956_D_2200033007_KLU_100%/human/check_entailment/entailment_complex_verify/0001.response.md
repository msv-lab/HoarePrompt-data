### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided solution and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the array by performing a series of operations where each operation sets a subarray to its MEX value.
- The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.
- The operations can be performed up to \(5 \times 10^5\) times.

#### Analysis of the Code and Annotations:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(start_index: int, end_index: int) -> int`**
   - **Purpose**: Computes the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` after performing the allowed operations.
   - **Memoization**: Uses `res_dict` to store results of subproblems.
   - **Logic**: 
     - If the subarray is a single element, it returns the maximum of 1 or the element itself.
     - It considers filling the entire subarray with the maximum possible MEX value (`(end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2`).
     - It explores splitting the subarray at each possible position and calculates the sum recursively.
     - It considers extending the subarray by including the first or last element and calculating the sum recursively.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations match the described logic and confirm the function's behavior.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(start_index: int, end_index: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]`**
   - **Purpose**: Generates the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum as computed by `func_1`.
   - **Logic**:
     - Recursively constructs the sequence of operations by examining the same splits and conditions as `func_1`.
     - Calls `make_stairs` to fill the subarray with the MEX values when the optimal solution involves filling the entire subarray.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations match the described logic and confirm the function's behavior.

3. **Function 3: `make_stairs(i: int) -> None`**
   - **Purpose**: Fills a subarray with the MEX values from 0 to `i`.
   - **Logic**:
     - Checks if the subarray is already in the desired MEX form.
     - If not, it recursively fills the subarray by performing the necessary operations and updating the array.
   - **Annotations**: The annotations match the described logic and confirm the function's behavior.

#### Issues and Corrections:

1. **Global Variables and Scope**:
   - The variable `arr` is used in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs`, but it is not defined within these functions. It should be passed as a parameter or defined globally.
   - The variable `res` is used in `func_2` and `make_stairs`, but it is not defined within these functions. It should be passed as a parameter or defined globally.
   - The variable `start_index` is used in `make_stairs` but is not defined within the function. It should be passed as a parameter.

2. **Logic for Constructing Operations**:
   - The logic for constructing the sequence of operations in `func_2` and `make_stairs` seems to be incomplete or incorrect. The annotations do not provide enough detail to confirm the correctness of the operation construction.
   - The function `make_stairs` does not correctly handle the case when the subarray is not already in the desired MEX form.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases such as when the array is already in the optimal form or when the array has only one element.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations provide a good overview of the program's state and logic but do not address the issues with global variables, scope, and incomplete logic for constructing operations.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues mentioned above, particularly the improper handling of global variables and the incomplete logic for constructing the sequence of operations, the provided code is not correct. The annotations confirm the logic but do not address the critical issues with variable scope and operation construction.

**Final: False**
