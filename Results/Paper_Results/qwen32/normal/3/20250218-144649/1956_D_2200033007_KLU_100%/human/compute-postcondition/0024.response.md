The code appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to the list `res`. This operation modifies the list `res` by adding the new tuple to it. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `arr` is a list of integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`**.
