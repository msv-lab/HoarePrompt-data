The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the element of the list `arr` at the index `start_index`. This affects the value of `arr[start_index]` but does not change the values of any other variables. 

Output State: **`i` is 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` + `i` < len(`arr`), `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[start_index]` is 1, and `is_already_stairs` is False; `res` contains an additional tuple `(start_index, start_index)`**.
