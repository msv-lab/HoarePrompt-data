Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
- `n` is an input integer, and `n` is even.
- `s` is the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is less than 200.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `s`. The statement directly prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
