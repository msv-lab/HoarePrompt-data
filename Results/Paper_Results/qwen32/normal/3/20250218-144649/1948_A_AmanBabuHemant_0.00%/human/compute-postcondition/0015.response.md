The code snippet provided is:
```
n = int(input())
```

This line of code takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 49 and `n` is an input integer. The conditions related to the value of `n` (whether it is odd or even) and the subsequent creation of the string `s` are not affected by this line of code because the input operation only updates the value of `n`.

Since the value of `t` is not changed and the conditions for `s` depend on the new value of `n` which is obtained from the input, we only update `n` in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 49; `n` is the input integer.**
