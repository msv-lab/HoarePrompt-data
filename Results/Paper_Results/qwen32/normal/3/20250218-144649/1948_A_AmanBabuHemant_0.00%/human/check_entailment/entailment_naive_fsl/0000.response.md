Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a string with the specified number of special characters as per the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. The program uses the string '110' for constructing the output, which contains digits instead of uppercase Latin letters as required by the problem statement.
2. The program checks if `n` is even and only then generates a string, but it doesn't handle the case where `n` is odd correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is odd, the program should print 'NO'.
3. The string '110' * (n // 2) will not necessarily have exactly `n` special characters. For example, if `n` is 6, the string '110110' will have 4 special characters, not 6.

Let's consider a specific example:
- Input: `n = 1`
- Expected Output: `NO` (since it's not possible to have exactly 1 special character with the given rules)
- Actual Output: `NO` (which is correct in this case, but the program doesn't handle it correctly for other cases)

Another example:
- Input: `n = 6`
- Expected Output: `YES` followed by a string like `AAABAACC` which has exactly 6 special characters.
- Actual Output: `YES` followed by `110110` which has only 4 special characters.

To fix the program, we need to generate a string using uppercase Latin letters and ensure that it has exactly `n` special characters. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AB' * (n // 2)
            print('YES')
            print(s)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version uses the string 'AB' to ensure that the output string is made up of uppercase Latin letters and has exactly `n` special characters when `n` is even.
