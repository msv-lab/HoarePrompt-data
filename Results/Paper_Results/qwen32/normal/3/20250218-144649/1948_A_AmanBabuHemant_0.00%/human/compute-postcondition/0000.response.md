The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Given that `t` was initially described as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, after the execution of the code, the value of `t` will be the integer input provided, which still satisfies the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 50. The variable `n` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.**
