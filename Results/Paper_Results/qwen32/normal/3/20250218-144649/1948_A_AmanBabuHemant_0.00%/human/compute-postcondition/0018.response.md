The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes variables `t`, `n`, and `s`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 49. This value is not used in the `print` statement.
2. **Variable `n`**: It is an input integer. This value is also not used in the `print` statement.
3. **Variable `s`**: It is a string created by repeating the substring `'110'` a number of times equal to `n // 2`. Since `s` is not used in the `print` statement, its value does not affect the output.

Given the `print` statement `print('YES')`, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
