The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and determines if a specific string of length `n` can be constructed. If `n` is even and the resulting string length does not exceed 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
