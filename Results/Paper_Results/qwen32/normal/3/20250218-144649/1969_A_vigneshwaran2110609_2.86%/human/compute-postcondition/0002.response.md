Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`; `x` is an input integer.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to an input integer, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
