The given `print` statement is:

```python
print(2)
```

This statement directly prints the integer `2`, and does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `p`, `x`, `l`, `i`, `flag`). The value to be printed is explicitly specified as `2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **2**
