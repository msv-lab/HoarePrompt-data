Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`; `x` is a positive integer; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 2. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `flag` or the loop is not broken.**
