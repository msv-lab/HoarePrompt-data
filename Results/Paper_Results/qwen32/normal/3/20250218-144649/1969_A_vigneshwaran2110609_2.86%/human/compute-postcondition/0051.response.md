The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0, `n` is the old `x`, and `l` is a new list of integers from the input. Since the loop iterates from `0` to `x-1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The value of `x` remains the same as it defines the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented from 0 to 1.
- `x` remains the same.

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is greater than 0, `n` is the old `x`, `l` is a new list of integers from the input**
