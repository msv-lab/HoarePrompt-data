Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is greater than 0, `n` is the old `x`, `l` is a new list of integers from the input, `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `i`, `x`, `n`, `l`, and `flag` remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
