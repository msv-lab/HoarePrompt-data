The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print(2)`. This statement directly prints the integer value `2` to the console. The values of the variables `i`, `n`, `x`, `l`, and `flag` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement is not dependent on any of these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
2. The variable `n` is set to the old value of `x`.
3. The variable `x` is an input integer.
4. The list `l` contains integers, and there is a specific condition for the element at index `l[i] - 1` in `l` to be equal to `l[i] - 1`.
5. The variable `flag` is set to `True`.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print(2)` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
