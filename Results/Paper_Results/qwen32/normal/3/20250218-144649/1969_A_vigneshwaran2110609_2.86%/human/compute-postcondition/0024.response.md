The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The variables `i`, `n`, and `x` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **the loop completes all x iterations and prints 3, `i` is the old x, `n` is the old x, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
