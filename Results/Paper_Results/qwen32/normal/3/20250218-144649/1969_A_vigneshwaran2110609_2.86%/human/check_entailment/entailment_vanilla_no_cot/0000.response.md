Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. The logic for determining the minimum number of invitations is incorrect. The program checks if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, but this check is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of invitations needed.

2. If such a pair is found, the program prints `2` and breaks out of the loop, but it does not handle the case where no such pair exists. In that case, the program should print `3`, but it does so in an `else` clause of the `for` loop, which is not the correct approach.

3. The program does not correctly handle all cases where at least two friends need to be invited to ensure that at least two friends attend the party.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        invited = set()
        for i in range(n):
            if i + 1 not in invited and p[p[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                invited.add(i + 1)
                invited.add(p[i])
        if len(invited) >= 2:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(3)

func()
```

This corrected version maintains a set of invited friends and checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. If such pairs exist, it ensures that they are invited. If not, it defaults to inviting three friends.
