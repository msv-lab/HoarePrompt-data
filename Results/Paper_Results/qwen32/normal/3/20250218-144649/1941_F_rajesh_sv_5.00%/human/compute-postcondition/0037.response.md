The code snippet calculates the sum of the element at the `mid` index and `f`, and the sum of the element at the `mid + 1` index and `f`. These sums are then assigned to `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`, respectively.

Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is an element from `F`, `l` is the position where `left - f` would be inserted in `D`, `h` is the position where `right - f` would be inserted in `D` minus one, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

In simple terms, the Output State is: `D` remains a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` remain elements from `A`, `f` remains an element from `F`, `l` and `h` retain their positions, `mid` remains the calculated midpoint, `mid_sum` is the sum of the `mid`-indexed element of `D` and `f`, and `mid_next_sum` is the sum of the `(mid + 1)`-indexed element of `D` and `f`.
