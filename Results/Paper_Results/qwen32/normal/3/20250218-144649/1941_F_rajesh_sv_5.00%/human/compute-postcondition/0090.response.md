Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left - f` is less than an element in `D` and `right - f` is greater than an element in `D` such that there is at least one element between `left - f` and `right - f` in `D`; `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

In simpler terms, the list `D` remains a sorted list of unique values with the same conditions regarding `left - f` and `right - f`. The new variable `mid` is calculated based on the formula provided.
