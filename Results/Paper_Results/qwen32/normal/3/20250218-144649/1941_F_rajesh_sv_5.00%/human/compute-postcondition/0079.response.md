The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `h` is at least `l + 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `l` is `mid + 1`.

Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `h` is at least `l + 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is `mid + 1`.**
