Postcondition: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left - f` is less than an element in `D`, `right - f` is greater than an element in `D` such that there is at least one element between `left - f` and `right - f` in `D`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`. In both cases, `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`.**
