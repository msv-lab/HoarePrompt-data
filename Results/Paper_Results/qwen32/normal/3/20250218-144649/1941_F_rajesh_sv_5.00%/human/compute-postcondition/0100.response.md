Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left - f` is less than an element in `D`, `right - f` is greater than an element in `D` such that there is at least one element between `left - f` and `right - f` in `D`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is unchanged, `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

In simple terms: The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `l`. The calculations for `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` will be based on the new value of `l`.
