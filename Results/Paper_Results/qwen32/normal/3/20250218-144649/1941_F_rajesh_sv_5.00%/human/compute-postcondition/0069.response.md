Postcondition: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left` and `right` are elements from `A`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `l` and `h` are indices in `D` that define the range where `left - f` and `right - f` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, and `left - f` is less than `right - f`. `mid` is the index calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`.**
