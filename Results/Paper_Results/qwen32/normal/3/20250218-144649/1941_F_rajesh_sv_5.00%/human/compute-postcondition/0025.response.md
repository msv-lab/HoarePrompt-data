The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `index`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `index` becomes 4, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`A` is the tuple of values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is greater than 1, `m`, `k`, `D` is a sorted list of unique values from `func_4()`, `F` is the value returned by `func_4()`, `i` is 4, `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`, `max_diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`, `index` is 4.**
