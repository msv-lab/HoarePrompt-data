To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `ans` is defined as the minimum possible value of the maximum difference between `left - f` and `right - f` for all `f` in `F`. This implies `ans` is a computed value based on the differences between `left`, `right`, and each element `f` in the set `F`.
- `next_max_diff` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown based on the given information. However, it is assumed to be another computed value or a predefined variable in the broader context of the program.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(max(ans, next_max_diff))
```
This statement will print the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

### Output Description:
Since the exact values of `ans` and `next_max_diff` are not provided, we can't determine the specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum possible value of the maximum difference between `left - f` and `right - f` for all `f` in `F`, and next_max_diff is another value in the context of the program)**
