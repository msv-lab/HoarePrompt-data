In the provided task, the for loop will iterate based on the value of `testcases`, which is the value returned by the function `func_3()`. The loop will execute as long as `testcases` is greater than or equal to 1. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and `testcases`.

Given that `testcases` is guaranteed to be in the range 1 to 10^4, we do not need to adjust `testcases` to ensure the loop executes because it already meets the condition for execution. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop head and does not need to be adjusted since its value is not used within the loop body.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute. Here is the state:

State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()`, and it is guaranteed that 1 <= `testcases` <= 10^4**
