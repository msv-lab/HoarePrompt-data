The variable `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. This does not affect the values of `D`, `left`, `f`, `right`, or the condition that `left - f` is less than an element in `D` and `right - f` is greater than an element in `D` with at least one element between them. It also does not change the condition that `l < h`.

Output State: **`D` is a sorted list of unique values, `left - f` is less than an element in `D`, `right - f` is greater than an element in `D` such that there is at least one element between `left - f` and `right - f` in `D`, `l < h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.**
