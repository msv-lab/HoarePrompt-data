The code snippet `nums.append(-1)` adds the integer `-1` to the end of the list `nums`. This means that the length of `nums` increases by 1, and the new last element of `nums` is `-1`.

Given the initial state, `nums` is a list of `n` integers. After appending `-1`, `nums` will have `n + 1` integers, with the last integer being `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is an empty list.**
