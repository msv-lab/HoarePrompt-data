The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the values `-1` and `-1`. The initial state provides a detailed description of various variables and objects, but these details are not directly relevant to the `print` statement in question. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`.
2. This statement directly outputs the values `-1` and `-1`, separated by a space.
3. The values `-1` and `-1` are explicitly provided and do not depend on any other variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **-1, -1**
