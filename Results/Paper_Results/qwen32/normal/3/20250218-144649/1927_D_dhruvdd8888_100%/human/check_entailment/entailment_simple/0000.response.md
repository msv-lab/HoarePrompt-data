### Reasoning:

The given problem requires finding two different indices within a specified range in an array where the elements at those indices are not equal. The program provided processes this as follows:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`N`), the elements of the array (`nums`), the number of queries (`q`), and the queries themselves.

2. **Segmentation of the Array**:
   - The program segments the array into consecutive segments of identical numbers.
   - This is done by iterating through the array and noting the start and end indices of each segment along with the number in that segment.
   - The array is augmented with a `-1` at the end to ensure the last segment is captured.

3. **Processing Each Query**:
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or just after the left boundary of the query.
   - It then checks the segment to determine if there are two different indices within the query range (`l` to `r`) that have different values.
   - The logic for determining the indices involves checking the boundaries of the segment and the neighboring segments to find a pair that meets the criteria.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the indices of the pair of elements that are different, or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

### Analysis:

- The logic for segmenting the array and using binary search to find the relevant segment is correct.
- The conditions for checking the segments and determining the indices are well thought out.
- However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for determining the indices:
  - The program does not correctly handle cases where the segment found by `bisect_left` does not contain a pair of different indices within the query range.
  - Specifically, the logic does not correctly handle the case where the segment found is the last segment or where the segment found does not have a neighboring segment that can provide a different element within the query range.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
3
1 1 1
1
1 3
```

The program would segment the array into `[(1, 4, 1)]` (since the array is augmented with `-1` at the end). For the query `(1, 3)`, `bisect_left` would find the segment `(1, 4, 1)`. The program would then incorrectly output `-1 -1` because it does not correctly handle the case where the segment does not provide a pair of different indices.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly those where the segment found by `bisect_left` does not contain a pair of different indices within the query range. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
