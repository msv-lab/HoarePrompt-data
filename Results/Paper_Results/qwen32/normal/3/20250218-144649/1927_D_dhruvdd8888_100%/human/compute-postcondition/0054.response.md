The given print statement `print(-1, -1)` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the two integer values `-1` and `-1`.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about several variables and objects, such as `t`, `N`, `nums`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, and `eli`.
2. However, the `print` statement `print(-1, -1)` does not reference any of these variables or objects.
3. The `print` statement directly outputs the values `-1` and `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **-1, -1**
