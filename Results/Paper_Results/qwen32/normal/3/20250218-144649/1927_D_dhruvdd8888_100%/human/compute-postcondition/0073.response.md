Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`; `q` is 0 (since all queries have been processed); `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)` from the last iteration; `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)` from the last iteration; `num` is `nums[N]`; `arr` contains tuples `(start_index, end_index, number)` representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.**

In natural language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, all queries have been processed, so `q` is 0. The other variables remain in the state they were in after the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `s` and `e` are the start and end indices of the segment in `arr` that was last considered, and `num` remains the last element of `nums`. The list `arr` and its length `LA` also remain unchanged from the last iteration.
