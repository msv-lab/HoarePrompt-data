Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the length of a list `a` of `n` integers, and `q` representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r` representing a range in the list `a`. The function returns the sum of the integers in the list `a` for each query range `[l, r]`.**
