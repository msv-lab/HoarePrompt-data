The code snippet provided is `s = i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2. Therefore, the value of `s` is updated to 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `s` is 2; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[1]`; `arr` contains the tuple (1, 1, `nums[0]`) if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `arr` remains unchanged, and additionally contains the tuple `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])`; `i` is 2.**
