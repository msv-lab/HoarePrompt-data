The code snippet uses `bisect_left` to find the leftmost index in the list `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` could be inserted to maintain sorted order. The variable `eli` is assigned this index.

Given the initial state, `arr` contains tuples representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`. The tuple `(l, 0, 0)` is a placeholder where `l` is the start index of a segment, and the other two elements are placeholders for the end index and the number in the segment, respectively. The actual values of the second and third elements in the tuple do not affect the `bisect_left` operation as long as they are consistent with the sorting order of `arr`.

Since `l` is a specific integer read from input and the initial state specifies the structure of `arr`, the value of `eli` will be the index in `arr` where a segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `s` is the index of the last change in `nums` or `N` if the last element is different from the previous one; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[N]`; `arr` contains tuples `(start_index, end_index, number)` representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are integers read from input such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `eli` is the index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted.**
