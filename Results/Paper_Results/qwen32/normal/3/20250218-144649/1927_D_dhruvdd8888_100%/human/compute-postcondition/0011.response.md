Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is [(1, 0, `nums[0]`)], `i` is 0, and `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is the assignment `s = i`. Since `i` was initially 0, `s` is now also 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
