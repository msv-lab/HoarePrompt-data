Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The `input` function is reassigned to `sys.stdin.readline`.**

In simpler terms, `N` is now assigned the value read from the input, while all other variables and conditions remain as specified in the initial state.
