To determine what will be printed by the `print(s - 1, s)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the relevant variables involved.

### Key Variables and Their Descriptions:

1. **`nums`**: A list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`.
2. **`arr`**: A list of tuples `(start_index, end_index, number)` representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.
3. **`LA`**: The last index of `arr`, which is `len(arr) - 1`.
4. **`l` and `r`**: Integers read from input such that `1 <= l < r <= n + 1`.
5. **`eli`**: The index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted.
6. **`s`**: The start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
7. **`e`**: The end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`eli` Calculation**:
   - `eli` is the index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted. This is typically determined using a binary search or a similar method to find the correct position of `l` in the sorted segments of `arr`.

2. **`min(eli, LA)`**:
   - This ensures that we do not go out of bounds in `arr`. If `eli` is greater than `LA`, it will be capped at `LA`.

3. **`s` and `e`**:
   - `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.

4. **`print(s - 1, s)`**:
   - The statement prints `s - 1` and `s`.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **`s`**: This is the start index of the segment in `arr` that contains the index `l`. If `l` is exactly at the start of a segment, `s` will be `l`. If `l` is within a segment, `s` will be the start index of that segment.
- **`s - 1`**: This is simply `s` decremented by 1.

### Output:

The output will be the values of `s - 1` and `s`. Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `nums`, and `arr` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`)**
