Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `nums` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first `n` integers are the original `nums` and the last integer is `-1`; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`; `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`; `num` is `nums[N]`; `arr` contains tuples `(start_index, end_index, number)` representing segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are integers read from input such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n + 1`; `eli` is the index in `arr` where the segment starting at `l` would be found or inserted; `s` is less than or equal to `l`. If `e` >= `r`, the current value of `e` is such that `e >= r`. Otherwise, `e` is less than `r`. If `e` is less than `N` or `e` is less than `l`, then the condition `e < N or e < l` holds. Otherwise, `e` is less than or equal to `N` and `e` is greater than or equal to `l`.**
