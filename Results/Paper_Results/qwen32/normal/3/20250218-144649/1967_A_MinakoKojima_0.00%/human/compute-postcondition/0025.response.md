The code snippet `ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the difference between the 5th and 4th elements of the list `a` (since `i` is 5).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is an integer greater than 5.
- `k` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers updated according to the loop.
- `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`.
- `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the cumulative differences up to `a[4] - a[3]`.
- `i` is 5.

After executing the code:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[5] - a[4])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 5; `k` is 0; `a` is a list of integers updated according to the loop; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the cumulative differences up to `a[4] - a[3]` and then multiplied by `a[5] - a[4]`; `i` is 5.**
