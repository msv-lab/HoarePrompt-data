Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the new input split into two parts; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input. If `k >= n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, `a` is adjusted such that each `a[i]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `m` is the minimum value in the adjusted list `a`, `ans` is the product of the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, and `i` is set to `n-1`.**
