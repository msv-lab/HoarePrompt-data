Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split into two parts; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input (potentially updated in the else part); `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`. If `k >= n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers updated according to the loop, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the cumulative differences up to `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, and `i` is `n`.**
