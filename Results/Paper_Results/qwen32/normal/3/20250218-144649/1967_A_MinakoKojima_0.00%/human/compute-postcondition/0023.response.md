The code snippet multiplies the current value of `ans` by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, so the difference `a[4] - a[3]` is calculated and `ans` is updated accordingly. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is 0; `a` is a list of integers updated according to the loop; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the cumulative differences up to `a[4] - a[3]`; `i` is 4**.
