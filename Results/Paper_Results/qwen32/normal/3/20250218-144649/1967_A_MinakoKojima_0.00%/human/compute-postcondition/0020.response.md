The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range parameters `1` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n`.

Before the loop starts, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `m`, and `ans` are given states. However, only `i` and `n` can be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Since the loop starts with `i` initialized to 1, we don't need to adjust `i` before the loop starts. The crucial factor is `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `k` is 0; `a` is a list of integers updated according to the loop; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is the first element of the list `a`**
