The code snippet provided updates the list `a` by reading a new input and splitting it into integers. The initial state of `a` is not specified, but it is overwritten by the new input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the new input split into two parts; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`. If `k >= n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, and `i` is set to `n`.**
