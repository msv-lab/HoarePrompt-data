To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers updated based on the formula `a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
- `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `k` is less than `n * m`.

The loop statement is:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since the loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `x` (where `0 <= x < n`). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same (0).
- `a` remains the same (the list is updated within the loop, but we are considering the state before the next iteration starts).
- `m` remains the same (the minimum value in the list `a` is recalculated within the loop, but we are considering the state before the next iteration starts).
- `ans` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as `i` being incremented by 1. If we assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration can be written as:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`**

For clarity, if we assume `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3. So, a more concrete example would be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 3**

But the general form is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
