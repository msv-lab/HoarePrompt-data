The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was used in the loop, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `i` is 0 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
