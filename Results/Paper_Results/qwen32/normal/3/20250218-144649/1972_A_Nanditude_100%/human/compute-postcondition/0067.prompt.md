Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `cnt` is the total number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` as the loop progresses; `i` is the final index in `a` that has been considered.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is the total number of times `b[j] < a[i]` was true during the loop, and `i` is the total number of times `b[j] >= a[i]` was true during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is the specific input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is the total count of times `b[j]` is less than `a[i]` across all iterations, and `i` is the total number of times `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]` across all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
