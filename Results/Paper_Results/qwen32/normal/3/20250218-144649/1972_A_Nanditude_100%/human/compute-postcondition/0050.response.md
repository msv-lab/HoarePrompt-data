The code snippet sets the variable `i` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `cnt`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `n` is the specific input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a new list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is 0, and `i` is 0.**
