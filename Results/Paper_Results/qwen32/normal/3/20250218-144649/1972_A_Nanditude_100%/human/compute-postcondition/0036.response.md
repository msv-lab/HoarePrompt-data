The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Initial State: `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is 1 and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 1, `j` is `j + 1`

Since `cnt` is incremented by 1, if `cnt` was initially 1, it becomes 2. If `cnt` was initially 0, it becomes 1.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is `j + 1`**
