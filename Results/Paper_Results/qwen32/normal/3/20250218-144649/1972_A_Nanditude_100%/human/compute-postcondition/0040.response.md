Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the new input line, `j` is `j + 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged according to the given code snippet.
