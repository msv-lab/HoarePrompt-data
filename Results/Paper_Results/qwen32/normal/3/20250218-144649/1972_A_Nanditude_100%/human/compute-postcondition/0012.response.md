Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input line. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is 1 and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is increased to 1.**
