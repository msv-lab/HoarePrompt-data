### Reasoning:

To determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after cutting his original rectangle, we need to analyze the conditions under which he can achieve this.

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to one of the sides, he can either make a cut parallel to the side of length `a` or parallel to the side of length `b`.
   - If the cut is made parallel to the side of length `a`, the resulting rectangles will have dimensions `(a/2, b)` and `(a/2, b)`.
   - If the cut is made parallel to the side of length `b`, the resulting rectangles will have dimensions `(a, b/2)` and `(a, b/2)`.

2. **Forming Another Rectangle:**
   - For Bob to form another rectangle, the two resulting rectangles must be able to be rearranged into a new rectangle with different dimensions.
   - If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size `(a/2, b)`. These two rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle of size `(a, b/2)` if `b` is even, or `(a/2, 2b)` if `b` is odd. However, the key point is that if `a` is even, he can always form a new rectangle.
   - Similarly, if `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size `(a, b/2)`. These two rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle of size `(a/2, b)` if `a` is even, or `(2a, b/2)` if `a` is odd. Again, if `b` is even, he can always form a new rectangle.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the resulting rectangles will be of size `(a, 1)` and `(a, b-1)` or `(1, b)` and `(a-1, b)`, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Thus, the condition for Bob to be able to form another rectangle is that at least one of the dimensions (`a` or `b`) must be even.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly checks if either `a` or `b` is even and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No". This logic aligns with the reasoning above.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
