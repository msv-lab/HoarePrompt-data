Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet:

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- If either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, then either `a` or `b` is even.
- Otherwise, both `a` and `b` are odd integers.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print('No')
```

**Analysis:**
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The value of `t`, `a`, and `b` are provided in the initial state, but they do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` and will always output the string `'No'`.

**Output:**
Output: **No**
