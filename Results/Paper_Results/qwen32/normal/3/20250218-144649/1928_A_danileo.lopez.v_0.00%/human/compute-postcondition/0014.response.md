The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This means that the values of `a` and `b` will be updated based on the input provided, while the initial state of `t` remains unchanged.

Since the initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are integers read from the input and that either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, or both are odd, this condition will still hold after the input is read. The specific values of `a` and `b` will be whatever integers are provided in the input.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated values of `a` and `b` based on the input, while `t` retains its original value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, where either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, or both `a` and `b` are odd integers.**
