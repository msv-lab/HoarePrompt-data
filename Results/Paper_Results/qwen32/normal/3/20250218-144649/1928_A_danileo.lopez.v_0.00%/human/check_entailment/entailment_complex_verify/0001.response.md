### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to ensure its correctness. The core of the problem is determining whether Bob can form a new rectangle from two resulting rectangles after cutting his original rectangle in half.

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - Bob can cut the rectangle either parallel to the side of length `a` or parallel to the side of length `b`.
   - If the cut is made parallel to the side of length `a`, the resulting rectangles will have dimensions `(a/2, b)` if `a` is even, or `(a, 1)` and `(a, b-1)` if `a` is odd.
   - If the cut is made parallel to the side of length `b`, the resulting rectangles will have dimensions `(a, b/2)` if `b` is even, or `(1, b)` and `(a-1, b)` if `b` is odd.

2. **Forming Another Rectangle:**
   - If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size `(a/2, b)`. These two rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle of size `(a, b/2)` if `b` is even, or `(a/2, 2b)` if `b` is odd.
   - Similarly, if `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two rectangles of size `(a, b/2)`. These two rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle of size `(a/2, b)` if `a` is even, or `(2a, b/2)` if `a` is odd.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the resulting rectangles will be of size `(a, 1)` and `(a, b-1)` or `(1, b)` and `(a-1, b)`, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

From this analysis, it is clear that the condition for Bob to be able to form another rectangle is that at least one of the dimensions (`a` or `b`) must be even. This aligns with the logic implemented in the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly checks if either `a` or `b` is even and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No". This logic aligns with the reasoning above.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form another rectangle.

Final: **True**
