Let's analyze the problem description, the program code, and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b` and wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. From these two smaller rectangles, he wants to form a new rectangle that is different from the original (considering rotations as the same).

### Program Code Recap
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Annotations Recap
The annotations describe the program's behavior as follows:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`.
- It checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
  - If true, it prints "Yes".
  - Otherwise, it prints "No".
- The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when `a` and `b` are 1.

### Original Assessment Recap
The original assessment states that the program is correct because:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting an odd-sized side in half would result in non-integer dimensions.

### Evaluation
Let's validate the assessment using the annotations and the problem description.

1. **Even Case (`a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`)**:
   - If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles.
   - If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles.
   - These smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of different dimensions.
   - This part of the assessment is correct.

2. **Odd Case (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`)**:
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, cutting the rectangle would result in non-integer dimensions.
   - For example, cutting a `3 x 3` rectangle into two smaller rectangles would result in rectangles with dimensions `3 x 1.5`, which is not possible with integer sides.
   - Thus, Bob cannot form a new rectangle.
   - This part of the assessment is also correct.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `a` or `b` is 1, and the other dimension is odd, the program correctly identifies that no new rectangle can be formed.
   - When either dimension is even, the program correctly identifies that a new rectangle can be formed.

### Conclusion
The annotations and the problem description both support the original assessment. The program correctly determines if Bob can form another rectangle based on whether at least one of the dimensions is even.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
