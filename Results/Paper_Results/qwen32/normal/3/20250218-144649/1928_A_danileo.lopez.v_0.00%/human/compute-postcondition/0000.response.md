The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After executing this line, `t` will hold the value of the integer input provided by the user, and this value will still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.**
