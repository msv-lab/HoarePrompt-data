Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input for each of the `t` test cases. For each test case, if either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, the program prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, if both `a` and `b` are odd, the program prints 'No'. After all `t` iterations, the loop terminates and no further input is processed.**

In simpler terms, the loop will run `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read two integers `a` and `b`. It will print 'Yes' if either `a` or `b` is even, and 'No' if both are odd. Once all `t` test cases have been processed, the loop ends.
