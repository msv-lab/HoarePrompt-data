The value of `nx` is incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Given that `i` is `n + 1` and `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0. Therefore, `nx` is incremented by `xx[n + 1][0]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as `n` is still greater than 0 and `i` is still `n + 1`. The value of `j` also remains 1. 

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `nx` is increased by `xx[n + 1][0]`**.
