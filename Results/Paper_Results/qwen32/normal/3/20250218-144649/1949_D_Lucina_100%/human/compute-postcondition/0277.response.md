The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was 3, and `n` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be incremented by 1, but since `j` is already equal to `n`, the loop will not execute again.

However, if we are to adjust the state to reflect the start of the next iteration (assuming we are simulating the state just before the next iteration would start, even though it won't), we would increment `j` by 1.

State: **`n` is 3, `j` is 4**
