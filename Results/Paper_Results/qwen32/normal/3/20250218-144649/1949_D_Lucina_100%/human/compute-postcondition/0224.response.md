Postcondition: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is either 'F', 'S', or 'F'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is 'S' if `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.**
