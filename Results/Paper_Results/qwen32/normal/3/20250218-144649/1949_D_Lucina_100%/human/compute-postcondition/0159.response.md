Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is in the list `sa` before the index `n // 4 - 1`, `nx` has been updated to include 'F' at the end. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to include an additional 'S' at the end.**
