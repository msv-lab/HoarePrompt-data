Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type should be shown. The logic for filling in the '?' characters does not ensure this constraint is met for all possible permutations of the scenarios.

Here is a specific counterexample:

**Input:**
```
4
.F??
.?F?
?F.S
??S.
```

**Expected Output:**
The output should ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 4}{4} \rceil = 3\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown for any permutation of the scenarios.

One possible correct output could be:
```
.FFS
F.FS
FS.S
SFS.
```

However, the provided program might generate an output like:
```
.FFS
F.FS
FSFF
SFFF
```

In this output, the sequence "FFF" appears, which violates the constraint of no more than 3 consecutive videos of the same type.

### Why the Program is Incorrect:

The program's logic for filling in the '?' characters does not take into account the constraint of consecutive videos of the same type. It simply fills in 'F' or 'S' based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the array, which does not guarantee that the constraint will be met for all permutations of the scenarios.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it constructs the transition videos in a way that respects the constraint for all possible permutations, which is a more complex task than simply counting and filling in characters.
