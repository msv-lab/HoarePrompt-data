The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Given the initial state where `nx` is an empty string `''`, after executing the code, `nx` becomes `'S'`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 1, `nx` is 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'**.
