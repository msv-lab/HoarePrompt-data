The code provided reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the size of a square matrix where each element is one of 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The values of the matrix are not altered or read by this code snippet, and the precondition about the matrix remains valid.

The only change is that the variable `n` is assigned the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input value, and the matrix described in the initial state remains unchanged.**
