The code `nx += 'S'` appends the string 'S' to the variable `nx`. However, the initial state does not mention the variable `nx`. Given the provided initial state, we can only assume that `nx` is a string variable before this operation. After the operation, the value of `nx` is updated to include 'S' at the end, while the values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `j` is 3, `nx` is a string ending with 'S'**.
