The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The initial state of `sa` does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted. 

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 1 in the first iteration of the loop, so we do not need to set it before the loop starts.

State: **`sa` is the initial state, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
