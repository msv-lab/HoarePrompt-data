The code snippet provided is `nx += xx[i][j - 1]`. Given the initial state, the values of `i` and `j` are 2 and 3, respectively. Therefore, `xx[i][j - 1]` translates to `xx[2][2]`, which is `'SSF'[2]`, or `'F'`.

The variable `nx` is not defined in the initial state, so we can assume it is being initialized to an empty string (as it is being concatenated to). After the operation, `nx` will be `'F'`.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `i`, `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `nx` is 'F'**.
