The value at index `j` in list `a` is increased by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the value at index 2 in list `a` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and the value at index `i` in list `a` is increased by 1, the value at index 2 in list `a` is increased by 1.**
