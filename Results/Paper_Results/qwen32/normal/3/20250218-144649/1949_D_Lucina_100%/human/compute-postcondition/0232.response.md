The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at index `j - 1` of the string located at index `i` in the list `xx` to the variable `nx`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 3. Therefore, `xx[i]` is `xx[1]` which is the string `'FSF'`. The character at index `j - 1` (which is 2) in the string `'FSF'` is `'F'`. Thus, `nx` will get `'F'` appended to it.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF'], `sa` is [], `sb` is [], `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `nx` is 'F'**.
