Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the integer input value, `a` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = input()
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if x[j - 1] == 'F':
            a[i] += 1
            a[j] += 1
        elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
            b[i] += 1
            b[j] += 1
    xx.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 1; `a` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `a[i]` which is incremented by the number of 'F' characters in `x` and `a[j]` which is incremented by 1 for each 'F' character at position `j - 1` in `x`; `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `b[i]` which is incremented by the number of 'S' characters in `x` and `b[j]` which is incremented by 1 for each 'S' character at position `j - 1` in `x`; `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the user's input string `x`; `x` is the user's input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a[i]` is incremented by the number of 'F' characters in `x`, `b[i]` is incremented by the number of 'S' characters in `x`, and for each `j` from 1 to `n`, `a[j]` is incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'F', and `b[j]` is incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S'. The values of `n`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged. `xx` now includes `x` as its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: x is "FSF", n is 3, xx is ['FSF'], i is 0, a is [2, 1, 0, 1], b is [1, 0, 1, 0].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
