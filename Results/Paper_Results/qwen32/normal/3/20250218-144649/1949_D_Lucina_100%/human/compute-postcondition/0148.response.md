The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of the string constructed so far, which is `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be `n + 1`. Since `n` is the length of the string constructed so far, it does not need to change for the loop to execute one more time. However, for the loop to execute, `n + 1` should be greater than the current `i`, which means `n + 1` should be the new `i`.

State: **a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters according to the conditions specified in the loop, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the same**
