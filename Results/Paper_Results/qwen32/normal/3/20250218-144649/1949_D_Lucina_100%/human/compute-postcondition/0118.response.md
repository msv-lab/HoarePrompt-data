The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4. However, since `i` (which is now 4) is not less than or equal to `n` (which is 3), the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the start of the loop if it were to continue) would be:
State: **`n` is 3, `i` is 4**
