The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the list `a` by 1. Given that `a` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, the value at index `i` will change from 0 to 1 after the execution of the code. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `a[i]` which is 1, `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `x` is the user's input string, and the character at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'F'.**
