To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **String Construction**: The string is of length `n`, and each character is determined based on the following conditions:
   - If the character is not '?', it remains `xx[i][j - 1]`.
   - If `i` or `j` (or both) are in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, the character is 'F'.
   - Otherwise, the character is 'S'.
   
2. **Variables**:
   - `n`: The length of the string.
   - `xx`: A 2D list (matrix) from which characters are potentially taken if the character is not '?'.
   - `sa`: A list that defines certain indices to check against `i` and `j`.
   - `nx`: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, which means it could be a typo or a variable that is supposed to be defined elsewhere in the code that is not provided here. Since it is not defined, we cannot determine its value based on the given information.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is `print(nx)`. However, `nx` is not defined in the given initial state, making it impossible to determine its value based on the provided information.

### Conclusion:
Since `nx` is not defined, we cannot provide a precise value for what will be printed. The output of the print statement will depend on the value of `nx`, which is not given.

Output: **nx (where nx is a variable that is not defined in the given initial state)**
