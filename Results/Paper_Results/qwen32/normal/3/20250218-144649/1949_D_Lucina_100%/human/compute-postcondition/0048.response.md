The code snippet `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, this means `b[2]` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `b[i]` is incremented by 1, but it does not specify the value of `i`, so we don't know if `i` is equal to `j` (which is 2). However, the code only affects `b[2]`, so we can confidently say that `b[2]` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `b[i]` is incremented by 1, `b[2]` is incremented by 1.**
