Postcondition: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `a[i]` which is either 2 or 1, and `a[j]` which is either 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the character at index `j` in `x`. `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` except `b[j + 1]` which is 2 if `j + 1` is the same as `i` or 1 if `j + 1` is different from `i` if the character at position `j` in `x` is 'S', or `b[j + 1]` which is 3 if `j + 1` is the same as `i` or 2 if `j + 1` is different from `i` if the character at position `j` in `x` is 'S' and the if condition is false. If the character at position `j` in `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', `b[j + 1]` is 1 if `j + 1` is the same as `i` or `b[j + 1]` remains 0 if `j + 1` is different from `i`. If `x[j - 1] == 'S'`, `b[i]` is incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1] == 'F'`, `a[j]` may be 3 or 4. If `x[j - 1] == 'F'` and the if condition is true, `a[j]` is 4. `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `x` is the user's input string, and `j` is `j + 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes the changes made to the lists `a` and `b` based on the character at index `j` in `x` and the truth value of the if condition. It also accounts for the increments to `b[i]` and `b[j]` when `x[j - 1]` is 'S'.
