Postcondition: **`sa` is the initial state, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `nx` is set based on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` (or both) is in the list `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**
