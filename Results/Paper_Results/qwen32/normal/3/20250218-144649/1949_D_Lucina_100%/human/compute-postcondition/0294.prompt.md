You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line is one of 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', where 'F' indicates a funny transition video, 'S' indicates a scary transition video, '?' indicates an undecided transition video, and '.' indicates that i=j. The i-th character of the j-th line is the same as the j-th character of the i-th line for all i and j. There are at most floor(n/2) characters in the input that are 'F' or 'S'.

    #State: `n` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 4, 4], `b` is [1, 2, 3, 3], `xx` is ['', 'FSF', 'SSF', 'SFF']. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, `sa` contains a list of `n` strings, where each string is of length `n` and constructed by appending characters from `xx[i]` according to the conditions: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', append it; if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', append 'F' if `i` or `j` (or both) are in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, append 'S'. Otherwise, `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged as empty lists.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 24) and a grid of n lines, each containing n characters. Each character in the grid is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', representing different types of transition videos or no transition. The function returns a result based on the configuration of these characters, ensuring there are at most floor(n/2) 'F' or 'S' characters.
