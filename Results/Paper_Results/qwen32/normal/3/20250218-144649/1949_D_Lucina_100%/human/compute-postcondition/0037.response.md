The code snippet `a[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` of the list `a` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, so the value at index 1 of the list `a` is increased by 1. The values of `n` and the element at index 0 of the list `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, the element at index 0 of the list `x` is 'F', and the value at index 1 of the list `a` is increased by 1.**
