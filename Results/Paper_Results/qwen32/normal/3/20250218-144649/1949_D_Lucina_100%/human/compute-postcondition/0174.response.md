The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and its relation to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n + 1` if we are considering the loop to terminate. However, for the loop to continue executing, `i` should be incremented to the next value it would take in the sequence, which is `n + 1` minus the increment (since the increment happens at the end of the iteration in the loop structure).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n`.

State: **`nx` is a string constructed by appending characters from `xx[n + 1]` according to the given conditions. If `xx[n + 1][j - 1]` is not '?', the character is appended to `nx`. If `xx[n + 1][j - 1]` is '?', 'F' is appended if `n + 1` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, 'S' is appended, `i` is `n`**
