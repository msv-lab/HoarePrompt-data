The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` adds the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Given the initial state, `j` is 4, so `j - 1` is 3. Therefore, the value `xx[i][3]` will be added to `nx`. The value of `nx` before this operation is unknown, and the value of `xx[i][3]` is also unknown, but we can express the new value of `nx` as its previous value plus `xx[i][3]`.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `j` is 4, `nx` is its previous value plus `xx[i][3]`**.
