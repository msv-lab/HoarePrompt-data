The code snippet `b[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` of the list `b` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, the value at `b[3]` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `b[i]` is incremented by 1, but since `i` is not specified to be the same as `j`, we can assume this is a separate operation or a different part of the code not affecting this specific statement. Therefore, the only change here is the increment of `b[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `b[i]` is incremented by 1, `b[3]` is incremented by 1.**
