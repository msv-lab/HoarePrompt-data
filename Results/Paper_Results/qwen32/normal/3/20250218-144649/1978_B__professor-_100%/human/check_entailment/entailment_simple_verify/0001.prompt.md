You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and ensure it correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
    - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Maximum Profit:**
    - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
        - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because selling them at `b` would yield less profit.
        - The formula `n * a` correctly computes the total profit in this case.
    - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
        - If the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`, it's optimal to sell all buns using the modified price scheme.
        - The modified price for the first bun is `b`, the second is `b-1`, and so on, until the `n`-th bun, which is sold for `b - (n-1)`.
        - The sum of an arithmetic series can be used to compute the total profit: `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.
    - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
        - If the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, it's optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
        - The sum of the modified prices for the first `b - a` buns is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`.
        - The remaining `n - (b - a)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `a * (n - (b - a))` to the total profit.
        - The formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n` correctly computes the total profit in this case.

3. **Edge Cases:**
    - The program handles the edge cases where `b <= a` and `b - a >= n` correctly.
    - The program also handles the case where `b - a < n` correctly by splitting the buns into two groups and computing the profit for each group.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly computes the maximum profit for all possible scenarios described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
