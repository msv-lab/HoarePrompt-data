Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer; `n`, `a`, and `b` are each an integer from 1 to 10^9 and represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price for each of the `t` test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if b <= a:
        print(n * a)
    elif b - a >= n:
        print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
    else:
        print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are each an integer from 1 to 10^9 as read from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `b - a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `a`, and `b` are each an integer from 1 to 10^9 as read from the input. `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. If `b <= a`, no change is made to `n`, `a`, `b`, or `t`. Otherwise, if `b - a >= n`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, the condition is not satisfied. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged in all cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `a`, and `b` are each an integer from 1 to 10^9 as read from the input; `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. If `b <= a`, no change is made to `n`, `a`, `b`, or `t`. Otherwise, if `b - a >= n`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, the condition is not satisfied. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged in all cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
