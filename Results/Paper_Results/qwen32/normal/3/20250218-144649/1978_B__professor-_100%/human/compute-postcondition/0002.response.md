The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are each an integer from 1 to 10^9. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are each an integer from 1 to 10^9 as read from the input.**
