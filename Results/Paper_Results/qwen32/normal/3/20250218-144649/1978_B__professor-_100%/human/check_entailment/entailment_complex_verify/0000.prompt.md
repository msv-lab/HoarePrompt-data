You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. There are t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) such test cases.

    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases and printed the corresponding costs for each test case. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` do not retain any specific values after the loop ends.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (modified price of the first bun). For each test case, it calculates and prints the total cost of purchasing all `n` buns, considering the first bun's price as `b` and the remaining buns' price as `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob sells `n` buns. The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price, where the `i`-th bun (for `1 ≤ i ≤ k`) is sold for `(b - i + 1)` coins. The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each. Bob needs to determine the maximum profit he can obtain by choosing an optimal `k`.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - **Explanation**: If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is always better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because selling them at the modified price would yield less or equal profit.
   - **Implementation**: `print(n * a)` is correct for this case.

2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
   - **Explanation**: If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price. The profit would be the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
   - **Implementation**: `print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))` is correct for this case. This formula calculates the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`.

3. **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
   - **Explanation**: If the difference is less than `n`, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
   - **Implementation**: `print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))` is incorrect for this case. The formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time. However, the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns should be sold at the usual price `a`, which means the correct formula should be `((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2) + a * (n - (b - a))`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `b - a < n` properly. Specifically, the formula for the profit in this case is incorrect.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5 5 6
```
- According to the problem, the optimal `k` would be 1 (since `b - a = 1` which is less than `n = 5`).
- The profit would be `6 + 5*4 = 26`.
- The provided program calculates the profit as `1*2//2 + 5*5 = 26`, which is correct for this specific case, but the general formula is incorrect.

However, let's consider another case:
```
1
5 5 7
```
- The optimal `k` would be 2 (since `b - a = 2` which is less than `n = 5`).
- The profit would be `(7 + 6) + 5*3 = 31`.
- The provided program calculates the profit as `2*3//2 + 5*5 = 28`, which is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where `b - a < n` correctly.
