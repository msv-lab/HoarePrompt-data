The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (modified price of the first bun). For each test case, it calculates and prints the total cost of purchasing all `n` buns, considering the first bun's price as `b` and the remaining buns' price as `a`.
