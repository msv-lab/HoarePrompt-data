Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all scenarios to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum profit when `b > a` and `b - a < n` is incorrect. 

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Case when `b <= a`:** The program correctly calculates the profit by selling all buns at the usual price `a`.

2. **Case when `b - a >= n`:** The program correctly calculates the profit by selling all buns at the modified prices, which form an arithmetic sequence from `b` down to `b - n + 1`.

3. **Case when `b > a` and `b - a < n`:** The program incorrectly calculates the profit. It seems to assume that the optimal strategy is to sell `(b - a + 1)` buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price `a`. However, this is not necessarily true. The optimal `k` (number of buns sold at modified prices) can be any value from `0` to `n`, and it needs to be determined by comparing the profits for different values of `k`.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate over possible values of `k` from `0` to `n` and calculate the profit for each `k`. The profit for a given `k` is calculated as the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence `(b, b-1, ..., b-k+1)` plus the profit from selling the remaining `(n-k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
            # Calculate profit for selling k buns at modified prices
            if k > 0:
                profit = (k * (2 * b - k + 1)) // 2
            else:
                profit = 0
            # Add profit from selling the remaining (n - k) buns at the usual price
            profit += a * (n - k)
            # Update max_profit if the current profit is higher
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)

# Call the function to execute the program
func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum profit by considering all possible values of `k` and choosing the one that yields the highest profit.
