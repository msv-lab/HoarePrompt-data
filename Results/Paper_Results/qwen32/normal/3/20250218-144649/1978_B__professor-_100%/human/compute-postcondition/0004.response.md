The `print(n * a)` statement will output the product of the variables `n` and `a`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are each integers ranging from 1 to 10^9.
- The current value of `b` is less than or equal to `a`.

However, the value of `t` and the condition involving `b` are not directly relevant to the calculation of `n * a`. The print statement only involves the multiplication of `n` and `a`.

Since `n` and `a` are both integers within the range of 1 to 10^9, the result of `n * a` will be an integer.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are integers from 1 to 10^9)**
