To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`string`**: This is the input string.
2. **`n`**: This is the length of the string `string` and is at least 1.
3. **`j`**: This variable is initialized to 1.
4. **`s`**: This is a list of characters from `string`.
5. **`x`**: This is the first character of `s`, i.e., `s[0]`.
6. **`count2`**: This variable is mentioned but not used or modified in the provided code snippet, so its value is irrelevant for the output.
7. **`count`**: This variable is mentioned but not initialized in the provided code snippet. However, based on the condition, it seems to be used to track some index, but its exact value before the condition is not known.
8. **`done`**: This variable is mentioned but not initialized in the provided code snippet. It seems to be a flag used to break out of a loop or conditional statement based on whether certain characters in the string match or not.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The provided code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` without any dependency on the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. The initial state provides context about the variables and their relationships but does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
