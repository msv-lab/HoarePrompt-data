Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement executes.

Let's break down the initial state and the given information:

1. `string` is the input string.
2. `n` is at least 1.
3. `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
4. `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`.
5. `i` is incremented by 1.
6. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
7. `x` is `s[0]`.
8. `count` is greater than 0.
9. The state of `count` and `done` remains as per the previous conditions.
10. `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
11. `count` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2` and `done` is set to `True`.

The only relevant part of the provided code snippet for determining the output is the `print('YES')` statement. This statement is independent of the values of the variables `string`, `n`, `j`, `count2`, `i`, `s`, `x`, `count`, and `done` as it directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print('YES')` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
