Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`. If `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
