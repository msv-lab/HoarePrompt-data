Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the newly input string; `j` is 0; `count` is greater than 1; `count2` is equal to `count`; `done` is True; `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
