The value of `count2` is reset to 0. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count2` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, `count` is 1 and `done` is not set to `True`, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.**
