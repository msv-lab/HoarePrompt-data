In the given initial state, the code snippet contains only a single `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement is printing a string literal 'YES'. The value 'YES' is explicitly provided and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
