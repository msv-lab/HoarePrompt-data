Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the newly input string; `j` is 0; `count` is greater than 0; `count2` is either less than or equal to `count` or greater than `count`; `done` is True if `count2` is greater than `count`, otherwise `done` remains the same as per the precondition; `s[j]` is not equal to `x`; and `count2` is not equal to `count`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
