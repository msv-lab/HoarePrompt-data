Output State: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count2` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, `count` is 1, `done` is not set to `True`, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the loop's code and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values.
