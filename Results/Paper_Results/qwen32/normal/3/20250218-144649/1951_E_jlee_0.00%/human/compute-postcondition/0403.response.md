To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions described in the problem.

### Initial State:
- `string` is the input string.
- `n` is the length of the string (at least 1).
- `j` is initialized to 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `x` is the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`).
- `count2` remains unchanged (its value is not specified but it is not used in the print statement).
- `count` is a variable that will be set to `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.
- `done` is a boolean variable that will be set to `True` and the loop will break if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`; otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.

### Conditions:
1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`.
2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True` and the loop breaks.
3. Otherwise, `count` and `done` remain unchanged.

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is outside of any loop or conditional block that could prevent it from executing. Therefore, regardless of the values of `s[j]`, `x`, `count`, and `done`, the statement `print('YES')` will always execute.

### Output:
Since the `print('YES')` statement is not conditional on any variable or state that could prevent it from being executed, it will always print "YES".

Output: **YES**
