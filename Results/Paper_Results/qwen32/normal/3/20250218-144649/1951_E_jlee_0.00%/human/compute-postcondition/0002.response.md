The code snippet provided takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `string`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the input operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `string` and the unchanged value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the input string.**
