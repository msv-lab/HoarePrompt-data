Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the input string with at least 1 character; `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`; `count2` is equal to `count`; `j` is 0. The value of `count` is greater than 1, indicating that `s[j]` is not equal to `x` for some `j` less than `count`, and `count` has been set to that `j`. Additionally, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.**
