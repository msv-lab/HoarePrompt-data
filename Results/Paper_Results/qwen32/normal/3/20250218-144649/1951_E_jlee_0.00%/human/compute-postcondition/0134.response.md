Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `string` is the input string with at least 1 character.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `j` is set to 2.
- There is a conditional statement that checks if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If this condition is true, `count` is set to 2. However, the variables `count`, `count2`, and `done` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we can assume they are not relevant to the `print` statement.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. The condition mentioned in the initial state does not affect what is printed by this statement. The variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, and `done` are not used in the `print` statement.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
