Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is the length of `string`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count` is the index of the first character not equal to `x` if such a character exists before the midpoint of the string, `count2` counts the number of characters equal to `x` after `count` up to the midpoint of the string, `done` is `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `s` is a list of characters from `string`. `x` is `s[0]`. If `n` is equal to 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`, the state of the variables remains unchanged as per the if part description.**
