The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`string`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, `done`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
