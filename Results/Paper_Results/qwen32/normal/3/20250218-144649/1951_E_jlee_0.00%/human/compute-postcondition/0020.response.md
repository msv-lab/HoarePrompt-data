Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`; if `n` equals 1, `done` remains False. Otherwise, the state of `done` is unchanged; `x` is the first character of `string`. Not all characters in `s` are equal to `x`.**
