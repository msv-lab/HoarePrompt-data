Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. `string` is the input string with at least 1 character.
3. `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character.
4. `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1.
5. `x` is the first character of `string`.
6. `j` is initially set to 2.
7. The conditional statement checks if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If true, `count` is set to 2. Otherwise, `count`, `count2`, and `done` remain unchanged.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, or `done`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not rely on any conditional logic or variable values, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
