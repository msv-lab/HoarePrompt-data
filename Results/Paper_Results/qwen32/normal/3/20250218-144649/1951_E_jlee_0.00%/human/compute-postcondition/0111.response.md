Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `string` is the input string with at least 1 character, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `j` is 1. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `count`, `count2`, and `done` remain unchanged. If `count` is not greater than 0, the values of `count`, `count2`, and `done` remain unchanged.**
