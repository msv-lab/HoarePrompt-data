Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the input string with at least 1 character; `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`; `count2` is 0; `j` is 0; `count` is 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
