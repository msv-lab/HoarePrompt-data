Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `string` is the input string with at least 1 character, `s` is a list of characters from `string` with at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `j` is 2, `count` is unchanged, `count2` is 0, `done` is unchanged.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply proceeds to the next iteration of the loop (if within a loop). Since no changes are made to any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
