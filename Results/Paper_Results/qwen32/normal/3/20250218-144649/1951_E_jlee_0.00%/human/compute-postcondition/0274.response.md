Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the newly input string; `j` is 2. If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, then `count` is set to 2. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. If `count > 1`, `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` equals `x` and `count` is greater than 0. If `count <= 1`, `count2` is set to 0. `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, the innermost loop or if statement is exited.**
