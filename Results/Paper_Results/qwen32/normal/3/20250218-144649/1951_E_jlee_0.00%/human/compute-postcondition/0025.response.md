Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An integer where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. This variable represents the number of test cases or some kind of limit, but it is not used in the provided code snippet.
2. **`string`**: The input string.
3. **`s`**: A list of characters from `string`.
4. **`n`**: The length of the list `s`. It is given that `n > 1`.
5. **`x`**: The first character of `string`.
6. **`s.count(x) == n - 1`**: This means that the first character `x` appears `n - 1` times in the string `string`.
7. **Not all characters in `s` are equal to `x`**: This implies there is at least one character in `string` that is different from `x`.
8. **`done`**: This variable is mentioned but does not affect the print statement, so we can ignore it.
9. **Either `n` is even, or `n` is odd and the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` of `s` is equal to `x`**: This condition ensures that if `n` is odd, the middle character is `x`.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state. The conditions provided in the initial state do not influence the content of the print statement. The print statement is a simple string output.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
