Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`; `s.count(x) == n`, meaning all characters in `s` are the same as the first character `x`. If `n` equals 1, `done` remains False. Otherwise, the state of `done` is unchanged; `x` is the first character of `string` and `x` is equal to every other character in `s`.**
