Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `string` is the input string.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `j` is 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `x` is `s[0]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (Note: `i` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task).
- There is a condition related to `count` and `done` which is not relevant to the current `print` statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains only a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The value to be printed is explicitly given in the code and does not depend on any variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is straightforward and prints the integer `1`, the output will be:

Output: **1**
