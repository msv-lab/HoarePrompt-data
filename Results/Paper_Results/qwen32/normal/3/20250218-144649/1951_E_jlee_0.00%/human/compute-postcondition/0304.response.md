To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **string**: This is the input string.
2. **n**: The length of the input string `string`.
3. **j**: This is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the midpoint of the string.
4. **count**: This variable is the index of the first character in the string that is not equal to `x` (the first character of the string) before the midpoint `j`. If no such character exists, `count` remains undefined.
5. **count2**: This counts the number of characters equal to `x` after `count` up to the midpoint `j`.
6. **done**: This is a boolean variable initialized to `False`.
7. **i**: This variable is incremented by 1, but its initial value is not specified. This variable is not used in the given print statement.
8. **s**: This is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
9. **x**: This is the first character of the string `s[0]`.
10. **Special Conditions**:
    - If `n` is equal to 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
    - If `x` is not equal to the last character of the string, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
The `print('NO')` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state. The conditions mentioned in the initial state do not affect the execution of the `print` statement because it does not depend on any of the variables or their values.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement is `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
