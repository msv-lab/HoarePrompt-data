Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`, `count` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `done` is `True`, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of `count2` remains as per the previous conditions, and `count2` is either 0 or not less than `count`, and `count2` is not equal to `count`.**
