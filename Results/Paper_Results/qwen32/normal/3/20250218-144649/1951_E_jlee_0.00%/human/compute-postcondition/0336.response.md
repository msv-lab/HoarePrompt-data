Postcondition: **`string` is the input string, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `count2` is equal to `count`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `x` is `s[0]`. `count` is greater than 0. The state of `count` and `done` remains as per the previous conditions. `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. `count` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2` and `done` is set to `True`.**

In simpler terms, the postcondition states that `string` and `n` retain their initial values, `j` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, and `count2` is equal to `count`. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, and `x` is the first character of `s`. The value of `count` is greater than 0 and has been updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `done` is set to `True`. Additionally, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
