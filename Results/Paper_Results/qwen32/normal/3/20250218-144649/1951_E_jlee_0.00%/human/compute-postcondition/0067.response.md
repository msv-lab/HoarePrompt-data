Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, we can analyze the situation as follows:

1. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
2. `string` is a non-empty input string.
3. `s` is a list of characters derived from `string`.
4. `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 1.
5. `x` is the first character of `string`.
6. `count2` is greater than `count`.
7. `j` is 0.
8. `count` is greater than 0, indicating that there is some index `j` (less than `count`) where `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
9. `s[j]` is not equal to `x` for the specific `j` that was found.

The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count2`, `j`, or `count`. The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
