Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `x // i`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` is now the maximum between its previous value and the result of `x // i`. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, and the incremented `i`) remain unchanged.
