Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8; `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Given the if condition `if n <= i:`, if `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `x // i`. If `n` is greater than `i`, `ans` remains unchanged.
