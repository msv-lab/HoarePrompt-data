Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `ans` is updated to be the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `x // i` if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, `t`, `x`, and `n` retain their previous values. `i` is now the next integer value from its previous state. `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`; otherwise, `ans` stays the same.
