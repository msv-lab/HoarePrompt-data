Let's analyze the given for loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

The for loop is:
```
for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable here is `i`, and it ranges from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1`. The `isqrt(x)` function returns the integer square root of `x`, which is the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= x`.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `x` and `n` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8
- `ans` is calculated based on the condition: if `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of `i` and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has a specific value. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, as the loop iterates over consecutive integers starting from 1 up to `isqrt(x) + 1`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `t`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
- `ans` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is the maximum of `i` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to `i`, otherwise `ans` remains 0**.

However, since we only adjust the states of objects in the loop head (`i` in this case), the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ x ≤ 10^8; `i` is incremented by 1**.
