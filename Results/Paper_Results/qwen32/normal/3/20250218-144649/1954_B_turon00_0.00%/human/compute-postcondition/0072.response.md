Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ `t` - 1 â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is the newly input integer `n`, and `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the variable `cnt` has been incremented by 1, making its value 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
