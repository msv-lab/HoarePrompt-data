Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`.
- `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, and the length of `aa` is 1. This means all elements in `a` are the same.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward. It prints the integer `-1` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, or `aa`. The value `-1` is explicitly given in the print statement and does not depend on any of the other variables.

### Output:
Output: **-1**
