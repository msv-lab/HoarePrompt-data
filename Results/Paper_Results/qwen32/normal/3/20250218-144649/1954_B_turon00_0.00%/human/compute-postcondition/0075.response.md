The code snippet provided resets the variable `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and the `i`-th element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**

In natural language: The variable `cnt` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
