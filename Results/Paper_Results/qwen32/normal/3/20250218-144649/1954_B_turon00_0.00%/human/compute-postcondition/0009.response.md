The code snippet provided initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`) are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the newly introduced variable `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`. If the length of `aa` is 1, it means all elements in `a` are the same; `cnt` is 0.**
