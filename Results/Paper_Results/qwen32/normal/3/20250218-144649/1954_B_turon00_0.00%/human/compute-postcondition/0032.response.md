The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` based on the integer input provided. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `cnt`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`; `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of elements equal to `tmp`; `ans` is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` encountered during the loop, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
