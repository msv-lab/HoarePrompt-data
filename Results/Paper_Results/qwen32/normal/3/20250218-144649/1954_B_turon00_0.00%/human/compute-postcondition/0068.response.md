The provided Python code snippet resets the variable `cnt` to 0. This action does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the other variables retain their previous values and states.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the newly input integer; `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`; `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`. If the length of `aa` is 1, the conditions described above hold without any additional changes.**
