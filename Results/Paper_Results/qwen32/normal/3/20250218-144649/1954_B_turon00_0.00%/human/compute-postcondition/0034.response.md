The code snippet assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. The values of `a`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer; `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.**
