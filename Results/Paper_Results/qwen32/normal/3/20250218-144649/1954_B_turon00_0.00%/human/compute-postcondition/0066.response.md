The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print(-1)
```

This statement is independent of the variables `a`, `t`, `n`, `tmp`, `aa`, `cnt`, and `ans` as described in the initial state. The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **-1**
