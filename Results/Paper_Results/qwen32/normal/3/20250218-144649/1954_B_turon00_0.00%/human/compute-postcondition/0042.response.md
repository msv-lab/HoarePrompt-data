Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`; `aa` is a set of unique integers from the list `a`; `cnt` is 1; `ans` is the input integer `n`; the current element of `a` at index `i` is equal to `tmp`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
