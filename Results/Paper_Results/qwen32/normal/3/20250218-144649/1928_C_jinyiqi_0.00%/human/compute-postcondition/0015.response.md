The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. In each iteration, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x`. If it is, it appends `i` to `output1` and `x / i` to `output2`. This process continues until all divisors up to the square root of `x` have been found.

After all iterations are complete, `output1` will contain all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` will contain the corresponding complementary divisors (i.e., `x / i`).

**Output State:** **`output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` contains the corresponding complementary divisors.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `output1` will have all the smaller divisors of `x` up to its square root, and `output2` will have the larger divisors that pair with them to multiply back to `x`.
