Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ x < n â‰¤ 10^9, `output1` is a list with the new element `i` appended, `output2` is a list (its contents depend on whether `x % i == 0`), `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

In simpler terms, `i` has been added to `output1`, and `i` has been incremented by 1. The values of `x`, `n`, and `output2` remain unchanged.
