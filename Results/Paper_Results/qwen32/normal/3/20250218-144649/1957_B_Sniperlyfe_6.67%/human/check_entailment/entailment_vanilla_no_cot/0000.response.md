Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to fill the sequence with numbers that are one less than the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, but it does not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    i = 0
    
    # Distribute k such that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the OR of the numbers is maximized
    while k > 0:
        if i >= n:
            break
        bit = 1
        while bit <= k and i < n:
            nums[i] |= bit
            k -= bit
            bit <<= 1
            i += 1
    
    # If there's still remaining k, add it to the last element
    if k > 0:
        nums[-1] += k
    
    return nums
```

In this corrected version, we distribute the value `k` into the sequence `nums` in such a way that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized. This is achieved by setting the least significant bits to 1 first, which maximizes the number of 1s in the final OR result.
