The code snippet `nums[-1] += k` increments the last element of the list `nums` by the value of `k`. Given the initial state, the last element of `nums` was `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. After the operation, the last element of `nums` becomes `((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1) + k`.

Hence, the updated output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is updated to `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`, `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first `n-1` elements set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, the last element set to `((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1) + k`, and all other elements initialized to 0, `i` is `n - 1`.**
