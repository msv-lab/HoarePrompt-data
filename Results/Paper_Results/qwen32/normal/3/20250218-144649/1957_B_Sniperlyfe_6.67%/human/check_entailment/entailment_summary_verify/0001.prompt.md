You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`. It returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first `n-1` elements are set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the last element is `((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1) + k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program in detail to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The program's goal is to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all zeros. This list will hold the sequence of integers that satisfy the conditions.
2. **Loop through each position in the sequence**:
   - For each position `i` in the sequence, it calculates `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This expression calculates the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but all set to 1.
     - For example, if `k` is 5 (binary `101`), `k.bit_length()` is 3, so `(1 << 3 - 1) - 1` is `(1 << 2) - 1` which is `3` (binary `11`).
   - It assigns this value to `nums[i]` and subtracts it from `k`.
3. **Adjust the last element**: After the loop, the last element in `nums` is incremented by the remaining value of `k` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
4. **Return the sequence**: The function returns the constructed sequence `nums`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Instead, it fills the sequence with the largest possible numbers that fit within the bit length of `k`. This approach does not consider how to distribute the bits to maximize the number of 1s.
- For instance, in the second test case (`n=2`, `k=3`), the program would output `[3, 0]` (binary `11` and `00`), which results in a bitwise OR of `11` (2 ones). However, the correct output should be `[1, 2]` (binary `01` and `10`), which results in a bitwise OR of `11` (2 ones), but there are other possible sequences like `[3, 0]` itself, but the problem specifies maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, and the given program does not guarantee that.
- The program does not consider distributing the bits optimally among the sequence elements to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Correctness:
Given the issues described above, the program does not necessarily produce the correct output for all cases, as it does not guarantee maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

Correctness: **False**
