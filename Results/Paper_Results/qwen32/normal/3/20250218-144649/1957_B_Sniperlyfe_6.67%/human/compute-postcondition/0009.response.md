Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is updated to `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`, `nums` is a list of length `n` with `nums[0]` set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `nums[1]` set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `nums[2]` set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and all other elements initialized to 0, `i` is 2**. 

In simple terms, the value of `k` is reduced by the value of `nums[2]`, which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
