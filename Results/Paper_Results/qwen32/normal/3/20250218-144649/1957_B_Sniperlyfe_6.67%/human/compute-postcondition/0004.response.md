The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9 updated to `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`, `nums` is a list of length `n` with `nums[0]` set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements initialized to 0, `i` is 1**
