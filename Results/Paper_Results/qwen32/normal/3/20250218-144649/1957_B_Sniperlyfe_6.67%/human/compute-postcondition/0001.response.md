The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1, because `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and the loop will iterate over this sequence. 

Given the state before the loop starts, `n` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, which means the loop can execute as long as `n` is within this range. The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts because it will be automatically assigned values by the `range` function.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute. The state is already valid for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is not yet initialized**
