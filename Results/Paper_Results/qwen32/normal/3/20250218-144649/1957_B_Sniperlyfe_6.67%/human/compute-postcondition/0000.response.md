The code snippet creates a list named `nums` with `n` elements, all initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are provided in the initial state. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases, `n` is the size of the list to be created, and `k` is another integer provided for each test case. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.**
