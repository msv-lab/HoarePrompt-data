To determine the output state, we need to understand the components of the `nums` list based on the provided initial state and the operations described.

1. **Understanding `k`**:
   - `k` is updated to `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`. 
   - `k.bit_length() - 1` gives the highest bit position set in `k`. 
   - `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`.

2. **Understanding `nums`**:
   - `nums` is a list of length `n`.
   - The first `n-1` elements of `nums` are set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
   - The last element of `nums` is `((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1) + k`.
   - All other elements are initialized to 0, but since `nums` is only of length `n`, this doesn't affect the list.

Given the above, the `nums` list will look like this:
- First `n-1` elements: `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`
- Last element: `((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1) + k`

Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first `n-1` elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the last element is `((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1) + k`.**
