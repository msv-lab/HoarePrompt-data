Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer provided by the user input, `a` is a string provided by the user input that must have at least one character, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`. If `s` is `'0'`, then `x` is `2` if `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `1`. If `s` is not `'0'`, then `x` is `1` if `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `0`. In both cases, `y` is `1` if `s` is `'0'` and `a` is not `'0'`, otherwise `y` is `0` if `s` is `'0'` and `a` is `'0'`, or `y` is `2` if `s` is not `'0'` and `a` is not `'0'`. `s` is the next character in the string `a`.**
