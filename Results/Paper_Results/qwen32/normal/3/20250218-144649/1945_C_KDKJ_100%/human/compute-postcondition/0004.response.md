To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and doesn't need to be adjusted. However, the range is determined by the integer input, which needs to be one less than the previous input for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that the input to `int(input())` must be an integer greater than 0 and `func_1()` has been executed, we need to adjust the input to be one less than the previous input for the loop to continue executing.

Let's denote the previous input as `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was an integer greater than 0, and now it needs to be `x - 1` for the loop to execute again. Since `func_1()` has been executed, we don't need to adjust its state as it's not part of the loop head.

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be an integer greater than 0 (one less than the previous input), `func_1()` has been executed.** 

To be more specific, if the previous input was `x`, the new input should be `x - 1`:
State: **The input to `int(input())` must be `x - 1` where `x` is the previous input and `x > 1`, `func_1()` has been executed.**
