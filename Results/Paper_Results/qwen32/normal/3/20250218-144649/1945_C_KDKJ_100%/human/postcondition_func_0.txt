The function reads a positive integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. It calculates and prints an index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n/2` and `i`, under the condition that the number of '0's in the left part of the string (up to index `i`) is at least half the length of that part, and the number of '1's in the right part of the string (from index `i` to the end) is at least half the length of that part.
