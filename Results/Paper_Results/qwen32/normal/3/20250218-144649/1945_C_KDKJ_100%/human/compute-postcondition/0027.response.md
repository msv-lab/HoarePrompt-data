The code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `lsum`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `lsum` is now equal to `i`. The other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]; ans` is `-1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`.**
