Postcondition: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]; n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`. Additionally, `left * 2` is greater than or equal to `lsum` and `right * 2` is greater than or equal to `rsum`. The value of `ans` is updated to `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the previous value of `ans` (which was `-1`). Otherwise, `ans` remains `-1`.**
