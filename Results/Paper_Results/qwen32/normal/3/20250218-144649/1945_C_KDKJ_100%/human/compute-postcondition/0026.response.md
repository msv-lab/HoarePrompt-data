The code snippet assigns the value of `S[i][0]` to the variable `left`. This means that `left` will take the value of the first element of the `i`-th sublist in the list `S`.

Given that the initial state specifies `S` as a list of lists where each sublist contains two elements, and `ans` is `-1`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, the only variable that changes is `left`.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xf, yf]]; ans` is `-1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`.**
