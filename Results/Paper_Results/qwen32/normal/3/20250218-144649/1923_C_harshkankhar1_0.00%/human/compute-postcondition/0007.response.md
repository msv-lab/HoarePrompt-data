Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1]` to `a[n]` are the integers read from the input; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `b[i - 1] + x`, with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `i` is incremented by 1; `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2.**

In simple terms, the value of `x` is updated to be 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise it is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
