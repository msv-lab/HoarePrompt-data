To determine the output of the `print(*a)` statement, we need to understand the construction of the list `a` based on the initial state provided.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization of `a`**:
   - `a` is a list where `a[0]` is initialized to 0.
   - For `i` from 1 to `n`, `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the elements from `a[0]` to `a[i-1]`.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - Given that `a[0] = 0`, the cumulative sum starts from 0.
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]`, it is computed as the sum of all previous elements in `a` up to `a[i-1]`.

3. **Understanding the List `a`**:
   - Since `a[0] = 0`, `a[1]` will be `a[0] = 0`.
   - `a[2]` will be `a[0] + a[1] = 0 + 0 = 0`.
   - This pattern continues, so `a[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n` will be 0 because each `a[i]` is the sum of previous elements which are all 0.

4. **Resulting List `a`**:
   - The list `a` will be `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]` with a total of `n + 1` elements (including `a[0]`).

### Conclusion:
The list `a` will consist of `n + 1` zeros because each element from `a[1]` to `a[n]` is the cumulative sum of the previous elements, all of which are 0.

### Output:
Output: **0 0 0 ... 0 (where there are n+1 zeros)**

This output reflects the fact that the list `a` contains `n + 1` zeros, as derived from the cumulative sum calculation starting from `a[0] = 0`.
