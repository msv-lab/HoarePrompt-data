To determine the final state of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

The loop continues to execute until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, which indicates that the value `ps` has been visited before, thus detecting a cycle. During each iteration, the loop appends `a[ps - 1]` to the `paths` list and updates `ps` to `p[ps - 1]`. The `vis` list is used to track visited indices, and the loop terminates when a previously visited index is encountered.

Given:
- `vis` is initialized with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1.
- `paths` is an empty list at the start, and during each iteration, `a[ps - 1]` is appended to `paths`.
- `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` in each iteration.
- The loop terminates when `vis[ps - 1]` is 1.

Let's consider the output state after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `paths` contains the first value `a[ps - 1]`.
- After 2 iterations: `paths` contains the first two values `a[ps - 1]` and `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`.
- After 3 iterations: `paths` contains the first three values `a[ps - 1]`, `a[p[ps - 1] - 1]`, and `a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1]`.

The loop will continue until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1. When this happens, `ps` will be a value that has been visited before, indicating the start of a cycle.

Final Output State:
- `paths` will contain the sequence of values from `a` up to and including the value that causes the cycle detection.
- `ps` will be the value that causes the cycle detection.
- `vis` will have `vis[ps - 1]` set to 1, indicating the cycle.
- Other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, `i`) will remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the cycle detection, `ps` is the value causing the cycle detection, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected, `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` including the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]` up to the value causing the cycle detection, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`, and `i` is `min(k, len(paths))`. Additionally, `resb` is the greater of the two values `resb` and `ress`.**

In simpler terms, the loop continues until a cycle is detected, and the final state includes the sequence of values collected in `paths` up to the point of cycle detection, with the `ps` variable holding the value that caused the cycle.
