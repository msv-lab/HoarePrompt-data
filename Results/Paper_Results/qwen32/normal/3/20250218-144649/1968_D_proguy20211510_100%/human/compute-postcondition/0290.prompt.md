You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are positive integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. p is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and n (inclusive), and a is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
        
    #State: All test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the output is either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of `resb` and `ress`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and two lists `p` and `a` of length `n`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided values, where `n` is the number of elements in the lists, `k` is another positive integer, `P_B` and `P_S` are positions, and `p` and `a` are lists of integers.
