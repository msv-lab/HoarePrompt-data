### Reasoning:
The given Python program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the program's approach and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, which represent the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It then reads the permutation list `p` and the score list `a`.

2. **Path Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the path that each player will follow, starting from their respective positions (`P_B` and `P_S`).
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to detect cycles in the permutation.
   - For each player, it collects the scores they would accumulate at each step until a cycle is detected.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - For each player, the program calculates the maximum possible score they can achieve within `k` turns.
   - It does this by iterating over the path and calculating the score for each possible number of turns, considering the scores accumulated in the path and the remaining turns.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After calculating the maximum scores for both players, the program compares them.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, or "Draw" if their scores are equal.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where `k` is very large (up to \(10^9\)) by only considering the path up to the point where a cycle is detected, as the scores will repeat in a cycle.
   - It also handles the case where `P_B` and `P_S` are the same, ensuring that the paths are calculated correctly and compared properly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. It efficiently handles the large input sizes and edge cases as specified in the problem description.
