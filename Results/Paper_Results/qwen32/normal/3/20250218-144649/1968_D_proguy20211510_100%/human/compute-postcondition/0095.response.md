The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state provides a detailed description of various variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, `ress`, or `i`.

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output will be exactly the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
