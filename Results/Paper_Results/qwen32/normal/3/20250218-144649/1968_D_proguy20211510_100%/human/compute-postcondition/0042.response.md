The code appends `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. Given the initial state, `paths` initially contains two elements, both equal to `a[ps - 1]`. After appending `a[ps - 1]` again, `paths` will have three elements, all equal to `a[ps - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the loop to terminate (i.e., `vis[pb - 1]` is 1), `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` (updated), `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `paths` is a list containing the elements `[a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1]]`, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
