Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each of the t test cases, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` are positive integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `p` is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and n (inclusive); `a` is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive); the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `YES` is 'YES'; `NO` is 'NO'; `MOD` is 1000000007; `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pathb, paths = [], []
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[pb - 1] = 1
    while True:
        pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
        if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
            break
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[ps - 1] = 1
    while True:
        paths.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]
        if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
            break
    resb, ress = 0, 0
    preb, pres = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(pathb)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
        preb += pathb[i]
        resb = max(resb, curr)
    for i in range(len(paths)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
        pres += paths[i]
        ress = max(ress, curr)
    if resb > ress:
        print('Bodya')
    elif ress > resb:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` and `ps` are the values causing the loop to terminate, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except for the indices corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, which are set to 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`, and `i` is `min(k, len(paths))`. Additionally, `resb` is the greater of the two values `resb` and `ress`. If `ress` was greater than `resb`, `resb` is updated to the value of `ress`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers; `pb` and `ps` are the values causing the cycle detection; `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input; `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected; `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` including the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]` up to the value causing the cycle detection; `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1; `preb` is the sum of `pathb` elements up to the point where the loop terminates; `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`; `i` is the number of completed iterations of the loop, which is the minimum of `len(paths)` and `k`; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for `j` in the range of the loop; and `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `ps` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list that now includes the elements from `a` visited before a cycle was detected, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` visited before the cycle was detected, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`, `i` is `min(len(pathb), k)`, `resb` is the maximum of `preb + pathb[j] * (k - j)` for `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, `resb` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `resb` is updated to `ress`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
