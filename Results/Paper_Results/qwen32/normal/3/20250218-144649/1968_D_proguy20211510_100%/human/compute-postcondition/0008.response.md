Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a` retain their initial values as no operations were performed on them. The variables `pathb` and `paths` were initialized as empty lists.
