The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state describes a variety of variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of any of the described variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions.
2. The string `'Draw'` is directly specified in the `print` statement.
3. There are no calculations or variable manipulations affecting the output of this particular statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
