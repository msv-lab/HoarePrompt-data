Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the loop to terminate (i.e., `vis[pb - 1]` is 1), `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` (updated), `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `paths` is a list containing the elements `[a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1]]`, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement exits the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables. All other conditions and variable states remain the same as described in the initial state.
