Given the `while True` loop, the loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body, which is not provided in the code snippet. Therefore, no specific state adjustments are needed to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. The loop will simply repeat the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1. Since `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
