Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the loop to terminate (i.e., `vis[pb - 1]` is 1), `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The `vis` list is re-initialized to a list of `n` zeros, which means all the previously visited nodes are now marked as unvisited. All other variables retain their initial values.
