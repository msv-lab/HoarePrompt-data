The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('Sasha')
```

This statement directly prints the string 'Sasha' to the console. The initial state and the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, `ress`, and `i` do not affect the execution of this specific `print` statement because it does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string 'Sasha'.

Output: **Sasha**
