Given the initial state described, we need to determine the output of the `print('Sasha')` statement.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and their Descriptions:**
   - `t`: A positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `n`: An integer.
   - `k`: An integer.
   - `pb`: The value causing the cycle detection.
   - `ps`: The value causing the cycle detection.
   - `p`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `a`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `pathb`: A list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected.
   - `paths`: A list containing the sequence of values from `a` including the newly appended value `a[ps - 1]` up to the value causing the cycle detection.
   - `vis`: A list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1.
   - `resb`: The maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop.
   - `ress`: The maximum value of `pres + paths[j] * (k - j)` for `j` in the range of the loop.
   - `preb`: The sum of `pathb` elements up to the point where the loop terminates.
   - `pres`: The sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`.
   - `i`: The number of completed iterations of the loop, which is the minimum of `len(paths)` and `k`.
   - `ress` is greater than `resb`.

2. **The Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('Sasha')`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement `print('Sasha')` will simply output the string `'Sasha'`. None of the variables or their values are directly involved in the print statement. The string `'Sasha'` is explicitly provided.

### Final Output:
Output: **Sasha**
