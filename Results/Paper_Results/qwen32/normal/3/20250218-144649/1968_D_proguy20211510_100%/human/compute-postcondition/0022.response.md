In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless a `break` statement is encountered within the loop body. Since the loop body is omitted, we can assume that there are no conditions within the loop that would cause it to break or terminate. Therefore, the loop will always execute one more time regardless of the current state of the variables.

Given that the loop will always execute one more time, we do not need to adjust any variables to ensure that the loop can proceed. We simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]` twice, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1. Since `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
