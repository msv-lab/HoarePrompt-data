Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `ps` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list that contains at least one element from `a`, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` visited before the cycle was detected, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1, `preb` is `pathb[0]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 1, `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `pathb[0] * k`, `ress` is 0, `curr` is `pathb[0] * k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but the values of all the variables remain unchanged.
