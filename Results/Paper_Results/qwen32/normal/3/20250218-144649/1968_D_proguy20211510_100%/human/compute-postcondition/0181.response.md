The code snippet provided is `pres += paths[i]`. This line updates the value of `pres` by adding the value of `paths[i]` to it. 

Here's the impact on the variables:
- `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[i]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the updated state of `pres` will be the sum of its previous value and the value at index `i` in the `paths` list.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the cycle detection, `ps` is the value causing the cycle detection, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected, `paths` is a list containing at least one element from `a`, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in the range of the loop, `ress` is the maximum value between its previous value and `curr`, `preb` is the sum of `pathb` elements up to the point where the loop terminates, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`**.
