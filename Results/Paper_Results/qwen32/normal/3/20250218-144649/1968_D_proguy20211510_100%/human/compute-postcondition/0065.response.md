Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the loop to terminate, `ps` is the value causing the loop to terminate, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing at least one element, `paths` is a list containing all the elements from `a` corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except for the indices corresponding to the path taken until the cycle is detected, which are set to 1, `resb` is `max(resb, curr)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is the original value of `preb` plus `pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, and `i` is `i + 2`. If `k < i + 1`, the loop or statement is broken out of.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `curr` is recalculated to be `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. The value of `i` is incremented by 2. All other variables retain their previous values.
