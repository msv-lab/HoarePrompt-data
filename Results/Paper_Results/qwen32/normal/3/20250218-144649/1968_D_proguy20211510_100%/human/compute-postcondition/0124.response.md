The code snippet marks the position `ps - 1` in the `vis` list as visited by setting it to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is in the `vis` list at index `ps - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value causing the cycle detection, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from `a` before the cycle was detected, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `preb` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(pathb))` elements of `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`, and `i` is `min(k, len(paths))`. Additionally, `resb` is the greater of the two values `resb` and `ress`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the loop is broken out of.**
