Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the condition used to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is not sufficient to correctly determine if the desired configuration is achievable.

To determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to consider the following:
- The net effect of `n` moves can be any even number between `-n` and `n` (inclusive), because each move either adds or subtracts 1 cube.
- Therefore, the condition to check should be whether `m` can be reached by an even number of moves, which translates to checking if `n - m` is even and non-negative, or `m - n` is even and non-negative.

The correct condition should be:
- `abs(n - m) % 2 == 0` to ensure the difference is even, and
- `n >= m` to ensure that it's possible to reach `m` cubes by adding or removing cubes within `n` moves.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version of the program correctly checks if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
