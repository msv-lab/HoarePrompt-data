### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if it is possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing one cube.

The key insight here is that:
- Each move either adds or subtracts one cube.
- Therefore, the net effect of `n` moves can be represented as `n - m` (where `m` is the final number of cubes).
- For Nikita to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each pair of moves (one add and one subtract) results in no net change, and if `n - m` is even, it means the number of unmatched moves (either all adds or all subtracts) can be evenly paired.
- Additionally, `n - m` must be non-negative because you cannot remove more cubes than you have added (i.e., `n` cannot be less than `m`).

The provided program checks exactly this condition: `if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)`. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes", otherwise "No".

### Example Walkthrough:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
   - `n - m = 0`, which is even and non-negative.
   - Expected Output: "Yes"
   - Program Output: "Yes"

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
   - `n - m = -2`, which is even but negative.
   - Expected Output: "No"
   - Program Output: "No"

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
   - `n - m = 2`, which is even and non-negative.
   - Expected Output: "Yes"
   - Program Output: "Yes"

The program correctly handles all these cases, and the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Correctness: **True**
