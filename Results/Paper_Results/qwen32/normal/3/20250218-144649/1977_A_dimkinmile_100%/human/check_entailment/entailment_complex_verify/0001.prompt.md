You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. If (n - m) is even and non-negative, then n is greater than or equal to m with the difference (n - m) being an even number. Otherwise, either (n - m) is not even or (n - m) is negative.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `m` for each of `t` test cases. For each test case, it checks if the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative. If so, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing a single cube.

Let's analyze the solution step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read first.
   - For each test case, two integers `n` (number of moves) and `m` (desired number of cubes) are read.

2. **Logic:**
   - The key insight is that each move either adds or removes one cube.
   - To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even and non-negative.
     - **Even Difference:** This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) results in no net change, or a net change of ±2 cubes. Therefore, the total difference `n - m` must be even to be achievable.
     - **Non-negative Difference:** This ensures that `n` is at least as large as `m`, which means it's possible to add enough cubes to reach `m` (or remove enough cubes if `m` is 0).

3. **Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` handles the logic for each test case.
   - It reads `n` and `m`, checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, and prints "Yes" if both conditions are met, otherwise "No".

### Evaluation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described above. It checks both conditions: whether the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative. If both conditions are satisfied, it correctly outputs "Yes"; otherwise, it outputs "No".

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description and the logic explained.

**Correctness: True**
