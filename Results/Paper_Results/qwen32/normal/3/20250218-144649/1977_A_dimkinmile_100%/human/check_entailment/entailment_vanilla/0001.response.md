### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing a single cube.

Let's analyze the solution step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read first.
   - For each test case, two integers `n` (number of moves) and `m` (desired number of cubes) are read.

2. **Logic:**
   - The key insight is that each move either adds or removes one cube.
   - To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even and non-negative.
     - **Even Difference:** This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) results in no net change, or a net change of Â±2 cubes. Therefore, the total difference `n - m` must be even to be achievable.
     - **Non-negative Difference:** This ensures that `n` is at least as large as `m`, which means it's possible to add enough cubes to reach `m` (or remove enough cubes if `m` is 0).

3. **Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` handles the logic for each test case.
   - It reads `n` and `m`, checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, and prints "Yes" if both conditions are met, otherwise "No".

### Evaluation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described above. It checks both conditions: whether the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative. If both conditions are satisfied, it correctly outputs "Yes"; otherwise, it outputs "No".

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description and the logic explained.

**Correctness: True**
