Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `decoded` is an empty list, and `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry if added). If `chr(c)` was not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` now contains one entry `{chr(c): char}` and the loop or conditional statement is broken out of. If `chr(c)` was already in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` remains unchanged.**
