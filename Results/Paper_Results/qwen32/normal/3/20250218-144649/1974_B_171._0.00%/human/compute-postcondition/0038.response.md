Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters, `char` is `next_char`, `c` is the ASCII value of the first character from 'a' to 'z' that was not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping` includes the entry `{chr(c): next_char}`, and `decoded` now contains the character `chr(c)`.**

Explanation: The code appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value `c` to the list `decoded`. The values of `encoded`, `char`, `c`, and `mapping` remain unchanged except that `decoded` now includes the newly appended character.
