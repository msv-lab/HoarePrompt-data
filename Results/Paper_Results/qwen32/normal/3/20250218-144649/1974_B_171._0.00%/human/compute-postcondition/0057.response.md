Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters, `char` is `next_next_char`. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` has an additional element `mapping[next_next_char]` appended to it. Otherwise, `mapping` includes a new entry `{chr(c): next_next_char}` where `chr(c)` is the first lowercase Latin letter not already in `mapping.values()`, and `decoded` now contains the character `chr(c)` appended to it.**
