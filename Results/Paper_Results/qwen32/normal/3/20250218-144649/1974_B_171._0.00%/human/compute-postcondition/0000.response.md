The code snippet initializes an empty dictionary named `mapping`. This dictionary does not affect the `encoded` string variable, which remains unchanged. Since the function will be called multiple times with different strings, the state of `mapping` will be reset to an empty dictionary each time the function is called. The `encoded` string's state is preserved across function calls, but it is not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `mapping` is an empty dictionary.**
