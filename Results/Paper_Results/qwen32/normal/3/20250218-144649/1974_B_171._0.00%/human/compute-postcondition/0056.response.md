The code snippet `decoded.append(chr(c))` appends the character `chr(c)` to the list `decoded`. Given the initial state, `chr(c)` is the first lowercase Latin letter not already in `mapping.values()`. This means that `decoded` will now include this character at the end of the list.

Since the loop breaks after adding the entry `{chr(c): char}` to `mapping`, the values of `mapping` and the condition for `chr(c)` do not change further in this context.

Output State: **`mapping` includes the entry {chr(c): char} where chr(c) is the first lowercase Latin letter not already in `mapping.values()`. The loop breaks after adding this entry. `decoded` is a list that includes all previous elements plus the new element `chr(c)` at the end.**
