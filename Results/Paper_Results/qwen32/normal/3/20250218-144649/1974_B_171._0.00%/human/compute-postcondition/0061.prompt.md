You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function will be called multiple times (up to 10^4 times) with different strings, each having a length between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5, and the total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: `decoded` is a list of characters where each unique character in `encoded` is replaced by a unique character from 'a' to 'z' in the order of their first appearance, and `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each unique character in `decoded` back to its corresponding character in `encoded`.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string formed by joining the characters in the list `decoded`. Each unique character in the original `encoded` string is replaced by a unique character from 'a' to 'z' in the order of their first appearance.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a new string where each unique character in the original `encoded` string is replaced by a unique character from 'a' to 'z' in the order of their first appearance.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string formed by joining the characters in the list `decoded`. Each unique character in the original `encoded` string is replaced by a unique character from 'a' to 'z' in the order of their first appearance.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
