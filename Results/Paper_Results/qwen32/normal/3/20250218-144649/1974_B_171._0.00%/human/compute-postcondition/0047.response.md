The only variable in the loop head is `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `c`. The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, which means `c` will take on values from 97 to 122 (inclusive).

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 97. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1, so it should be 98. The other variables (`mapping`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`c` is 98**
