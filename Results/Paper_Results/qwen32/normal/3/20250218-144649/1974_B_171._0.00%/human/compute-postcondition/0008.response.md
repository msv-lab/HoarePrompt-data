The code snippet adds an entry to the `mapping` dictionary where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. This means that `mapping` will no longer be an empty dictionary but will contain one key-value pair.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `mapping` is a dictionary with one entry `{chr(c): char}`, `decoded` is an empty list, and `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry just added). Additionally, `chr(c)` is not a value in the `mapping` dictionary (except for the new entry just added).**
