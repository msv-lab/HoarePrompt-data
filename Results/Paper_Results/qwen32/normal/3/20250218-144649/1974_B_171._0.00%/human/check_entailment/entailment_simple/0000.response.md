Reasoning:
The program provided is incorrect for the given problem. The task requires decoding a string that was encoded by replacing each character with its symmetric counterpart from a sorted list of distinct characters. The provided program does not implement this decoding process correctly. Instead, it attempts to create a mapping from the encoded string to a sequence of characters 'a' to 'z' based on their first appearance, which is not the intended decoding process.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Building the Auxiliary String `r`:** The program does not construct the auxiliary string `r` which contains all distinct characters of the encoded string `b` in alphabetical order. This step is crucial for finding the symmetric character.

2. **Decoding Process:** The program attempts to decode the string by mapping each unique character in the encoded string to a character from 'a' to 'z' in the order of their first appearance. This is not the correct approach. Instead, for each character in the encoded string, we need to find its symmetric character in the auxiliary string `r`.

3. **Symmetric Character Replacement:** The correct decoding process involves finding the position of the character in the auxiliary string `r` and replacing it with the character at the symmetric position from the end of `r`.

To correctly decode the string, the program should:

- Extract all distinct characters from the encoded string and sort them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
- For each character in the encoded string, find its index in `r` and replace it with the character at the symmetric position from the end of `r`.

Given the above points, the provided program does not perform the required decoding steps correctly.

Correctness: **False**
