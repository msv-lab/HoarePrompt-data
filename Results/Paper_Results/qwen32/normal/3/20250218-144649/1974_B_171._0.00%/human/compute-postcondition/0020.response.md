The provided code snippet `decoded.append(chr(c))` appends the character representation of `c` to the `decoded` list. However, the variable `c` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `c` is an integer that represents a valid ASCII value (since `chr(c)` is used to convert it to a character), the value of `c` is not specified.

Since `c` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact character that will be appended to the `decoded` list. However, we can say that `decoded` will now contain one additional element, which is the character corresponding to the integer `c`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `mapping` is `{'a': char}`, `decoded` is a list containing one additional element which is `chr(c)`, and `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry `'a': char` if added).**
