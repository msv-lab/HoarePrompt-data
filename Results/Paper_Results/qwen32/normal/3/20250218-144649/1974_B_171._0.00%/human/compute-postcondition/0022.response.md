The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `encoded` string. If `encoded` has at least one more character, the loop will execute again for the next character.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the last character processed from the `encoded` string. For the loop to execute one more time, `encoded` must have at least one more character. The next `char` will be the next character in the `encoded` string.

Let's assume the last character processed was `encoded[len(encoded) - 1]`. The next character to be processed will be `encoded[len(encoded) - 1 + 1]` or simply `encoded[len(encoded)]` if we consider the current length of `encoded` before the next iteration starts.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters. `char` is the next character in `encoded`**.

Since we don't know the exact next character, we can denote it as `encoded[len(encoded) - 1 + 1]` or `encoded[len(encoded)]` in the next iteration. For simplicity, let's denote the next character as `next_char`.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters. `char` is `next_char`**.
