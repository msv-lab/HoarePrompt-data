The only variable in the loop head is `char`, which iterates over `encoded`. For the loop to execute, `encoded` must contain at least one character. The variables `mapping` and `decoded` are not part of the loop head, so we do not need to adjust them to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list**
