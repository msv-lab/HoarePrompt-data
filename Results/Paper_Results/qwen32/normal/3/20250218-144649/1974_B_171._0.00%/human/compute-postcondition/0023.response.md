The code snippet appends the value of `mapping[char]` to the list `decoded`. Given the initial state, `char` is `next_char`, so the value to be appended is `mapping[next_char]`. The values of `encoded` and `char` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two characters; `char` is `next_char`; `decoded` has an additional element `mapping[next_char]` appended to it.**
