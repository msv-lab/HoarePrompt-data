The loop iterates over all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'. It checks if the current character `chr(c)` is not already in the values of the `mapping` dictionary. If it's not, it adds an entry `{chr(c): char}` to the `mapping` dictionary and breaks out of the loop. Since the loop breaks after the first successful addition to the `mapping` dictionary, the loop will only execute once in total, regardless of the number of iterations specified in the loop range.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the `mapping` dictionary will end up with exactly one entry, which will be the first lowercase letter that is not already a value in the `mapping` dictionary. Since `mapping` is initially empty, the first character 'a' will be added to the `mapping` dictionary with the value `char`.

Therefore, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `mapping` is `{'a': char}`, `decoded` is an empty list, and `char` is not in `mapping` (except for the new entry `'a': char` if added).**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, the `mapping` dictionary will have one entry mapping the character 'a' to `char`, and no other variables will be changed.
