The code assigns the value of `char` to the key `chr(c)` in the dictionary `mapping`. Given that `c` is 98, `chr(c)` will be `'b'`. Therefore, the dictionary `mapping` will have a new key-value pair where the key is `'b'` and the value is `char`.

Output State: **`c` is 98; `mapping` has a new key-value pair `'b': char`**.
