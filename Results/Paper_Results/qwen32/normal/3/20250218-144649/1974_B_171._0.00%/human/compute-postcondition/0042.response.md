The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. This means `c` will take on integer values from 97 (ASCII value for 'a') to 122 (ASCII value for 'z'). To ensure the loop executes, `c` should be initialized to the starting value of this range, which is 97.

The other variables mentioned in the task description (`encoded`, `char`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `next_next_char`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted in this context.

State: **`c` is 97**
