### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the logic of the program and verify it against the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The goal is to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts given:
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.

Maxim can choose to buy yogurts individually or in pairs at the promotion price. The goal is to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `n` yogurts.

#### Program Analysis:
The program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts `n`, the price of one yogurt `a`, and the price of two yogurts on promotion `b`.

The logic in the program is as follows:
1. **If `n` is odd**:
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts individually (2 * a) is less than the promotion price (b), then buy all yogurts individually.
   - Otherwise, buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and buy the remaining yogurt individually.
2. **If `n` is even**:
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts individually (2 * a) is less than the promotion price (b), then buy all yogurts individually.
   - Otherwise, buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.

#### Verification with Test Cases:
Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases.

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9), which is false.
   - Therefore, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (1 * 9 = 9).
   - **Output: 9** (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9), which is false.
   - Therefore, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (1 * 9 + 5 = 14).
   - **Output: 14** (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11), which is true.
   - Therefore, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (5 * 3 = 15).
   - **Output: 15** (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11), which is true.
   - Therefore, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (5 * 4 = 20).
   - **Output: 20** (Correct)

#### Evaluation:
The program correctly handles the logic for both even and odd values of `n` and correctly compares the cost of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs at the promotion price. The annotated code confirms that the program follows the intended logic and produces the correct output for the provided test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: True**

The program is correct and accurately computes the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts under the given conditions.
