To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to evaluate the expression `n // 2 * b + a` based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it is part of the context).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The condition `2 * a < b` is provided but does not affect the calculation of the print statement directly.

### Expression Breakdown:
The expression to be printed is `n // 2 * b + a`.

1. **`n // 2`**: This is integer division of `n` by 2. It gives the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2`.
2. **`n // 2 * b`**: This multiplies the result of the integer division by `b`.
3. **`n // 2 * b + a`**: Finally, `a` is added to the result of the multiplication.

### Output Description:
The output will be the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`. Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated result of the expression.

Output: **n // 2 * b + a (where `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, and `b` is an integer)**
