Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.**
