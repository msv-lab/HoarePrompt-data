Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if n % 2:
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b + a)
    elif 2 * a < b:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print(n // 2 * b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `n` is odd, the condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, the condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `2 * a < b`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. The parity of `n` (odd or even) does not affect the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. The relationship between `2 * a` and `b` holds true, i.e., if `2 * a < b`, the condition is true; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. The parity of `n` (odd or even) does not affect the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
