To determine what will be printed when the `print(a * n)` statement is executed, we need to understand the values of `a` and `n` based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
2. `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
3. The condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
4. The condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `n` is even and `2 * a < b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

### Key Points:
- The condition `2 * a < b` does not affect the calculation of `a * n` directly. It only affects the relationship between `a` and `b` based on the parity of `n`.
- The output of the print statement is simply the product of `a` and `n`.

### Calculation:
The print statement `print(a * n)` will output the product of the integer `a` and the integer `n`.

### Output Description:
The output of the print statement is the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n (where a and n are integers read from the input)**
