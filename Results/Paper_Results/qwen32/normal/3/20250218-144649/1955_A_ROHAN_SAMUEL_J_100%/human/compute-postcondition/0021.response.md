To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the information provided in the initial state and analyze the code step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\). However, `t` does not appear to be used in the provided code snippet.
2. `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
3. The condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
4. The same condition `2 * a < b` holds true if `n` is even and `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(n // 2 * b)
```

- `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2, which means it divides `n` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
- The result of `n // 2` is then multiplied by `b`.

### Output Determination:
Since the exact values of `n` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. The expression `n // 2 * b` represents the product of `b` and the integer division of `n` by 2.

### Final Output:
The code will print the result of `n // 2 * b`, which is the product of `b` and the integer division of `n` by 2.

Output: **n // 2 * b (where n is an integer read from the input and b is an integer read from the input)**
