### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior, especially in light of the function summary and the edge cases mentioned in the original assessment.

#### Program Analysis

The program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts based on the prices `a` and `b`.

1. **Case 1: `n` is odd**
   - The program first checks if `n` is odd using `n % 2`.
   - If `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n`.
   - If `n` is odd and `2 * a >= b`, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a`.

2. **Case 2: `n` is even**
   - The program checks if `n` is even using `elif not n % 2`.
   - If `n` is even and `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n`.
   - If `n` is even and `2 * a >= b`, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b`.

#### Function Summary and Edge Cases

The function summary indicates that the function processes each test case by checking whether `n` is odd or even and comparing `2 * a` with `b` to decide the optimal cost calculation.

Let's verify the edge cases and general behavior:

- **Minimum Values**: `n = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`
  - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = b`, the cost should be `1 * 1 = 1`.
  - The program correctly computes `a * n = 1`.

- **Maximum Values**: `n = 100`, `a = 30`, `b = 30`
  - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = b`, the cost should be `50 * 30 = 1500`.
  - The program correctly computes `n // 2 * b = 1500`.

- **Promotion Cheaper**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`, the cost should be `3 * 5 = 15`.
  - The program correctly computes `a * n = 15`.

- **Promotion More Expensive**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is even and `2 * a < b`, the cost should be `4 * 5 = 20`.
  - The program correctly computes `a * n = 20`.

- **Promotion Cheaper, Odd `n`**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`, the cost should be `3 * 5 = 15`.
  - The program correctly computes `a * n = 15`.

- **Promotion More Expensive, Odd `n`**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a >= b`, the cost should be `1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
  - The program correctly computes `n // 2 * b + a = 14`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description and the edge cases tested. There is no potential case where the program does not work as expected.

**Correctness: True**.
