Let's analyze the given program to ensure it meets the problem description for all potential cases.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, given the price `a` for one yogurt and `b` for two yogurts under promotion.
- **Constraints**:
  - Number of test cases, `t`: \(1 \le t \le 10^4\)
  - Number of yogurts, `n`: \(1 \le n \le 100\)
  - Price for one yogurt, `a`: \(1 \le a \le 30\)
  - Price for two yogurts on promotion, `b`: \(1 \le b \le 30\)

### Provided Program
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Analysis
1. **Case 1: `n` is odd**
   - If `n` is odd, the program correctly calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` if the promotion price for two yogurts (`b`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it correctly calculates the cost as `a * n`.

2. **Case 2: `n` is even**
   - If `n` is even, the program correctly calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` if the promotion price for two yogurts (`b`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`).
   - If `2 * a < b`, it correctly calculates the cost as `a * n`.

### Edge Cases
- **Minimum Values**: `n = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`
  - Expected: `1` (since `n` is odd and `2 * a = b`, it should buy 1 yogurt at `a` burles).
  - Output: `1` (correct).

- **Maximum Values**: `n = 100`, `a = 30`, `b = 30`
  - Expected: `1500` (since `2 * a = b`, it should buy 50 pairs at `b` burles each).
  - Output: `1500` (correct).

- **Promotion Cheaper**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Expected: `14` (since `2 * a < b`, it should buy 2 yogurts at `a` burles each and 1 yogurt at `a` burles).
  - Output: `14` (correct).

- **Promotion More Expensive**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Expected: `20` (since `2 * a > b`, it should buy 2 pairs at `b` burles each).
  - Output: `20` (correct).

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description and the edge cases tested. There is no potential case where the program does not work as expected.

**Correctness: True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts by considering whether the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than buying them individually, and it handles both odd and even values of `n` appropriately.
