### Reasoning:
The program's logic is based on the following principles:
1. **If the number of yogurts `n` is odd**:
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is less than the cost of buying them individually (`2 * a`), Maxim should buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible and then buy the remaining single yogurt at the regular price (`a`). This is represented by the expression `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to buy all yogurts individually, which is represented by `a * n`.
   
2. **If the number of yogurts `n` is even**:
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is less than the cost of buying them individually (`2 * a`), Maxim should buy all yogurts in pairs, which is represented by `n // 2 * b`.
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to buy all yogurts individually, which is represented by `a * n`.

The program correctly implements these conditions and calculates the minimum cost for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
