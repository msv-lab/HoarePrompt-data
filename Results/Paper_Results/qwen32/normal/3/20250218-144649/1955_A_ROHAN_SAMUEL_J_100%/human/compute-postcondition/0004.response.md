To determine the output of the print statement `print(a * n)`, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is given but not directly used in the print statement.
2. **n**: An integer that is currently odd.
3. **a**: An integer.
4. **b**: An integer such that \(2 \times a < b\).

The print statement `print(a * n)` will output the product of `a` and `n`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not specified, the most precise description we can provide is in terms of these variables. We know that `n` is an odd integer, and `a` is an integer that satisfies the condition \(2 \times a < b\).

Therefore, the output will be the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n (where n is an odd integer and a is an integer such that 2 * a < b)**
