You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
We need to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts given the following:
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.

Maxim can choose to buy yogurts individually or in pairs at the promotion price. The goal is to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis
The program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts `n`, the price of one yogurt `a`, and the price of two yogurts on promotion `b`.

The logic in the program is as follows:
1. **If `n` is odd**:
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts individually (2 * a) is less than the promotion price (b), then buy all yogurts individually.
   - Otherwise, buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and buy the remaining yogurt individually.
2. **If `n` is even**:
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts individually (2 * a) is less than the promotion price (b), then buy all yogurts individually.
   - Otherwise, buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.

### Verification with Test Cases
Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases.

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9), which is false.
   - Therefore, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (1 * 9 = 9).
   - **Output: 9** (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9), which is false.
   - Therefore, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (1 * 9 + 5 = 14).
   - **Output: 14** (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11), which is true.
   - Therefore, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (5 * 3 = 15).
   - **Output: 15** (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11), which is true.
   - Therefore, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (5 * 4 = 20).
   - **Output: 20** (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the logic for both even and odd values of `n` and correctly compares the cost of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs at the promotion price. The test cases provided in the problem description are all correctly handled by the program.

**Correctness: True**
