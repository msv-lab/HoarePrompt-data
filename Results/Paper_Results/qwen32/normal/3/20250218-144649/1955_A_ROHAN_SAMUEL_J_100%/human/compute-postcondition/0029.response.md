To determine the output of the `print(a * n)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
   - There is a condition `2 * a < b` which is either true or false, but it does not affect the relationship between `a` and `n` directly.
   - The parity of `n` (whether it is odd or even) does not affect the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`.

2. **Variables**:
   - `a` and `n` are integers whose specific values are not given, but they are part of the input.
   - The expression `a * n` represents the product of `a` and `n`.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print(a * n)` statement will output the product of `a` and `n`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute a specific numerical value for `a * n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n (where a and n are integers read from the input)**
