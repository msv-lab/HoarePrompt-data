Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price of one yogurt (a), and the price of two yogurts on promotion (b). It then calculates the minimum cost to buy n yogurts.

Here's the breakdown of the logic used in the program:

1. **If n is odd**: 
    - If the cost of buying two yogurts (b) is less than twice the cost of buying one yogurt (2 * a), it is more economical to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible and then buy the remaining yogurt individually. This is calculated as `n // 2 * b + a`.
    - If the cost of buying two yogurts (b) is not less than twice the cost of buying one yogurt (2 * a), it is more economical to buy all yogurts individually, which is `a * n`.

2. **If n is even**:
    - If the cost of buying two yogurts (b) is less than twice the cost of buying one yogurt (2 * a), it is more economical to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible, which is `n // 2 * b`.
    - If the cost of buying two yogurts (b) is not less than twice the cost of buying one yogurt (2 * a), it is more economical to buy all yogurts individually, which is `a * n`.

The logic appears correct and handles both odd and even values of n appropriately.

Let's check the example given in the problem statement to verify:

1. For the first test case (n=2, a=5, b=9):
   - Since n is even and 2*a (10) > b (9), the cost is `n//2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.

2. For the second test case (n=3, a=5, b=9):
   - Since n is odd and 2*a (10) > b (9), the cost is `n//2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.

3. For the third test case (n=3, a=5, b=11):
   - Since n is odd and 2*a (10) < b (11), the cost is `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.

4. For the fourth test case (n=4, a=5, b=11):
   - Since n is even and 2*a (10) < b (11), the cost is `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.

The program produces the correct output for the example test cases. Therefore, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
