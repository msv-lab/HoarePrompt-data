Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Summary:
Monocarp wants to throw a party and needs at least two of his friends to attend. Each friend has a distinct best friend, and a friend will only attend the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation. We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least two friends come to the party.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
3. Inside `func_1()`, the number of friends, `n`, is read, followed by the list of best friends, `p`.
4. If `n == 2`, the program immediately prints `2` because both friends must be invited to ensure both attend.
5. For `n > 2`, the program checks if there exists a triplet of friends `i`, `v[i]`, and `v[v[i]]` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a triplet is found, it prints `2` and exits the function.
6. If no such triplet is found, the program prints `3`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Case `n == 2`:** This is handled correctly. Both friends must be invited to ensure both attend, so the program correctly prints `2`.
- **Case `n > 2`:** The program checks for a specific condition: `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition identifies a cycle of length 3 in the best-friend relationships. If such a cycle exists, inviting any two friends in this cycle will ensure that both attend the party, so the program correctly prints `2`.
- **No cycle of length 3:** If no such cycle is found, the program assumes that the minimum number of invitations required is `3`. This is based on the assumption that in the absence of a cycle of length 3, the best strategy is to invite three friends. However, this assumption is not necessarily correct for all configurations. For example, consider a configuration where there are two disjoint cycles of length 2, such as `p = [2, 1, 4, 3]`. In this case, inviting two friends (one from each cycle) would be sufficient, but the program would incorrectly print `3`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all possible configurations correctly. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that if there is no cycle of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required is `3`. Therefore, the program is not always correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
