Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations needed for more complex scenarios beyond the simple cases it checks.

Let's analyze the code:

1. The function `func_1()` is supposed to determine the minimum number of invitations needed for each test case.
2. It first checks if `n == 2`, and if so, it prints `2` because both friends must be invited.
3. For `n > 2`, it checks if there exists a triplet of friends `i`, `v[i]`, and `v[v[i]]` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a triplet exists, it prints `2` because inviting `i` and `v[i]` will bring both `i` and `v[i]` to the party.
4. If no such triplet is found, it defaults to printing `3`.

However, this approach is not comprehensive. There are cases where the minimum number of invitations needed is more than `2` or less than `3` depending on the structure of the best friend relationships.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
In this case, no friend is their own best friend's best friend's best friend, so the code will print `3`. However, the correct answer is `2` because inviting friends `1` and `2` will bring both `1` and `2` to the party (since `1`'s best friend is `2` and `2`'s best friend is `1`).

Another example:
```
5
2 3 4 5 1
```
Here, no triplet `i`, `v[i]`, `v[v[i]]` satisfies `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. The code will print `3`. However, the correct answer is `2` because inviting friends `1` and `2` will bring both `1` and `2` to the party (since `1`'s best friend is `2` and `2`'s best friend is `3`).

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly, and the Correctness is **False**.
