Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem for all cases. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Logic Error**: The program checks if there exists a cycle of length 3 (i.e., `v[v[v[i]]] == i`) and if found, it prints `2`. However, this check is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of invitations needed in all cases. There might be other configurations where more than 2 invitations are necessary to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

2. **Handling General Cases**: The program does not handle general cases where the graph formed by the friendships does not contain a cycle of length 3. For example, if the graph is a cycle of length greater than 3, the program will incorrectly output `3` instead of the correct number of invitations needed.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the case when `n == 2` by printing `2`, but it does not handle all other cases correctly.

To correctly solve the problem, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as finding the minimum number of vertices to cover all edges in the graph formed by the friendships, which is essentially finding a minimum vertex cover in a bipartite graph. This can be done using algorithms like the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm or by using the fact that in a bipartite graph, the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching.

Here is a corrected version of the program that uses a more appropriate algorithm:

```python
def find_minimum_invitations(n, p):
    # Create a graph from the given friendships
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        graph[i].append(p[i - 1])
        graph[p[i - 1]].append(i)
    
    # Function to find augmenting path
    def bfs():
        queue = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if match[i] == 0:
                dist[i] = 0
                queue.append(i)
            else:
                dist[i] = float('inf')
        dist[0] = float('inf')
        while queue:
            u = queue.pop(0)
            if u != 0:
                for v in graph[u]:
                    if dist[match[v]] == float('inf'):
                        dist[match[v]] = dist[u] + 1
                        queue.append(match[v])
        return dist[0] != float('inf')
    
    # Function to find a match
    def dfs(u):
        if u != 0:
            for v in graph[u]:
                if dist[match[v]] == dist[u] + 1:
                    if dfs(match[v]):
                        match[v] = u
                        match[u] = v
                        return True
            dist[u] = float('inf')
            return False
        return True
    
    # Initialize match and dist arrays
    match = [0] * (n + 1)
    dist = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Find maximum matching
    matching = 0
    while bfs():
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if match[i] == 0 and dfs(i):
                matching += 1
    
    # Minimum invitations needed is n - maximum matching
    return n - matching

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(find_minimum_invitations(n, p))
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum number of invitations required by finding the maximum matching in the bipartite graph formed by the friendships and then using the relationship between the minimum vertex cover and the maximum matching.
