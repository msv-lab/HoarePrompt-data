### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
Monocarp wants to invite friends to his party such that at least two of them come. Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i`, and a friend will only come to the party if both they and their best friend receive invitations. 

The core of the problem is to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least two friends attend the party. 

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `p` of best friends.

2. **Handling the Case When `n = 2`:**
   - If `n = 2`, the program always prints `2`. This is correct because with two friends, both need to be invited to ensure that both come to the party.

3. **Handling the Case When `n > 2`:**
   - The program checks if there exists any friend `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a friend exists, it prints `2` and exits.
   - If no such friend is found after checking all friends, it prints `3`.

#### Evaluation of the Condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i`:
- This condition checks if there is a triplet of friends `i`, `v[i]`, and `v[v[i]]` such that `v[v[v[i]]]` loops back to `i`. This implies that there is a cycle of length 3 in the best friend relationships.
- If such a cycle exists, inviting any two friends in this cycle will ensure that both come to the party, hence the program correctly prints `2`.
- If no such cycle exists, the program correctly prints `3` because in the worst case, Monocarp needs to invite three friends to ensure that at least two come to the party.

#### Testing with the Provided Example:
- **First Test Case:**
  - Input: `5`, `3 1 2 5 4`
  - Output: `2` (Correct, as friends 4 and 5 can be invited)
- **Second Test Case:**
  - Input: `4`, `2 3 4 1`
  - Output: `3` (Correct, as friends 1, 2, and 3 need to be invited to ensure at least two come)
- **Third Test Case:**
  - Input: `2`, `2 1`
  - Output: `2` (Correct, as both friends need to be invited)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given problem description and examples.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
