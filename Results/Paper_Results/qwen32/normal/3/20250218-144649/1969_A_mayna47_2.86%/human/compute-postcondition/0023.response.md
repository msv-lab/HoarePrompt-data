Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from the input. It then checks if `n` is 2, in which case it prints `2`. If `n` is greater than 2, it checks a specific condition involving the list. If the condition is met for any element during the iteration, it prints `2` and exits. If the loop completes without meeting the condition, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value.**
