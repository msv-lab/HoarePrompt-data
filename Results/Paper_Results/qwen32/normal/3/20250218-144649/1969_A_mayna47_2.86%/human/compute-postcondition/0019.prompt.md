Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50 and `n` is not equal to 2; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
        print(2)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50 and `n` is not equal to 2; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input. Additionally, `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50 and `n` is not equal to 2; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`]; `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input. Additionally, `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`. `i` is the value from the previous iteration incremented by 1. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i`, the program returns without any value. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50 and `n` is not equal to 2; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`]; `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input. Additionally, `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`. `i` is `i + 1` where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i`, the program returns without any value. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i`, the program returns without any value. Otherwise, the program continues with `i` incremented by 1 and no changes to the other variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
