Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`]; `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input. If `n` equals 2, the program does not perform any additional actions beyond maintaining the initial conditions. Otherwise, the loop has completed all `n` iterations without printing anything.**
