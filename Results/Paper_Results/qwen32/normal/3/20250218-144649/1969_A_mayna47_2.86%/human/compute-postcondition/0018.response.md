Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50 and `n` is not equal to 2; `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`]; `v` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input. Additionally, `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`. `i` is `i + 1` where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i`, the program returns without any value. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables. If `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i`, the program returns without any value. Otherwise, the program continues with `i` incremented by 1 and no changes to the other variables.**
