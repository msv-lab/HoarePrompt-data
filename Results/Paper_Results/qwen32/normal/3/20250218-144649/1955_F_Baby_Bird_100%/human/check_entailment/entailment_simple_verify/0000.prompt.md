You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: result1\nresult2\n...\nresultt (where each resulti is the maximum number of groups of three that can be formed from the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the ith test case, considering the special rule for unpaired elements)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The problem description requires us to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally. Bob wins when the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

Here's the provided program:
```python
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
```

This program can be broken down into the following steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.
3. It calculates a value for each test case using a list comprehension and prints the results.

Let's analyze the logic inside the list comprehension:
- For each count `x` of the numbers (ones, twos, threes, fours), it calculates `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)`.
- The result of this calculation is summed up for all counts.
- Finally, the sum is divided by 3 and converted to a string.

The logic seems to be trying to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, but it's not immediately clear why this specific calculation is used.

To verify the correctness, we need to check if this formula correctly computes the maximum number of times Bob can win for any possible input. Let's consider some edge cases and examples:

### Example Analysis

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * 1) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - Result: `3 // 3 = 1`
   - This matches the expected output.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 1) = 1 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 5`
   - Result: `5 // 3 = 1`
   - This matches the expected output.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * 1) = 3 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 9`
   - Result: `9 // 3 = 3`
   - This matches the expected output.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 1) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * 1) = 5 + 5 + 3 + 0 = 13`
   - Result: `13 // 3 = 4` (This does not match the expected output of 3)

From the above analysis, we see that the program does not produce the correct output for the last example. This indicates that the formula used in the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
