Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function receives four integers `p_i` (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the count of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence, respectively. The function returns the result for each test case based on these counts.**
