The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list containing the string `'1'`. Additionally, the `i`-th bit of `x` is set (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is true).**
