Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first converting the given integer `x` into a binary representation of length 30. It then modifies this binary representation to ensure that no two consecutive elements are non-zero (i.e., no two consecutive '1's or '-1's). However, there are several issues with the program that make it incorrect:

1. **Binary Representation Construction**: The program constructs a binary representation of `x` by appending '1' or '0' based on the bitwise AND operation with powers of 2. This part is correct for generating a binary string, but it does not handle the requirement to use '-1' and the restriction on consecutive non-zero elements.

2. **Modification of Binary Representation**: The program's logic for modifying the binary string to meet the problem's requirements is flawed. It tries to insert '-1' and '0' in a way that avoids consecutive non-zero elements, but it doesn't always produce a valid result. Specifically, the logic for handling the last element and the overall structure of the loop can lead to incorrect outputs.

3. **Output Handling**: The program prints the length and the modified binary string, but due to the flawed logic in modifying the binary string, the output may not always satisfy the problem's conditions.

4. **Example Mismatch**: The output provided in the example does not match the logic of the given program. For instance, the program's logic would not produce the output `0 -1 0 0 1` for the input `14` as shown in the example.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is a power of 2 or when `x` has a specific pattern that requires the use of '-1'.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
