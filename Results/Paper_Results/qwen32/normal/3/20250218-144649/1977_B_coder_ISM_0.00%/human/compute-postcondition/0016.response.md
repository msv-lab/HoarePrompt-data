The code snippet appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Therefore, the list `s` will now contain an additional `'1'` at the end. The values of the other variables (`t`, `x`, `length`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, with an additional `'1'` appended to it, `length` is 30, `i` is `i + 1`**.
