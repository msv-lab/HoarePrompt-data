Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string '1' or '0' depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, with an additional '0' appended, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or not 0, and `nalla` is `nalla + 1`. `i` is 30.**

In natural language: The list `s` now contains an additional '0' appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
