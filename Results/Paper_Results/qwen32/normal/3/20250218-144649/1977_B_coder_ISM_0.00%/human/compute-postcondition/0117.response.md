Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings where each string is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit (from 0 to 29) of `x` is set or not, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, and `i` is 0. If `flag` is 1, the first string in `s` is '0' and the remaining 29 strings are either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit (from 1 to 29) of `x` is set or not. Otherwise, `flag` is 0 and `flag` is not equal to 1.**
