The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` modifies the list `s` by setting the element at index `i - 1` to `'-1'`. Since the initial state does not specify a particular value for `i`, we will consider the impact in general terms, keeping in mind that `i` is an integer and `s` is a list of 30 strings where each element is initially `'0'`.

Given that `s` is a list of 30 strings, `i` must be within the range 1 to 30 to ensure the index `i - 1` is valid (0 to 29).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `flag` is 0 if `s[29]` is `'0'` or if the else part is taken, otherwise `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is `'1'`, `s` is a list of 30 strings where `s[i-1]` is `'-1'` and all other `s[j]` for `j != i-1` are `'0'`, `length` is at least 2.**

In simpler terms, the element at index `i-1` in the list `s` is now `'-1'`, while all other elements in the list remain `'0'`. The values of `t`, `x`, `nalla`, `flag`, and `length` remain unchanged.
