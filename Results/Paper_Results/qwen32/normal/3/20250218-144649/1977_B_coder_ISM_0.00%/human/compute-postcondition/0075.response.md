Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with either 30 elements where no consecutive elements are `'1'` or 31 elements where the 31st element is `'1'` and no other consecutive elements are `'1'`, except that if `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`, then `s[i - 1]` is now `'-1'` and `s[i]` is now `'0'`. `length` is either 30 or 31, `flag` is either 0 or not 0, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
