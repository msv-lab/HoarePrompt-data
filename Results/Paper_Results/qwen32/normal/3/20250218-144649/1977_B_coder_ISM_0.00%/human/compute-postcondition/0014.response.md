Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing either the string `'1'` or the string `'0'` depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, with an additional `'1'` appended to it if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, or an additional `'0'` appended if the `i`-th bit of `x` is not set, `length` is 30, `i` is `i + 1`.**
