The code snippet assigns the value `30` to the variable `length`. The other variables `t`, `x`, and `s` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is an empty list; `length` is 30**.
