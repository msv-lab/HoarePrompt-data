Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings where `s[i]` is '-1' and each of the other strings is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit (from 0 to 29) of `x` is set or not, `length` is 30, `flag` is 0, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, and `i` is 0. Additionally, `s[i]` is '-1', and `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `s[i]` has been changed to '-1'. All other variables retain their initial values. The condition that `s[i]` was equal to `s[i + 1]` is no longer true since `s[i]` is now '-1'.
