Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is 1, `nalla` is `nalla + 1`, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list of 30 strings, each either `'1'` or `'0'` except the `i`-th element which is now `'-1'`. The `i`-th element of `s` was originally `'1'` and the `(i + 1)`-th element of `s` is still `'1'`. `i` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `flag` has been changed from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their original values and states as described in the initial state.
