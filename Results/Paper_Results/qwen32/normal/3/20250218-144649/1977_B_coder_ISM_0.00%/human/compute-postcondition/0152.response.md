The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` modifies the value of the element at index `i - 1` in the list `s` to be `'-1'`. Given the initial state, `s[i - 1]` was previously `'1'`. After the execution of the code, `s[i - 1]` becomes `'-1'`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of strings where each string is either '1', '0', or '-1', `flag` is either 0 or 1, `nalla` is unchanged, `length` is greater than 1, `s[i]` is '0', and `s[i - 1]` is '-1'.**
