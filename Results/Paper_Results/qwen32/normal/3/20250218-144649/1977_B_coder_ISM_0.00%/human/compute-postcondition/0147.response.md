Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of strings where each string is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 1, `s` has 31 elements and `s[30]` is '1', otherwise `s` has 30 elements. `length` is 31 if `flag` is 1, otherwise `length` is 30. `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `nalla` is unchanged. Additionally, either `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.**
