Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is the concatenated string of all substrings from `operational_list` that, when reversed, have the same length as the original substring, followed by either the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the reverse of `val_in` if `x` is odd, `rev_val` is a list of all reversed substrings from `operational_list` that do not meet the length criteria, `rev_val` is sorted, and `rev_val` must have at least one element, `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is even, or `rev_val[x]` itself if `x` is odd, `x` is `x + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `val_in` is updated to be the integer value of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is even, or `rev_val[x]` itself if `x` is odd. The value of `x` is then incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
