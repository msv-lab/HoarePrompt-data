The code snippet `operational_list = input().split()` takes an input string from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `operational_list`. The other variables (`t`, `y`, `rev_val`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, and `max_power`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input.**
