The code snippet `val_in = int(rev_val[x])` takes the `x`-th element from the `rev_val` list, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `val_in`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (unchanged).
- `y` is 1 (unchanged).
- `list_len` is the first value from the input (unchanged).
- `max_power` is the second value from the input (unchanged).
- `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input (unchanged).
- `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the reversed string `x_rev` has the same length as `x` (unchanged).
- `rev_val` is a sorted list of all reversed strings `x_rev` from `operational_list` where the length of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x` and must have at least one element (unchanged).
- `x` is an even integer (unchanged).

The variable `val_in` is newly introduced and assigned the value of the `x`-th element of `rev_val` converted to an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first value from the input, `max_power` is the second value from the input, `operational_list` is a list of substrings from the input, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the reversed string `x_rev` has the same length as `x`, `rev_val` is a sorted list of all reversed strings `x_rev` from `operational_list` where the length of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x` and must have at least one element, `x` is an even integer, `val_in` is the integer value of the `x`-th element of `rev_val`.**
