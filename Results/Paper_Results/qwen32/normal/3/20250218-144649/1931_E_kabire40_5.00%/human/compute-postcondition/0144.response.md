Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `y` is 2, `list_len` is unchanged, `max_power` is unchanged, `operational_list` is unchanged, `rev_val` is a list of reversed strings of all substrings from `operational_list` that do not maintain the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, and `rev_val` must have at least one element, `x` is 4, `len(rev_val)` must be greater than 4. If `x % 2 == 0`, then `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[4]` and `rev_res` is updated to its previous value concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`. Otherwise, `val_in` is `rev_val[4]` and `rev_res` includes the reversed string of `rev_val[4]`.**
