You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        rev_val = []
        rev_res = ''
        (list_len, max_power) = input().split()
        operational_list = input().split()
        for x in operational_list:
            x_rev = int(x[::-1])
            if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
                rev_res = rev_res + x
            else:
                rev_val.append(x[::-1])
        rev_val.sort()
        for x in range(len(rev_val)):
            if x % 2 == 0:
                val_in = int(rev_val[x])
                rev_res += str(val_in)
            else:
                val_in = rev_val[x]
                rev_res += val_in[::-1]
        if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it performs operations on the list `a` involving reversing integers and sorting. Based on the results of these operations and the value of `m`, it prints either "Sasha" or "Anna".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number.
   - Sasha concatenates two numbers and removes them from the list.
   - The game ends when only one number remains.
   - Sasha wins if the remaining number is at least \(10^m\).

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they make moves that maximize their chances of winning.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program attempts to simulate the game and determine the winner. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Reversing Elements**:
   - The program reverses the digits of all elements in the list and stores them in `rev_val` if the reversed number has a different length than the original.
   - This logic is incorrect because Anna can reverse any element at any point, not all at once.
   - The program concatenates elements in a specific way, which does not simulate the optimal play of Sasha.

2. **Concatenation Strategy**:
   - The program sorts the reversed elements and then alternates between adding and reversing them to form `rev_res`.
   - This strategy does not simulate Sasha's optimal move of concatenating any two numbers.
   - Sasha can concatenate any two numbers in any order, which is not considered in the program.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if the final concatenated number is greater than \(10^m\).
   - However, the strategy used to concatenate numbers is not optimal and does not guarantee the correct winner.

### Correctness:

Given the issues in the logic and implementation, the program does not correctly simulate the game or determine the winner based on optimal play.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
