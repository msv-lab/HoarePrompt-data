Postcondition: **`rev_res` is the concatenation of all substrings from `operational_list` that maintain the same length when reversed, followed by the processed elements from `rev_val` according to the loop's logic. `t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` remain unchanged. The current value of `rev_res` is such that `10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res)` is true.**
