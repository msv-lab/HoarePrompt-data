Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `y` is 2, `list_len` is unchanged, `max_power` is unchanged, `operational_list` is unchanged, `rev_res` is the concatenation of all substrings from `operational_list` that maintain the same length when reversed, followed by either the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the original string at index `x` of `rev_val` if `x` is odd. `rev_val` is a list of reversed strings of all substrings from `operational_list` that do not maintain the same length when reversed, sorted in ascending order, and `rev_val` must have at least one element. `val_in` is an integer representation of the `x`-th element of `rev_val` if `x` is even, or the element at index `x` of `rev_val` if `x` is odd.**
