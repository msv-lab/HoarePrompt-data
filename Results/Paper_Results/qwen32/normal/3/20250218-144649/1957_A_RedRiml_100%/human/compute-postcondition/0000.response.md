The code snippet `w = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `w`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`. The initial state mentions that `t` (number of test cases) is provided as an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Since `w` is assigned the value of `t`, we can update the state accordingly.

Output State: **`w` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ w ≤ 100)**.
