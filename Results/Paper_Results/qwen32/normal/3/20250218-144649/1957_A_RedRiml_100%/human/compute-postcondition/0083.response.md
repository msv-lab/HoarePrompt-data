The code snippet provided updates the `palka` variable by reading a new list of integers from the input. The other variables (`w`, `ln`, `pl`, `d`, and `shapes`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the new input, `pl` is a list of unique integers from the previous `palka` in the order they first appeared, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer from the previous `palka`, and `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**
