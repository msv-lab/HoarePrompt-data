The code snippet provided is `ln = int(input())`. This means that the variable `ln` will be reassigned to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`w`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`, and `shapes`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, and `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**
