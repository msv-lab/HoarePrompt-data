The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements in the list `palka`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next element in `palka`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive.
- `ln` is an input integer.
- `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element.
- `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d[i]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by `1`.
- If `i` was not in `pl` before the if statement, `pl` now contains the current value of `i`.
- `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.

Since `i` is the loop variable, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `palka`. We don't need to modify any other variables as they are not part of the loop head.

Let's denote the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `palka[k]`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `palka[k+1]`.

State: **`w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d[i]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by `1`. If `i` was not in `pl` before the if statement, `pl` now contains the current value of `i`. `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, `i` is the next element in `palka`**.
