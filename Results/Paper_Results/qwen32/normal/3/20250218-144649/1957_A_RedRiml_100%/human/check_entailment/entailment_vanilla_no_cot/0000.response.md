Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it only considers forming polygons with exactly 3 sides (triangles), which is not the requirement of the problem. The problem requires forming regular polygons with any number of equal-sided sides, not just triangles.

To fix the program, we need to consider forming polygons with 3 or more sides. For each unique stick length, we should determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of sticks of that length by the number of sides (ranging from 3 upwards) and taking the maximum possible number of polygons that can be formed.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) is None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
        shapes = 0
        for length, count in d.items():
            # Check polygons with sides from 3 upwards
            for sides in range(3, count + 1):
                if count % sides == 0:
                    shapes += count // sides
                    break  # We only need the maximum number of polygons for this length
        print(shapes)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through possible polygon side lengths starting from 3 and checks if the count of sticks of a certain length can form a polygon with that many sides. It then adds the maximum number of polygons that can be formed to the total count.
