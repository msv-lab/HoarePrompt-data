The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Since `d.get(i)` is not `None`, it means that `i` is already a key in the dictionary `d` with some initial value.

Given this, let's update the state:
- The value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, and `shapes` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary except for the key `i` which now has a value of `d[i] + 1`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, and `d.get(i)` is not `None`.**
