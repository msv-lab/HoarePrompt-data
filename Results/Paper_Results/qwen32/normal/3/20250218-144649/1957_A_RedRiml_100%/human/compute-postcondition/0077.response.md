To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

The code snippet is:
```python
shapes += d[j] // 3
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `w` is between 0 and 99 inclusive.
- `ln` is the input integer.
- `palka` is the list of integers from the input.
- `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements.
- `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer from `palka`.
- `j` is the next element in `pl`.
- `shapes` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it is an integer that has been defined previously.

The code snippet modifies the value of `shapes` by adding the integer division of the count of `j` in `d` by 3.

Let's denote the count of `j` in `d` as `d[j]`. The operation `d[j] // 3` computes the integer division of `d[j]` by 3, which means it divides `d[j]` by 3 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the new value of `shapes` will be the old value of `shapes` plus the result of `d[j] // 3`.

Since the values of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, and `d` remain unchanged, the output state will be:
- `w` is between 0 and 99 inclusive.
- `ln` is the input integer.
- `palka` is the list of integers from the input.
- `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements.
- `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer from `palka`.
- `j` is the next element in `pl`.
- `shapes` is updated to its old value plus `d[j] // 3`.

Output State: **`w` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the list of integers from the input, `pl` is a list of unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary with counts of each unique integer from `palka`, `j` is the next element in `pl`, `shapes` is updated to its old value plus `d[j] // 3`.**
