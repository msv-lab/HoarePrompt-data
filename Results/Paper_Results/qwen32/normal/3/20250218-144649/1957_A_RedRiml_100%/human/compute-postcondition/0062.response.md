The code snippet `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. This means that if `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is now `1`. If `i` was not a key in `d`, it is added with the value `1`. Since `i` is the next element in the list `palka`, and `palka` is a list of integers, `i` is an integer. The other variables (`w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `shapes`) are not affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the dictionary `d` where the key `i` is now mapped to `1`. The value of `shapes` remains the same because `shapes` is calculated based on the values in `d` that are divided by `3` and summed, and this assignment does not change any existing value that could contribute to `shapes` (since `1 // 3` is `0`).

Output State: **`w` must be between 0 and 99 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from new input and must have at least one element, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is `1` (regardless of its previous value), `pl` contains the current value of `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, and `i` is the next element in `palka`.**
