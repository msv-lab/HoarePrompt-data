The code snippet `pl.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `pl` was initially empty, after this operation, `pl` will contain the single element `i`.

The value of `shapes` is dependent on the contents of `pl` and the dictionary `d`. Since `pl` was empty before the operation, `shapes` was 0 (as there were no elements in `pl` to sum). After `i` is appended to `pl`, `shapes` will now consider the value of `d[i] // 3` if `d[i] >= 3`. However, since `i` has just been added to `pl` and the problem does not specify an immediate change in `d[i]` due to this operation, we can assume `shapes` remains 0 unless `d[i]` is modified in a way that affects `shapes` (which is not the case here).

The values of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, and the condition about `d.get(i)` are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`w` is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is the new input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 integer, `pl` is a list containing the single element `i`, `shapes` is 0, `i` is not in `pl` (before the append operation, now it is in `pl`), If `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` is now `{i: 1}`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1 and `d.get(i)` is not `None`.**
