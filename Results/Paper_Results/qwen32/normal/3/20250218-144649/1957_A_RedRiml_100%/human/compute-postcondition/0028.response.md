The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `shapes` to 0. This assignment does not affect any of the previously defined variables `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, or `d`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` must be between 1 and 100 inclusive, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`; `shapes` is 0.**
