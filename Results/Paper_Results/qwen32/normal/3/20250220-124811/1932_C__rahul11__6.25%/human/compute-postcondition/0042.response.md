The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where `res[c]` is `(ans % m) % MOD`, `k` is `k + 1`, `c` is `c + 1`, `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`, `l` is `l + 1`.**
