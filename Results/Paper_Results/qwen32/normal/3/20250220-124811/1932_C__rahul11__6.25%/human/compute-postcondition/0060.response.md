The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the iteration variable for the loop over `arr`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current element from `arr`. For the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `arr`.

Let's break it down:
- The loop iterates over each element in `arr`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current element.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `arr`.

Since the loop variable `i` is updated automatically to the next element in `arr` during each iteration, we do not need to adjust `arr` itself. We just need to ensure that there is a next element in `arr` for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 0, `ans` is `i * i`, `c` is `n`, `l` is `r + 1` (or vice versa), and `r` is `l - 1` (or vice versa), and `i` is the next element in `arr`.**
