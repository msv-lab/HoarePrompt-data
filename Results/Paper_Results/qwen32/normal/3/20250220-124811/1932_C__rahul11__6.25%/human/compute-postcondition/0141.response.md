The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. No other variables are affected by this statement. The output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, the third element is `ans % m % MOD`, the element at index `c` is `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are 0, `k` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `(previous_value_of_ans // arr[r]) % MOD`, `r` is decremented by 1.**
