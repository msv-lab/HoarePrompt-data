Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `s` is a new list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is 0, `ans` is `i * ans`, `c` is `n`, `l` is between 0 and `n-1` depending on the number of 'L' characters, and `r` is between 0 and `n-1` depending on the number of non-'L' characters. `i` is the next element in `arr`.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` is updated to be the product of its previous value and the current element `i` from the list `arr`. All other variables retain their initial values.
