The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `arr`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` must take the next value from `arr`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string
- `res` is a list of `n` zeros
- `ans` is `ans * i`

Since the loop iterates over `arr`, we need to adjust `i` to the next element in `arr`. Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `i` was the `k`-th element of `arr`. For the next iteration, `i` should be the `(k+1)`-th element of `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is `ans * i`, `i` is the next element in `arr`**.

To be more precise, if in the previous iteration `i` was `arr[k]`, then in the next iteration `i` should be `arr[k+1]`. However, without knowing the exact value of `k`, we can only describe the state in terms of `i` being the next element in `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is `ans * i`, `i` is the next element in `arr`**.
