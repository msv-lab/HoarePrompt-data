The code snippet increments the value of `l` by 1. Since no other variables are affected by this operation, we only need to update the value of `l`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the `c`-th element is `ans % m % MOD` and the rest are 0, `k` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD`, `l` is incremented by 1.**
