The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. No other variables are directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `c` is updated to `c + 1`, and all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element, second element, and the element at index `c` are updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is incremented by 1. If `s[k]` was 'L', `ans` is updated to `(ans // arr[l]) % MOD` and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and `r` is decremented by 1, `c` is `c + 1`.**
