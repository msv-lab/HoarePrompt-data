The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `arr`. This operation does not affect the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `res`, `ans`, `c`, `l`, `r`) except for `arr`.

Given that the initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers, this line of code will overwrite the existing `arr` with the new list of integers read from the input. The other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `res` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the result of the division operations modulo `m` and `MOD`, `ans` is the product of the remaining element in `arr` after all other elements have been divided out, modulo `MOD`, `c` is `n`, `l` is `r + 1` (or vice versa), and `r` is `l - 1` (or vice versa)**.
