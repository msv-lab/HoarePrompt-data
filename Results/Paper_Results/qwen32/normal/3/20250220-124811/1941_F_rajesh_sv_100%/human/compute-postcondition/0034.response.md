Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`; `ans` is `max_diff`.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` is set to `max_diff`, which is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list `A`. All other variables remain unchanged as described in the initial state.
