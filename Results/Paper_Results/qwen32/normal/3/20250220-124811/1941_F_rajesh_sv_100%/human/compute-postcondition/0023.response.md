Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `i` is 3. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to the value of `diff` and `next_max_diff` is set to the previous value of `max_diff`. Otherwise, if `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff` and greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to the value of `diff`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.**
