Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`, `i` is 4, `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`, `max_diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`.**

In this output state, the value of `max_diff` has been updated to be equal to `diff`, which is `A[4] - A[3]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
