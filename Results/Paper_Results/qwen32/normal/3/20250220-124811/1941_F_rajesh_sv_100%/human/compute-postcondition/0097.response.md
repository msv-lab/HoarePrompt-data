Postcondition: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`; `f` is the next value in `F`; `l` is the smallest index in `D` such that `D[l] > left - f`; `h` is the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `l < h`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. Additionally, `mid_sum - left` is greater than or equal to `right - mid_next_sum`.**
