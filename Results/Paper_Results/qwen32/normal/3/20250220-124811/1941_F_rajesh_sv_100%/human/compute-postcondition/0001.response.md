The only variable in the loop head is `testcases`, which is used in the `range(testcases)` function. The loop will execute if `testcases` is greater than 0.

Given that `testcases` holds the return value of `func_3()`, we need to ensure that `func_3()` returns a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute. However, since we can only adjust the state of `testcases` and not the function `func_3()`, we need to directly set `testcases` to a value greater than 0.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0**
