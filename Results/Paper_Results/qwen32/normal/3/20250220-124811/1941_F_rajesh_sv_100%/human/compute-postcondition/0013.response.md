Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`; `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff`. The current value of `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`; `next_max_diff` is equal to `diff`.**

This means that the value of `next_max_diff` has been updated to be equal to `diff`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
