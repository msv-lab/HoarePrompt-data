n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, m and k are integers such that 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5, A is a list of n integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9 and A is sorted in strictly ascending order, D is a sorted list of unique integers where 1 <= D[i] <= 10^9, and F is a list of k integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9.
