t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in the list test_cases is a tuple containing four elements: (n, m, k, details), where n, m, and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, and 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. details is a tuple containing three lists: a, d, and f. a is a list of integers of length n such that 1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9 and a is strictly increasing. d is a list of integers of length m such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^9. f is a list of integers of length k such that 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
