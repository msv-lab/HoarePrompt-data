Functionality: **The function takes integers `n`, `m`, `k`, a strictly ascending sorted list `A` of `n` integers, a sorted list `D` of `m` unique integers, and a list `F` of `k` integers. It calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A` and the second maximum difference. For each value in `F`, it finds the optimal position in `D` to minimize a specific expression involving the elements of `A` and `D`, adjusted by the value from `F`. Finally, it prints the maximum value between the second maximum difference and the minimum value of the calculated expression for all values in `F`.**
