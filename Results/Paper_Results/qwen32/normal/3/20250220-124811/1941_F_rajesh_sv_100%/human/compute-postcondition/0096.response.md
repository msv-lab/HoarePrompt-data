The code snippet `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`; `f` is the next value in `F`; `l` is `mid + 1`; `h` is the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `l < h`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; the current value of `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`.**
