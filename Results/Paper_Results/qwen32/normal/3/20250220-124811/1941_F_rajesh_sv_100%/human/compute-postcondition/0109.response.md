Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs; `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]`; `f` is the next value in `F`; `h` is adjusted based on the condition: if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` becomes `mid + 1`; otherwise, `h` becomes `mid`; `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `l` is now `mid + 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `l` has been updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
