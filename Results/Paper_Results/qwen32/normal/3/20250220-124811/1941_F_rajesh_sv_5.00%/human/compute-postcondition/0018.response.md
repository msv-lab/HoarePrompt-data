The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `index`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `index` will be set to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is -inf, `k` is -inf, `A` is initialized, `D` is -inf, `F` is -inf, `max_diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `next_max_diff` is -inf, `index` is 2, `i` is 2, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`**
