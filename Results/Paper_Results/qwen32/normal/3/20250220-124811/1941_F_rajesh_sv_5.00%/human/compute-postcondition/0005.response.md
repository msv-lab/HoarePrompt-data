In the given for loop, the loop variable is `_` and it iterates over the range of `testcases`. The loop variable `_` is not actually used within the loop body, so we only need to adjust the `testcases` variable for the loop to execute one more time.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 1 and must be greater than 0. The function `func_6()` has been executed.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `testcases` must be decremented by 1, as the loop decrements `testcases` by 1 with each iteration (by virtue of the range function).

State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 2 and must be greater than 0. The function `func_6()` has been executed.**
