To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement, we need to evaluate the values of `ans` and `next_max_diff` based on the provided initial state.

1. **max_diff**: This is explicitly given as 2.
2. **next_max_diff**: This is described as the second largest difference between consecutive elements in the list `A`. Let's calculate the differences between consecutive elements in `A`:
   - Difference between 3 and 1: 3 - 1 = 2
   - Difference between 5 and 3: 5 - 3 = 2
   - Difference between 7 and 5: 7 - 5 = 2

   All differences are 2, so there is no second largest difference. However, based on the problem description, we can infer that `next_max_diff` is intended to be the second largest unique difference. Since all differences are the same, we can reasonably consider `next_max_diff` to be 2 (the same as `max_diff`).

3. **ans**: This is explicitly given as 2.

Now, we need to evaluate `max(ans, next_max_diff)`:
- `ans` is 2.
- `next_max_diff` is 2.

The maximum of 2 and 2 is 2.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output 2.

Output: **2**
