Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Monocarp wants to invite friends to a party such that at least 2 of them attend. A friend `i` will only attend if both `i` and their best friend `p_i` receive invitations.

2. **Constraints**:
   - `p_i` are distinct and `p_i != i` for all `i`.
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends attend.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - If there is a triplet `i`, `p_i`, `p_(p_i)` such that `p_(p_(p_i)) = i`, then sending invitations to `i` and `p_i` would ensure that both `i` and `p_i` attend the party.
   - If no such triplet exists, then we need to invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 attend.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the given program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of friends) and the list `p` of best friends.

2. **Handling Special Case**:
   - If `n == 2`, the program directly prints `2` because both friends must be invited to ensure both attend.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program iterates through the list of friends to check if there exists a triplet `i`, `p_i`, `p_(p_i)` such that `p_(p_(p_i)) = i`.
   - If such a triplet is found, it prints `2` and exits the function.
   - If no such triplet is found after checking all friends, it prints `3`.

### Correctness Verification

- **Special Case (n == 2)**:
  - This is correctly handled by the program. If `n == 2`, both friends must be invited.

- **General Case**:
  - The program correctly identifies if there exists a triplet `i`, `p_i`, `p_(p_i)` such that `p_(p_(p_i)) = i` and prints `2` if such a triplet is found.
  - If no such triplet exists, it correctly prints `3` because in this scenario, inviting 2 friends would not be sufficient to ensure that at least 2 friends attend.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party based on the given constraints and observations.

**Correctness: True**
