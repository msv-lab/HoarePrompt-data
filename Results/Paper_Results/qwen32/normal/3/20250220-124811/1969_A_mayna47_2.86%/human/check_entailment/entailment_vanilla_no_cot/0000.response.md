Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send in all cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that if there is a cycle of length 3 (i.e., `v[v[v[i]]] == i`), then only 2 invitations are needed. This assumption is not always correct.

For example, consider the following test case:

```
4
6
2 3 4 5 6 1
```

In this case, no cycle of length 3 exists, and Monocarp needs to send at least 3 invitations to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. However, the program would incorrectly print `2` for this test case.

The logic for determining the minimum number of invitations should be more robust. One approach is to use graph theory to find the minimum number of nodes to cover all edges in the graph, which represents the friendships. This can be done using a greedy algorithm or by finding the minimum vertex cover in the graph.
