The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the for loop statement, `i` ranges from 1 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `i` to the next value it should take in the sequence.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented to a value that is one more than it was in the previous iteration. If `i` is still within the range [1, n], the loop will execute again. Otherwise, the loop will terminate.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to ensure `i` is the next integer in the sequence from 1 to `n`.

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` decremented back by 1 (to its value at the end of the last iteration) and then incremented again to the next value in the sequence.

However, since we are only adjusting the state for the start of the next iteration, and given that `i` is already `i + 1` at the end of the last iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should simply have `i` set to its next value in the sequence, which is `i + 1` (if it is still within the range).

Therefore, if `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop will execute again with `i` incremented by 1. If `i` is greater than `n`, the loop will terminate.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next value in the sequence, which is `i + 1` (if it is still within the range).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= n, `p_i` != i; `v` is a list where the first element is 0 and the next n elements are integers read from the input.
