The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state provides detailed descriptions of several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are referenced in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the value specified in the `print` statement itself.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, including:
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `n`: An integer between 3 and 50.
   - `p`: A list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`.
   - `v`: A list starting with 0, followed by `n` integers read from the input.
   - A condition that `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i` for the current `i`.
   - `i`: An integer that increments by 1 if `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. The `print` statement is:
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

3. Since the `print` statement directly outputs the integer `2`, the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `p`, `v`, and `i` do not influence the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
