To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the behavior of the loop step by step.

### Initial Setup
- `n` is 10.
- `a` is `[1, 5, 9]`.
- `tmp` is `[2, 2, 3]`. This list is derived from the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the difference between the first and last element of `a` adjusted by `n`.

### Loop Execution
The loop iterates over each element `i` in `tmp`. The loop body checks if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`:
- If true, `ans` is incremented by `i` and `y` is decremented by `i - 1`.
- If false, the loop breaks.

### Iteration Details
1. **First Iteration (`i = 2`)**:
   - If `y >= 1`, `ans` becomes `ans + 2` and `y` becomes `y - 1`.
   
2. **Second Iteration (`i = 2`)**:
   - If `y >= 1`, `ans` becomes `ans + 2` and `y` becomes `y - 1`.
   
3. **Third Iteration (`i = 3`)**:
   - If `y >= 2`, `ans` becomes `ans + 3` and `y` becomes `y - 2`.

### Output States After Each Iteration
- **After 1st Iteration**: `y` must be at least 1 to proceed, `ans` increases by 2, and `y` decreases by 1.
- **After 2nd Iteration**: `y` must still be at least 1 to proceed, `ans` increases by 2, and `y` decreases by 1.
- **After 3rd Iteration**: `y` must be at least 2 to proceed, `ans` increases by 3, and `y` decreases by 2.

### Final Calculation
- The loop will continue as long as `y` is sufficient to meet the condition `y >= i - 1` for each `i` in `tmp`.
- If `y` is initially at least 4 (to cover all three iterations), the final `ans` will be incremented by `2 + 2 + 3 = 7`, and `y` will be decreased by `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.

### Final Output State
- `ans` will be the initial value plus 7.
- `y` will be the initial value minus 4.

### Conclusion
Assuming `y` is initially at least 4 (to allow all iterations to run), the final output state will be:

Output State: **ans is the initial value plus 7, and y is the initial value minus 4.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, the value of `ans` will be increased by 7, and the value of `y` will be decreased by 4, assuming `y` was initially sufficient to allow all iterations to complete.
