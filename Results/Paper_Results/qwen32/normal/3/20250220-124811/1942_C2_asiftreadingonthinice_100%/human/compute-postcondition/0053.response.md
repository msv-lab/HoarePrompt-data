To determine what will be printed, we need to break down the given information and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `ans` is calculated as 2 times the initial value plus 3.
- `y` is calculated as the initial value minus 4.
- `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we will treat it as a variable whose value is unknown but will be used in the print statement.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(min(ans, n - 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Calculate `ans`**:
   - `ans` is defined as `2 * initial_value + 3`.
   - Let's denote the initial value as `x`. Therefore, `ans = 2x + 3`.

2. **Calculate `y`**:
   - `y` is defined as `initial_value - 4`.
   - Using the same variable `x`, `y = x - 4`.

3. **Evaluate the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement uses the `min` function to find the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2`.
   - `ans` is `2x + 3`.
   - `n - 2` is simply `n - 2`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the minimum value between `2x + 3` and `n - 2`.

Output: **min(2 * initial_value + 3, n - 2) (where initial_value is the initial value and n is an unknown variable)**
