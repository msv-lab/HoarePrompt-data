To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the `ans` and `y` variables evolve based on the elements in `tmp`.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over each element `i` in `tmp`. For each iteration:
- If `y >= i - 1`, it adds `i` to `ans` and subtracts `i - 1` from `y`.
- If `y < i - 1`, the loop breaks.

### Key Points from the Given Information
1. **Initial State**:
   - `ans` is initialized based on the initial conditions provided.
   - `tmp` contains sorted values `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` where the difference is even and not 2.
   - If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, it is also included in `tmp`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop executes as long as `y >= i - 1` for each `i` in `tmp`.

### Output State after All Iterations

Let's assume that `tmp` contains `k` elements, and we iterate through all `k` elements without breaking the loop. This means for each element `i` in `tmp`, `y` is always greater than or equal to `i - 1`.

For each element `i` in `tmp`:
- `ans` is incremented by `i`.
- `y` is decremented by `i - 1`.

If the loop runs through all `k` elements, the final state of `ans` and `y` can be described as follows:

- **`ans`**: The initial value of `ans` plus the sum of all elements in `tmp`.
- **`y`**: The initial value of `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp`.

### Final Output State
Let's denote:
- `sum_tmp` as the sum of all elements in `tmp`.
- `sum_tmp_minus_1` as the sum of all elements in `tmp` minus 1 for each element.

Thus, the final `ans` is `initial_ans + sum_tmp`, and the final `y` is `initial_y - sum_tmp_minus_1`.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp`. `y` is the initial `y` minus the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp`.**

In simpler terms:
- `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `tmp`.
- `y` is decreased by the sum of `(i - 1)` for all `i` in `tmp`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
