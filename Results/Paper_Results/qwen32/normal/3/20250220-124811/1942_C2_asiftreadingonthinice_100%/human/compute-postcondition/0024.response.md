Postcondition: **`tt` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `ii` is the loop variable and is initialized to 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0`, `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` added to its previous value if it existed, otherwise it contains `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `a[i] - a[i - 1] != 2`. If `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0`, `tmp` initially contains `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.**
