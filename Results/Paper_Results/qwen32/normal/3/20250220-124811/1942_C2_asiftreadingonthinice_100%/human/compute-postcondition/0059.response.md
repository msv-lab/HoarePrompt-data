The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `tmp`. None of the other variables (`ans`, `y`, `ii`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, `a`) are modified by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y` is the third input integer, `ii` is 4, `tt` must be greater than 4, `n` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `tmp` is an empty list.**
