The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `tt`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `ii`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tt` is any value, `t` is any value, `n` is 10, `x` is any value, `ii` is any value, `a` is `[1, 5, 9]`, `tmp` is `[2, 2, 3]`, and `i` is 2.**
