Let's break down the given Python code snippet and determine what will be printed based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- **Input Structure**:
  - The program starts by reading an integer `t`, which indicates the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads four integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`, representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.

- **Code Analysis**:
  - The code reads `t` using `int(input())`.
  - For each of the `t` test cases, it reads the four integers (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`) using `map(int, input().split())`.
  - It then processes these integers using a list comprehension combined with the `enumerate` function to iterate over the sequence of numbers.

### Detailed Breakdown of the Code:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - For each test case, the program reads four integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`.
   - These integers are mapped to a sequence of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) based on their respective counts.

2. **Processing the Sequence**:
   - For each number `x` in the sequence (where `i` is the index of the number in the sequence), the code calculates a value using the formula `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)`.
   - This formula is applied to each number in the sequence:
     - For `x = 1`, `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (i < 3)` simplifies to `0 + 1 * (i < 3)`, which is `1` if `i < 3` and `0` otherwise.
     - For `x = 2`, `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (i < 3)` simplifies to `3 + 0`, which is `3`.
     - For `x = 3`, `3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (i < 3)` simplifies to `3 + 1 * (i < 3)`, which is `4` if `i < 3` and `3` otherwise.
     - For `x = 4`, `3 * (4 // 2) + 4 % 2 * (i < 3)` simplifies to `6 + 0`, which is `6`.

3. **Summing and Dividing**:
   - The calculated values for each number in the sequence are summed up.
   - The sum is then divided by 3 using integer division `// 3`.

4. **Output**:
   - The result of the above calculation is printed for each test case, with each result separated by a newline.

### Final Output:
Given the input structure and the processing logic, the output of the program will be a series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for each test case.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `t = 1` and the input for the single test case is `p1 = 2`, `p2 = 1`, `p3 = 1`, `p4 = 0`.
- The sequence would be `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.
- The calculations would be:
  - For `1` (index 0): `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3) = 1`
  - For `1` (index 1): `3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (1 < 3) = 1`
  - For `2` (index 2): `3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (2 < 3) = 3`
  - For `3` (index 3): `3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (3 < 3) = 3`
- The sum of these values is `1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 8`.
- Dividing by 3 using integer division gives `8 // 3 = 2`.

### Final Output Format:
Output: **result for each test case, separated by newlines**

### General Output:
Given the input format and the processing logic, the output will be a series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for each test case.

Output: **result for each test case, separated by newlines** (where each result is the integer division by 3 of the sum of the calculated values for each number in the sequence for that test case)
