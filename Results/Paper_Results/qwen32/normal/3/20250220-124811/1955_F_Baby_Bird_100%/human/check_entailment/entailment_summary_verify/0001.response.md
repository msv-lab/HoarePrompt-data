### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Analysis

The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

The bitwise XOR of a set of numbers is zero if, for each bit position, there is an even number of numbers contributing a 1 to that bit position. Here’s how the numbers contribute to the XOR:
- 1 contributes 1 to the least significant bit (LSB).
- 2 contributes 1 to the second least significant bit (2nd LSB).
- 3 contributes 1 to both the LSB and the 2nd LSB.
- 4 contributes 1 to the third least significant bit (3rd LSB).

To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers such that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as many times as possible.

#### Solution Analysis

The provided solution uses a mathematical approach to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Count Contributions to Each Bit Position:**
   - Count how many numbers contribute a 1 to each bit position.
   - For numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, the contributions are as follows:
     - 1 contributes to the LSB.
     - 2 contributes to the 2nd LSB.
     - 3 contributes to both the LSB and the 2nd LSB.
     - 4 contributes to the 3rd LSB.

2. **Calculate the Maximum Number of Times Bob Can Win:**
   - For each bit position, calculate how many times we can remove pairs of numbers (which keeps the XOR even) plus an additional number if the count is odd and the bit position is less than 3 (since 4 does not contribute to the first two bits).
   - The formula used in the solution is:
     \[
     \text{sum}((3 \times (\text{count} // 2) + \text{count} \% 2 \times (\text{bit position} < 3)) \text{ for each bit position}) // 3
     \]
   - This formula ensures that we count the maximum number of times we can achieve an even count for each bit position, which corresponds to Bob winning.

#### Example Verification

Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

1. **Test Case:** `1 1 1 0`
   - Numbers: 1, 2, 3
   - XOR is non-zero initially.
   - Eve can remove one of the numbers to make the XOR zero.
   - Maximum times Bob can win: 1

2. **Test Case:** `1 0 1 2`
   - Numbers: 1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 4
   - XOR is non-zero initially.
   - Eve can remove one 1 and one 3 to make the XOR zero.
   - Maximum times Bob can win: 1

3. **Test Case:** `2 2 2 0`
   - Numbers: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3
   - XOR is zero initially.
   - Eve can remove pairs to keep the XOR zero.
   - Maximum times Bob can win: 3

4. **Test Case:** `3 3 2 0`
   - Numbers: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3
   - XOR is non-zero initially.
   - Eve can remove numbers to make the XOR zero.
   - Maximum times Bob can win: 3

5. **Test Case:** `0 9 9 9`
   - Numbers: 2, 2, ..., 2, 3, 3, ..., 3, 4, 4, ..., 4 (9 times each)
   - XOR is zero initially.
   - Eve can remove pairs to keep the XOR zero.
   - Maximum times Bob can win: 12

The solution correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The formula used in the solution is accurate and the program's output matches the expected results for the given examples.
