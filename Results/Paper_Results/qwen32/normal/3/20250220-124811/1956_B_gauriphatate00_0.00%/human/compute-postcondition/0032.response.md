Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times. The function returns a list indicating the distribution of cards to two players such that each player receives `n` cards and the sum of the cards each player receives is as close as possible.**
