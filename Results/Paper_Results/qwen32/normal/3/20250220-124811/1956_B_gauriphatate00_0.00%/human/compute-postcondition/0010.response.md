The value of `idx` is incremented by `n`. Since `idx` was initially 2, the new value of `idx` will be `2 + n`. The values of `n`, `a`, `data`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2 + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**
