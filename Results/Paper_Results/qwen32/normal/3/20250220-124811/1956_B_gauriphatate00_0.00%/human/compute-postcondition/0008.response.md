The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `idx` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.
