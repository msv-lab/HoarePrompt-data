### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can score, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. Each player receives `n` cards, and the game involves placing cards on a table, scoring points when a card's number is already on the table, and playing optimally.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To compute the maximum number of points you can score given your hand of cards.
- **Logic**: It counts the number of integers in your hand that appear exactly twice (since these can potentially score points if Nene doesn't place the same card before you). It then returns the minimum of this count and `n // 2` (since you can only make `n` moves, and half of these could potentially score points if Nene doesn't interfere optimally).
- **Output**: The function correctly computes the maximum points you can score based on the described logic.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To handle multiple test cases by reading input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and printing the results.
- **Logic**: It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of `n` integers `a`. It then calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result.
- **Output**: The function correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the expected results.

### Conclusion:
Both `func_1` and `func_2` work together to solve the problem as described. `func_1` correctly computes the maximum points you can score for a given hand, and `func_2` handles the input/output for multiple test cases.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
