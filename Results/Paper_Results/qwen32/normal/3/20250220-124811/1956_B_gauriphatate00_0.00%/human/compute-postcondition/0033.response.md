Functionality: **The function reads input data representing multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of cards `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it computes and prints a result indicating the distribution of cards to two players such that each player receives `n` cards and the sum of the cards each player receives is as close as possible.**
