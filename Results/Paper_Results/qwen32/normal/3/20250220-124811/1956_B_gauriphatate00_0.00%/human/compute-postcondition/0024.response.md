To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to generalize the pattern observed from the first three iterations.

From the first three iterations, we observe:
- `n` is determined by `data[idx]` at the start of each iteration.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`.
- `idx` is incremented by `n + 1` after each iteration to point to the start of the next `n`.
- `results` accumulates the results of `func_1(n, a)` after each iteration.

After `t` iterations, the loop will have processed `t` sets of `n` integers each. The final `idx` will be the starting index for the next set of data, which would be `1 + Σ(n_i) for i in range(t)`, where `n_i` is the `n` value for the `i-th` iteration.

The `results` list will contain `t` elements, each the result of `func_1(n, a)` for the respective iteration.

Thus, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx]` from the last iteration, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]` from the last iteration, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `idx` is `1 + Σ(n_i) for i in range(t)`, `t` is the total number of iterations, and `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)` for each of the `t` iterations.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `idx` will point just beyond the last processed `n` integers, and `results` will contain the output of `func_1` for each set of `n` integers processed.
