The only variable in the loop head is `result`, which is an element of the list `results`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next element in the list `results`.

Given that `results` is a list containing at least one element at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still have elements left to iterate over. Since the loop iterates over each element in `results`, the next state should reflect the next element in the list.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify the length of `results` or the current position in the list, we can assume that there is at least one more element in the list for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`results` is a list containing at least two elements, `result` is the second element in the list**
