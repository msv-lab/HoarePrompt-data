The code snippet `n = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `n` to the integer value of the string at the index `idx` in the list `data`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `idx` is `3 + n + n`, which simplifies to `3 + 2 * n`, the value of `n` will be updated based on the string at this index in the list `data`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2 * n]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace; `idx` is `3 + 2 * n`; `t` must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the previous result of `func_1(n, a)` and the new result of `func_1(n, a)`**.
