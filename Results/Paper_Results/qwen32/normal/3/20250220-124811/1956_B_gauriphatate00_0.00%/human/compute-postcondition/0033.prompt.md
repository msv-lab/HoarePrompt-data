You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, and a is a list of n integers where each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
        
    #State: `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]` from the last iteration, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]` from the last iteration, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `idx` is `1 + Σ(n_i) for i in range(t)`, `t` is the total number of iterations, and `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)` for each of the `t` iterations.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: results is a list containing all elements corresponding to the number of iterations, and `result` is each element in the list sequentially.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times. The function returns a list indicating the distribution of cards to two players such that each player receives `n` cards and the sum of the cards each player receives is as close as possible.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
