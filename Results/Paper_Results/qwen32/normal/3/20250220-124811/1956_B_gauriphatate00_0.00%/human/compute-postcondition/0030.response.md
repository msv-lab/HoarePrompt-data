To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

Initial State:
- `results` is a list containing at least three elements.
- `result` is the third element in the list `results`.

The print statement:
```python
print(result)
```

Based on the precondition, `result` is explicitly defined as the third element of the list `results`. Since the list `results` contains at least three elements, `result` will be the value of the element at index 2 (since list indices are zero-based).

However, the specific value of the third element in the list `results` is not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the value of `result` in terms of its position in the list.

Output: **result (where result is the third element of the list `results`)**
