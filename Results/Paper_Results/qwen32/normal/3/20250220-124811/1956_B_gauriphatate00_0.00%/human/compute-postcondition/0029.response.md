The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least two elements, and `result` is the second element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 3 elements, and `result` will be the third element in the list.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least three elements, `result` is the third element in the list**
