Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2 + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `idx` is `3 + n`, `t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)`**

Natural language: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, so `idx` now equals `3 + n`. All other variables retain their previous values.
