The initial state describes that `t` remains unchanged, and `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting the input string `s`. However, the `print('YES')` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, or `a`. It simply prints the string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not involve any of the variables mentioned.

Output: **YES**
