To determine the new value of `z` after the execution of the code snippet, we start with the given initial state and apply the operation step by step.

Initial State: `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between `k` and 100 (inclusive) and not equal to `k - 1`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `z` is `k - 2`, `i` is 0.

The operation to be performed is:
```
z += z // (k - 1) + 1
```

First, calculate `z // (k - 1)`. Given that `z = k - 2`, we substitute `z` in the expression:
```
z // (k - 1) = (k - 2) // (k - 1)
```

The result of the integer division `(k - 2) // (k - 1)` is `0` for all values of `k` between 2 and 30 because `k - 2` is always less than `k - 1`.

Next, add `1` to the result of the integer division:
```
z // (k - 1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
```

Now, add this result back to `z`:
```
z += 1
```

Therefore, the new value of `z` is:
```
z = (k - 2) + 1 = k - 1
```

The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between `k` and 100 (inclusive) and not equal to `k - 1`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `z` is `k - 1`, `i` is 0.**
