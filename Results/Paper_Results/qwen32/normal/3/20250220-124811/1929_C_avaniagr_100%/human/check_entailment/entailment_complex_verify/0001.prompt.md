You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

    #State: The output state after all iterations is determined by the last test case processed. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will be those of the last test case, and the output will be "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions of that test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines whether a certain condition is met based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`, and prints "YES" if the condition is satisfied or "NO" otherwise. The final state of the program is the output of "YES" or "NO" for each test case, with the output for the last test case being the last printed result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and see if it aligns with the problem description and the provided examples.

### Problem Analysis

The problem boils down to determining whether Sasha can guarantee that he can achieve any number of coins `n` given the rules of the casino and his initial amount of coins `a`.

1. **Winning and Losing Rules**:
    - If Sasha wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
    - If Sasha loses, his coins decrease by `y`.
    - He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.

2. **Goal**:
    - Determine if Sasha can always reach any number of coins `n` regardless of the outcome of the bets (as long as he does not lose more than `x` times in a row).

### Strategy Analysis

The key to solving this problem is to understand the relationship between `k`, `x`, and `a`:

1. **If `x < k - 1`**:
    - Sasha can only afford to lose `x` times in a row, which is less than the number of times he needs to win to recover from a single loss (which requires `k - 1` wins to recover the lost coins).
    - The minimum amount of coins needed to guarantee that Sasha can recover from `x` consecutive losses is `x + 1` (since he can afford to lose `x` times and still have at least 1 coin to bet).

2. **If `x == k - 1`**:
    - Sasha can afford to lose `x` times in a row, which is exactly the number of times he needs to win to recover from a single loss.
    - The minimum amount of coins needed to guarantee that Sasha can recover from `x` consecutive losses is `x + 2` (since he can afford to lose `x` times and still have at least 2 coins to bet).

3. **If `x > k - 1`**:
    - Sasha can afford to lose more times than he needs to win to recover from a single loss.
    - The minimum amount of coins needed is more complex to calculate but can be approximated by a loop that simulates the process of recovering from consecutive losses.

### Program Analysis

The given program follows the above logic:

1. **For `x < k - 1`**:
    - It checks if `a >= x + 1` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".

2. **For `x == k - 1`**:
    - It checks if `a >= x + 2` and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO".

3. **For `x > k - 1`**:
    - It uses a loop to calculate the minimum amount of coins needed to recover from `x` consecutive losses and checks if `a` is greater than or equal to this amount.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the rules of the casino and his initial amount of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.
