The given code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

The initial state describes that `t` remains unchanged, and `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting the input string `s`. However, these variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `s`) are not used in the provided print statement. The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since there are no variables or conditions affecting the output of this print statement, the output will be exactly the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
