Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers derived from the split string `s` with constraints `2 ≤ k ≤ 30`, `1 ≤ x ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9`. The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, `a` remains greater than or equal to `x + 1`; otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` equals `k - 1`, `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 2` or less than `x + 2`.**
