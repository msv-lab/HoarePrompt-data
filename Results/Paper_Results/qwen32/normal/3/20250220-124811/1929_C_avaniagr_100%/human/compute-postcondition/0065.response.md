The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the expression `x - k + 3`. Since the loop iterates over `i` in the range of `x - k + 3`, only `i` can be adjusted for the next iteration. The values of `x`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop head.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken the value it had during that iteration. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1.

Given:
- `x` is 5
- `k` is 3
- `x - k + 3` evaluates to `5 - 3 + 3` which is `5`

This means `i` ranges from `0` to `4` (inclusive). If `i` was `3` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `4` at the start of the next iteration for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`s` is the next input string from the file, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is 3, `x` is 5, `a` is an integer, `z` is 2, `i` is 4**
