To determine the new value of `z` after the code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is executed, we start by analyzing the current state of `z` and how it is updated by the given code.

Initial State: 
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `k` and `x` are integers obtained by splitting the input string `s` such that `x > k - 3`.
- `a` is an integer obtained by splitting the input string `s`.
- `z` is updated to \(\left((k - 2) + \left(\frac{k - 2}{k - 1}\right) + 1\right) + \left(\frac{(k - 2) + \left(\frac{k - 2}{k - 1}\right) + 1}{k - 1}\right) + 1\).
- `i` is incremented by 1.

The code snippet modifies `z` by adding to it the result of `z // (k - 1) + 1`.

Let's denote the initial value of `z` as `z_initial`. The new value of `z` after executing the code will be `z_initial + z_initial // (k - 1) + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `k` and `x` are integers obtained by splitting the input string `s` such that `x > k - 3`, `a` is an integer obtained by splitting the input string `s`, `z` is updated to \(\left((k - 2) + \left(\frac{k - 2}{k - 1}\right) + 1\right) + \left(\frac{(k - 2) + \left(\frac{k - 2}{k - 1}\right) + 1}{k - 1}\right) + 1 + \left(\left((k - 2) + \left(\frac{k - 2}{k - 1}\right) + 1\right) + \left(\frac{(k - 2) + \left(\frac{k - 2}{k - 1}\right) + 1}{k - 1}\right) + 1\right) // (k - 1) + 1\), `i` is incremented by 1.**
