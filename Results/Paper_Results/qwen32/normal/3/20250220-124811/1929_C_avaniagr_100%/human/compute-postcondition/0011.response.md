The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, or any other variables defined in the initial state. The initial state provides specific constraints and relationships between `k`, `x`, and `a`, but these do not affect the output of the `print` statement, which is a static string.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes the values and constraints of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
2. The relationship `x = k - 1` and the condition `a >= x + 2` are given, but these do not influence the `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
