The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each test case, it determines whether a certain condition is met based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`, and prints "YES" if the condition is satisfied or "NO" otherwise. The final state of the program is the output of "YES" or "NO" for each test case, with the output for the last test case being the last printed result.
