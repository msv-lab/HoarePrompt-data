The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the range specified by `x - k + 3`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Let's calculate the range: `x - k + 3`. Given that `x` is between `k` and 100 (inclusive) and not equal to `k - 1`, and `k` is between 2 and 30, the range will be between `4` and `101` (since the minimum value of `x - k + 3` is `1 - 2 + 3 = 2` which is adjusted to `4` because `x` cannot be `k-1`, and the maximum value is `100 - 2 + 3 = 101`).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be 2.

State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between `k` and 100 (inclusive) and not equal to `k - 1`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `z` is `k + 1`, `i` is 2**
