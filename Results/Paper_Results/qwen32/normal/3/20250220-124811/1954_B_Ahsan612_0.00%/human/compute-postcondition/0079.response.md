Postcondition: **`i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is 1 if the last sequence of consecutive elements in `ar` has only one element, or it is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements if they are more than one, `minn` is either `inf` or a finite value that is less than or equal to the current value of `same`, and `num` is the last unique number encountered in the list.**
