The value of `num` is assigned the value of the element at index `i` in the list `ar`. Since `i` is incremented by 2, `num` will be the element at the new index `i` in the list `ar`. The length of `ar` is still greater than `i` as per the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 2, `ar` has a length greater than `i`, `num` is `ar[i]`**.
