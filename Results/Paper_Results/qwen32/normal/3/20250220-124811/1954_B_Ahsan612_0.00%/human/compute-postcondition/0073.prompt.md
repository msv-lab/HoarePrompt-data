Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will continue until `i` is equal to the length of `ar`. `same` will hold the count of consecutive elements equal to `num` at the end of the last sequence of equal elements and is now 1. `minn` will hold the minimum count of consecutive equal elements encountered during the entire iteration, updated to be the minimum between its current value and `same` if `minn` was not initially `inf`. `num` will hold the last unique number encountered in the list and is now `ar[0]`. If `minn` was initially `inf`, it remains `inf`; otherwise, it is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements. `i` is now 1. `n` is an input integer. `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `minn` is `inf`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(ar):
    if ar[i] == num:
        same += 1
    else:
        i += 1
        num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        same = 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2 or 3, `ar` has a length greater than 1, `same` is 1 if `ar[i]` did not equal `num` initially, otherwise `same` is incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` did not equal `num`, `num` is set to `ar[2]` and `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the previous value of `same`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is incremented by 1; `ar` has a length greater than 1; If `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, `same` is incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` was not equal to `num`, `same` is reset to 1, `num` is set to `ar[i]`, and `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the current value of `same`. If `ar[i]` was equal to `num` and `ar[i]` did not equal `num` initially, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the previous value of `same`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is incremented by 1, `ar` has a length greater than `i`, `same` is incremented by 1 if `ar[i]` equals `num`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 2, `num` is set to `ar[i]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
