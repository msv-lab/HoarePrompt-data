The code snippet `same += 1` increments the value of the variable `same` by 1. The other variables (`ar`, `i`, `minn`, `num`, `n`, and `ar[i]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `same` is 2, `minn` is `inf`, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `n` is an input integer, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**
