The variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the condition `i < len(ar)` must be satisfied.

From the provided state:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `ar` has a length greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(ar)`.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was `x` at the start of the previous iteration, it is now `x + 1`.
- `ar` has a length greater than 1, so `len(ar) > 1`.

To make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need `x + 1 < len(ar)`. This implies that `i` (which is now `x + 1`) must be less than `len(ar)`. Therefore, `len(ar)` must be at least `i + 1`.

Since we know `i` is incremented by 1 and `ar` has a length greater than 1, we need to adjust `i` and `len(ar)` accordingly to ensure that `i < len(ar)` holds true.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `ar` has a length greater than `i`**
