The given code snippet only initializes `minn` to `inf`. This does not affect the other variables or the loop conditions. Therefore, the values of `same`, `num`, `i`, `n`, and `ar` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The loop will continue until `i` is equal to the length of `ar`. `same` will hold the count of consecutive elements equal to `num` at the end of the last sequence of equal elements and is now 1. `minn` will hold the minimum count of consecutive equal elements encountered during the entire iteration, updated to be the minimum between its current value and `same` if `minn` was not initially `inf`. `num` will hold the last unique number encountered in the list and is now `ar[0]`. If `minn` was initially `inf`, it remains `inf`; otherwise, it is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements. `i` will be equal to the length of `ar` after the loop terminates. `n` is an input integer. `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `minn` is `inf`.**
