The code snippet provided attempts to update the variable `minn` to the minimum value between its current value and `same`. However, the initial state does not specify any initial value for `minn` or `same`. Therefore, the exact values of these variables post-execution cannot be determined from the given information. However, we can describe the state in terms of these variables.

Given that `minn` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `same`, we can express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `ar` must have a length greater than 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`.**
