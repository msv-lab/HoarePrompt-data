To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `ar`.

The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least `i + 1` elements.
- `i` is either 3 or 4.

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

1. If `i` is 3, then `ar` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute again (`i < len(ar)` translates to `3 < len(ar)`).
2. If `i` is 4, then `ar` must have at least 5 elements for the loop to execute again (`i < len(ar)` translates to `4 < len(ar)`).

The other variables (`same`, `minn`, `num`, and `n`) are not part of the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Given the above, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `ar` has enough elements for the loop to execute one more time, based on the current value of `i`.

State: **`ar` must have at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `same` is either 1 or 3, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, `num` is either the first element of `ar`, the element at index `i` - 1 of `ar`, or `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `n` is an input integer**.
