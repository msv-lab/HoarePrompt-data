To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how the variables change based on the input list `ar`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `ar`: List of integers
   - `i`: 1
   - `same`: 1
   - `minn`: `inf`
   - `num`: `ar[0]`
   - `n`: Input integer (not used in the loop)

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(ar)`.
   - If `ar[i] == num`, it increments `same`.
   - If `ar[i] != num`, it updates `i`, `num`, and `minn`:
     - `i` is incremented by 1.
     - `num` is set to `ar[i]`.
     - `minn` is updated to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
     - `same` is reset to 1.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

### Final State:
- The loop will iterate through the entire list `ar`.
- `i` will be equal to `len(ar)` at the end of the loop.
- `same` will be the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements.
- `minn` will be the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found in the list.
- `num` will be the last element in the list `ar`.

### Output State:
- `ar`: Unchanged (remains the input list).
- `i`: `len(ar)` (after the loop completes).
- `same`: Count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements.
- `minn`: Minimum count of consecutive equal elements in the list.
- `num`: Last element of the list `ar`.
- `n`: Unchanged (remains the input integer).

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the final state:
- Suppose `ar = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]`.

**Iteration Details:**
1. `i = 1`, `same = 2`, `minn = inf`, `num = 1` (since `ar[1] == ar[0]`).
2. `i = 2`, `same = 1`, `minn = 2`, `num = 2` (since `ar[2] != ar[1]`).
3. `i = 3`, `same = 2`, `minn = 2`, `num = 2` (since `ar[3] == ar[2]`).
4. `i = 4`, `same = 3`, `minn = 2`, `num = 2` (since `ar[4] == ar[3]`).
5. `i = 5`, `same = 1`, `minn = 2`, `num = 3` (since `ar[5] != ar[4]`).
6. `i = 6`, `same = 2`, `minn = 2`, `num = 3` (since `ar[6] == ar[5]`).
7. `i = 7`, `same = 2`, `minn = 2`, `num = 3` (loop ends).

### Final Output State:
- `ar`: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]`
- `i`: `7` (length of `ar`)
- `same`: `2` (last sequence of consecutive elements is `3, 3`)
- `minn`: `2` (minimum sequence length is `2`)
- `num`: `3` (last element in `ar`)
- `n`: Unchanged (input integer)

Output State: **ar is [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3], i is 7, same is 2, minn is 2, num is 3, n is unchanged.**

In natural language: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar`, `same` will be the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements, `minn` will be the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found in the list, `num` will be the last element of the list `ar`, and `n` will remain unchanged.
