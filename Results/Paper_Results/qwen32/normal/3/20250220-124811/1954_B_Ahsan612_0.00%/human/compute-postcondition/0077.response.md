Postcondition: **`i` will be equal to the length of `ar` because the loop continues until this condition is met; `same` will be 1 if the last sequence of consecutive elements in `ar` has only one element, or it will be the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements if they are more than one; `minn` will be a finite value that is less than or equal to the current value of `same`; `num` will be the last unique number encountered in the list.**
