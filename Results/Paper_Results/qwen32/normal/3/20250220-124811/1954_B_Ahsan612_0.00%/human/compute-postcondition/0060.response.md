The code snippet `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to the value of `ar[i]`. The other variables (`i`, `ar`, `same`, `minn`) are not directly modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `ar` has a length greater than 1, `same` is 1 if `ar[i]` did not equal `num` initially, otherwise `same` is incremented by 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the previous value of `same` if `ar[i]` did not equal `num` initially.**
