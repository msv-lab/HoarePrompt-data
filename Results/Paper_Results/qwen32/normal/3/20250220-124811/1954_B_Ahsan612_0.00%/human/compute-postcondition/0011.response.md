The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after the operation, `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input value must be an integer within the range 1 to 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is 2; `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`**.
