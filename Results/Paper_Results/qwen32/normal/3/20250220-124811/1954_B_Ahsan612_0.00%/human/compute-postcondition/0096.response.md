Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is either 2 or 3, `same` is either 1 or 2, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i` - 1 of `ar`, and `n` is an input integer. If `ar[i]` - 1 is equal to `num`, then `i` is 2, `same` is 2, and `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 3, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `num` is updated to the element at index `i` - 1 of `ar`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged unless `i` was initially 2, in which case `i` becomes 3, and the conditions involving `i` and `num` are updated accordingly.
