The code snippet provided is `same += 1`, which increments the value of the variable `same` by 1. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that is altered by this line of code is `same`. The values of `i`, `ar`, `num`, and `minn` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` must be less than the length of `ar`, `ar` has a length greater than 1, `same` is incremented by 1, `num` is set to `ar[2]` if `ar[i]` did not equal `num` initially, otherwise `same` is incremented by 1, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the previous value of `same` if `ar[i]` did not equal `num` initially.**
