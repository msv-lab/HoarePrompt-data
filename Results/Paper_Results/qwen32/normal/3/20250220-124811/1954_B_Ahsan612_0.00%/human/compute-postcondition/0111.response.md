Postcondition: **`ar` must have at least `i + 1` elements. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, then `i` is either 3 or 4, `same` is either 2 or 4, and `minn` is either `inf` or 1. Otherwise, if `ar[i]` does not equal `num`, then `i` is either 4 or 5, `same` is 1, and `minn` is either 1 or `inf`. `num` is either the first element of `ar`, the element at index `i` - 1 of `ar`, or `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `n` remains an input integer.**
