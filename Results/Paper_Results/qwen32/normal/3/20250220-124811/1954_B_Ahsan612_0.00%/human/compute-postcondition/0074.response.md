The given code snippet is:
```python
minn = min(minn, same)
```

This line of code updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` will be equal to the length of `ar` because the loop continues until this condition is met.
- `same` will be 1 if the last sequence of consecutive elements in `ar` has only one element, or it will be the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements if they are more than one.
- `minn` will be the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found in the list.
- `num` will be the last unique number encountered in the list.

After executing `minn = min(minn, same)`, the value of `minn` will be updated to the smaller of its current value and the value of `same`.

Output State: **`i` will be equal to the length of `ar` because the loop continues until this condition is met; `same` will be 1 if the last sequence of consecutive elements in `ar` has only one element, or it will be the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements if they are more than one; `minn` will be the minimum of its current value and `same`; `num` will be the last unique number encountered in the list.**
