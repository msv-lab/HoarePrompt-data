Postcondition: **The loop will continue until `i` is equal to the length of `ar`. `same` will hold the count of consecutive elements equal to `num` at the end of the last sequence of equal elements. `minn` will hold the minimum count of consecutive equal elements encountered during the entire iteration, updated to be the minimum between its current value and `same` if `minn` was not initially `inf`. `num` will hold the last unique number encountered in the list. If `minn` was initially `inf`, it remains `inf`; otherwise, it is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements. `i` will be equal to the length of `ar` after the loop terminates.**
