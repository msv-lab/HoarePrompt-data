The code snippet `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to the value of `ar[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `num` will now hold the value of `ar[3]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input value `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 2. `i` is 3. `num` is `ar[3]`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2 and `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented to 2.**
