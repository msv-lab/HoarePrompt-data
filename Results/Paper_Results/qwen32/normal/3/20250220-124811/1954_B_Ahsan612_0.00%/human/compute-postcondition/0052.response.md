The value of `num` is assigned the value of `ar[i]`. Given that `i` is 2 and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` before this assignment, after the assignment `num` will hold the value of `ar[2]`. The values of `i` and the condition that `ar` must have a length greater than 1 remain unchanged. The condition that `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` before the assignment is no longer applicable after the assignment since `num` now equals `ar[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `ar` must have a length greater than 1, `num` is `ar[2]`**.
