The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `len(ar)` is stated to be `len(ar) + 1`, which is a contradiction. However, we will proceed based on the initial state provided. Therefore, after incrementing `i`, it will be equal to `len(ar) + 1`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1`, `len(ar)` must be `len(ar) + 1`**.
