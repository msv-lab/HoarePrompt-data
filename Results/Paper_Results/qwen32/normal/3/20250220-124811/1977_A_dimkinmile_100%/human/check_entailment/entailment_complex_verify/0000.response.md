Let's analyze the problem and the provided code systematically using the annotated version and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis
Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move. We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Key Observations
1. **Maximum Cubes**: The maximum number of cubes Nikita can have after `n` moves is `n` (if he adds one cube in each move).
2. **Minimum Cubes**: The minimum number of cubes Nikita can have after `n` moves is `0` (if he removes one cube in each move).
3. **Even Difference**: To end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) cancels out, and we need an even number of such pairs to reach the exact count `m`.

### Correct Condition
The correct condition should be:
- `n >= m` (to ensure it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves).
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` (to ensure the difference is even).

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code uses the condition:
```python
if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

### Annotations
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program:
- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 100`.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that `1 <= n, m <= 100`.
- The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is checked. If true, "Yes" is printed; otherwise, "No" is printed.

### Issues in the Provided Code
The condition `n - m >= 0` is incorrect. It should be `n >= m` to correctly reflect the problem requirements.

### Counterexample
- Input: `1 2 1`
- Expected Output: `Yes` (Nikita can add one cube and then remove one cube to end up with 1 cube after 2 moves).
- Actual Output: `No` (because `n - m >= 0` is true, but `n - m` is odd).

### Corrected Code
The corrected condition should be:
```python
if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n >= m:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program is incorrect due to the wrong condition. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem description.
