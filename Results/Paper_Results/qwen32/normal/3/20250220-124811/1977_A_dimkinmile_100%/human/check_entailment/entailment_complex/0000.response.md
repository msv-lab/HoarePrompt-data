### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube. 

The key observation here is that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` should be even and non-negative because:
1. Each move can either add or remove one cube.
2. To end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the net effect of these moves should be `m`. If `n` is the total number of moves, and `m` is the final number of cubes, the difference `n - m` must be even because each pair of an addition and a removal (or vice versa) results in no net change, and any remaining moves must be either all additions or all removals, which means the difference must be even.
3. The difference `n - m` must also be non-negative because you cannot have more cubes than the number of moves (since you can only add cubes in a move).

The provided code correctly implements this logic. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, checks if `n - m` is a non-negative even number, and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No".

### Correctness:
Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
