Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step:

### Problem Analysis
Nikita can perform two types of operations:
1. Add exactly 1 cube to the tower.
2. Remove exactly 1 cube from the tower.

The task is to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after performing `n` moves. 

Let's consider the possible scenarios:
- If `m > n`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because even if Nikita adds a cube in every move, he can only add `n` cubes.
- If `m <= n`, the difference `n - m` must be even for it to be possible. This is because each operation (add or remove) changes the number of cubes by 1. To go from 0 cubes to `m` cubes with `n` moves, the number of add operations must be `m` and the number of remove operations must be `n - m`. The total number of operations (`n`) must be the sum of these two, and the difference `n - m` must be even to balance the operations.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases `kreker`. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`. In `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Let's verify if the conditions in `func_1()` correctly determine the possibility of ending up with `m` cubes after `n` moves:
- The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that `m` is not greater than `n` (i.e., it's possible to have at least `m` cubes if we start from 0).
- The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of add and remove operations is even, which is necessary to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Both conditions are correct and sufficient to determine the answer.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
