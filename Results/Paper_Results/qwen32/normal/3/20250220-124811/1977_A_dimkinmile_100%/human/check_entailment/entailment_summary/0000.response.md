Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if it is possible to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube. The key observation here is that the net effect of `n` moves can be any even integer between `-n` and `n` (inclusive), because each move changes the cube count by Â±1.

Given `n` moves, the difference between the final number of cubes (`m`) and the initial number of cubes (which is 0) must be achievable through these moves. This means `m` must be reachable from 0 in `n` moves, which translates to `m` being within the range `[-n, n]` and `(n - m)` being even (since each move changes the count by an odd number, and an even number of such changes is required to reach `m` from 0).

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `n - m` is non-negative and even. If so, it prints "Yes", indicating that it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. Otherwise, it prints "No".

The execution summary matches this logic and correctly describes the behavior of the program.

Correctness: **True**
