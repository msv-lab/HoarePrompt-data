The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This means that the values of `n` and `m` will be updated to whatever integers are provided in the input. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.**
