The initial state provides specific conditions for the variables `t`, `n`, and `m`. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet does not depend on the values of these variables. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. This does not affect the print statement.
2. **Variables `n` and `m`**: Both are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, either `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0`. These conditions do not influence the print statement either.

The `print('No')` statement is straightforward and does not involve any computation or evaluation of the variables `t`, `n`, or `m`.

Output: **No**
