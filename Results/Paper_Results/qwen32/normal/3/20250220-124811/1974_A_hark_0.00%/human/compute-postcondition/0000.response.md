Output State: **`t` is an input integer, such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, which means it now holds the integer value provided by the user input. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4 is still valid after the code execution.
