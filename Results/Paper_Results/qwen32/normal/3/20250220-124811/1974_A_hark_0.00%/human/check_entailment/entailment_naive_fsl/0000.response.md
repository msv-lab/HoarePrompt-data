Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the given icons. Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for `x` and `y`**:
   - The code incorrectly calculates `x` after placing `2x2` icons. Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` does not make logical sense. The term `bxsfory * 15` seems arbitrary and incorrect. The correct approach should be to subtract the number of `1x1` cells occupied by the `2x2` icons and then calculate how many additional `1x1` icons can be placed on the remaining cells.

2. **Incorrect Calculation for `bxsfory1`**:
   - The calculation for `bxsfory1` is also incorrect. The code attempts to calculate the remaining `1x1` icons and then determines how many screens are needed, but the logic is flawed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle some edge cases correctly. For example, when `x` and `y` are such that a combination of `2x2` and `1x1` icons can fill the screen more optimally than the current logic suggests.

To demonstrate the incorrectness, let's consider a test case:

**Input**:
```
1
11 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2
```

**Explanation**:
- We have 1 `2x2` icon and 11 `1x1` icons.
- The `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells.
- We can place 11 `1x1` icons in the remaining cells, but since the screen size is 15 cells, we need 1 screen for the `2x2` icon and another screen for the 11 `1x1` icons, totaling 2 screens.

However, the provided code will not output `2` for this case. The logic in `func_2` is flawed, leading to incorrect results for various inputs.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
