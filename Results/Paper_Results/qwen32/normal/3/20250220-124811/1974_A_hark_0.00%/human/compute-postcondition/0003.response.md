The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` implicitly with each iteration. Since `_` is not used within the loop, we don't need to adjust its state. Instead, we need to consider how the loop's continuation depends on `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be 1 less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, if `t` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would not execute again. Therefore, `t` must have been greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an input integer, such that 2 <= t <= 10^4**
