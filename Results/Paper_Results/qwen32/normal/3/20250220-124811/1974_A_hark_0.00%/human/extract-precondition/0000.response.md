Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**

The function `func_3` is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons respectively. However, the function signature provided does not include `x` and `y` as parameters, so the precondition is only about the number of test cases `t`.
