To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the values of the variables and the logic used to compute `ans`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Variables and Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable represents the number of test cases, but it is not directly used in the snippet provided.
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the list `inp`.
   - `inp` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `x` is the smallest element in `inp`.
   - `y` is the second smallest unique element in `inp` (or the same as `x` if all elements are the same).
   - `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

2. **Determine `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` is the smallest element in the list `inp`. This can be found using the `min` function.
   - `y` is the second smallest unique element in `inp`. To find `y`, we need to sort the unique elements of `inp` and pick the second one. If all elements are the same, `y` will be the same as `x`.

3. **Determine `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`. Since `y` is either the same as `x` or greater than `x`, we can simplify this to counting elements greater than `y`.

### Calculation of `ans`:

- If all elements in `inp` are the same, `x` and `y` will be the same, and `ans` will be 0 because no element can be greater than itself.
- If there are unique elements, `y` will be the second smallest unique element, and `ans` will be the count of elements greater than `y`.

### Output:

The `print(ans)` statement will output the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than the second smallest unique element (or the smallest element if all elements are the same).

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of elements in inp that are greater than the second smallest unique element in inp, or 0 if all elements are the same)**
