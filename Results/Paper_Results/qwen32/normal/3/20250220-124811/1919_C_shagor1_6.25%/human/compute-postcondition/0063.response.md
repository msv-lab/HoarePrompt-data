The provided code snippet `x == y` is a comparison operation, but it does not assign any value to any variable. It simply checks if `x` is equal to `y`. Since there is no assignment, no variables are modified, and the state of the program remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `a` is the next element in `inp` (the successor of the current `a` in the list)**.
