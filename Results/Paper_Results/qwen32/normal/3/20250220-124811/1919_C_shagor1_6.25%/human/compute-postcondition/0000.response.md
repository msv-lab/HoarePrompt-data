In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the range is determined by `int(input())`. The variable `_` is a conventional throwaway variable used when the loop variable is not needed. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which corresponds to `t` as described in the state before the loop starts.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the value of `int(input())` is at least 1, because the loop will iterate `t` times, and `t` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer in the range 1 to 10^4, the state before the loop starts already ensures that the loop can execute. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

Here is the state before the loop starts, with the understanding that no further adjustments are necessary:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
