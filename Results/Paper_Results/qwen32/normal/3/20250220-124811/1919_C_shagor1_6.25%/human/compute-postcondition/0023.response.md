Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `x` is `a` if `a <= x` else `x` remains `n + 1`, `y` is the next element in the list `inp` if `a <= y` else `y` is `a`, `ans` is 0 if `a <= y` else `ans` is 1 if `a <= y` else `ans` is 2, `a` is the next element in the list `inp`.**
