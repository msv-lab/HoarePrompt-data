The code snippet `y = a` assigns the value of `a` to the variable `y`. This means that `y` will now hold the value of the next element in the list `inp`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `inp`, `x`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `x` is `a` if `a <= x` else `x` remains `n + 1`, `y` is the next element in the list `inp`, `ans` is 0 if `a <= y` else `ans` is 1, `a` is the next element in the list `inp`.**
