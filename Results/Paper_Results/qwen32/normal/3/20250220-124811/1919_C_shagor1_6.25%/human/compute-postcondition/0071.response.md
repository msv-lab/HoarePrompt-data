`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The precondition that `iterations` must be one more than the number of completed iterations is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`iterations` must be one more than the number of completed iterations; `n` is an input integer**.
