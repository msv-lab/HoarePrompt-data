The code snippet `*inp, = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and then unpacks these integers into the variable `inp` as a list.

Given the initial state, `iterations` and `n` remain unchanged. The new variable `inp` is created and assigned the list of integers from the input. 

Output State: **`iterations` must be one more than the number of completed iterations; `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers from the input.**
