In the provided for loop, the loop head contains the expression `int(input())`, which means the number of iterations is determined by the integer value input by the user. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the input that will be provided to `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, the input must be a positive integer.

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer.**
