You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a
big road that will divide the village into left and right sides. Each resident
wants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is
described as a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident
of the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,
a_j = 1 .

The road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be
declared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the
right-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then
the houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the
street, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road
also may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the
entire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.

To make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half
of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.
That is, among x residents on one side, at least \lceil\frac{x}{2}\rceil
should want to live on that side, where \lceil x \rceil denotes rounding up a
real number x .

To the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j
there must be at least \lceil\frac{i}{2}\rceil zeros. To the right of the
road, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at
least \lceil\frac{n-i}{2}\rceil ones.

Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the
described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.
Formally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \left|\frac{n}{2} -
i\right| .

If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \left|\frac{n}{2}
- i\right| , output the smaller one.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le
3\cdot 10^5 ). The next line of each test case contains a string a of length n
, consisting only of 0 and 1 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number i — the position of the house after
which the road should be laid (if it should be laid before the first house,
output 0 ). We can show that the answer always exists.

Note

Let's consider the first example of input data.

If we lay the road after the first house, there will be one house a_1 = 1 on
the left side of the street, the resident of which would like to live on the
right side of the street. Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be
satisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after
house 1 .

If we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left
side (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the
right side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice. More
than half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which
means that the road can be laid after house 2 . We can show that this is the
optimal answer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets all the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the optimal position to build a road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side.
- The road can be built between any two houses or before the first house or after the last house.
- If there are multiple optimal positions, the one closest to the middle of the village should be chosen. If there are still ties, the smaller position should be chosen.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()` - This function handles the logic for a single test case.
2. `func_2()` - This function handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

#### `func_1()` Breakdown:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - It reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.
   
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - It calculates a prefix sum array `S` where `S[i]` contains the count of '0's and '1's up to the `i`-th house.
   - `S[i][0]` is the count of '0's up to the `i`-th house.
   - `S[i][1]` is the count of '1's up to the `i`-th house.
   
3. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - It iterates through each possible position `i` where the road can be built.
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of satisfied residents on the left and right sides.
   - It checks if the number of satisfied residents on each side meets the condition.
   - It keeps track of the position `ans` that minimizes the absolute difference from the middle of the village, breaking ties by choosing the smaller position.

#### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly calculates the prefix sums and uses them to determine the number of satisfied residents on each side.
- The condition to check if the residents are satisfied is correctly implemented using the ceiling function's logic (`left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum`).
- The program keeps track of the optimal position and updates it when a better position is found.
- The program handles edge cases such as when the road is built before the first house or after the last house.

### Testing with Example Inputs:
Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `3\n101`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: The road should be built after the second house.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `6\n010111`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: The road should be built after the third house.

#### Example 3:
- Input: `6\n011001`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: The road should be built after the second house.

#### Example 4:
- Input: `3\n000`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: The road should be built after the third house.

#### Example 5:
- Input: `3\n110`
- Output: `0`
- Explanation: The road should be built before the first house.

#### Example 6:
- Input: `3\n001`
- Output: `0`
- Explanation: The road should be built before the first house.

#### Example 7:
- Input: `4\n1100`
- Output: `1`
- Explanation: The road should be built after the first house.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the provided examples and edge cases. It meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case that I can think of.

Correctness: **True**.
