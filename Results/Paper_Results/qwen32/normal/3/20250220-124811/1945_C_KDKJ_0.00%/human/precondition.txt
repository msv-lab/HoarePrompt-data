The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses in the village. The following line contains a string a of length n, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where '0' indicates that the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side of the street, and '1' indicates that the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the right side of the street. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
