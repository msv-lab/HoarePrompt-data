Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. It calculates and prints the index `i` closest to `n / 2` where the number of '0's to the left of `i` is at least half of the total elements to the left, and the number of '1's to the right of `i` is at least half of the total elements to the right.**
