The code snippet `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Since `x` is part of the last sublist in the list `S`, this change will reflect in `S` as well. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of houses, `a` is a non-empty string input by the user with at least 3 characters, `s` is the third character of the string `a`, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x + 1, y]]`**.
