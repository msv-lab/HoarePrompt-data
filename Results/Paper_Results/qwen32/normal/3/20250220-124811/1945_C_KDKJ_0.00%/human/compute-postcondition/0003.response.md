To provide an accurate output state, I need to know the definition of the function `func_1()`. Since the function `func_1()` is not provided, I will assume a generic behavior for the sake of this example. Let's assume `func_1()` does something like incrementing a counter variable `count` by 1 if it exists, and if not, it initializes `count` to 1.

Given this assumption:

Initial State: The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer, and the remaining number of iterations is greater than 0.

```
func_1()
```

Assuming `func_1()` is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1():
    global count
    if 'count' in globals():
        count += 1
    else:
        count = 1
```

Impact of the code on the program:
- If `count` exists, it is incremented by 1.
- If `count` does not exist, it is initialized to 1.

Since the initial state does not specify that `count` exists, we will assume it does not and thus `count` will be initialized to 1.

Output State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer, and the remaining number of iterations is greater than 0; `count` is 1.**

This output state includes the precondition that the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer and the remaining number of iterations is greater than 0, and it updates the value of `count` to 1 as per the assumed behavior of `func_1()`.
