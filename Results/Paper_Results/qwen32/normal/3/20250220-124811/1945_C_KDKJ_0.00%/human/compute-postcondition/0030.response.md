The code snippet `rsum = n - lsum` calculates the value of `rsum` by subtracting `lsum` from `n`. The values of `n` and `lsum` are known from the initial state, and `rsum` is newly calculated based on these values.

Given:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `lsum` is 0 (as per the initial state).

Therefore, `rsum` will be equal to `n` because `n - 0` is `n`.

The other variables (`S`, `ans`, `satisfy`, `i`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], ..., [count_0, count_not_0]]`; `ans` is 0; `satisfy` is 0; `i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `left` is 0; `lsum` is 0; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`; `rsum` is `n`.**
