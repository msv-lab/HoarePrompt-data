Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], ..., [count_0, count_not_0]]`; `ans` is 0; `satisfy` is 0; `i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `left` is 0; `lsum` is 0; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`; `rsum` is `n`; additionally, either `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` holds true.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change any of the variables or the conditions provided. The program simply continues to the next iteration of the loop without making any modifications to the current state of the variables.
