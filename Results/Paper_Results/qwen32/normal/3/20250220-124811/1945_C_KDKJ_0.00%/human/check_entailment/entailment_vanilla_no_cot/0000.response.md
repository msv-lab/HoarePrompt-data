Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical error in the condition checking and the update of the answer. Specifically, the condition `elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):` is incorrect because it does not ensure that we are selecting the smaller index when the absolute distances are equal. To fix this, we should update the answer only when the new position is strictly closer to the middle or when it is equally close but has a smaller index.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        (x, y) = S[-1]
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        S.append([x, y])
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        left = S[i][0]
        lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]
        right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
        rsum = n - lsum
        if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
            continue
        elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans) or (abs(n / 2 - i) == abs(n / 2 - ans) and i < ans):
            ans = i
    print(ans)
```

This ensures that if two positions have the same distance to the middle, the smaller index is chosen.
