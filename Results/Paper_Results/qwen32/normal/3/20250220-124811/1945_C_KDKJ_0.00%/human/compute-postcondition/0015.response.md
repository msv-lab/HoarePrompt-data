Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of houses, `a` is a non-empty string input by the user, `s` is the second character of the string `a`, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`. If `s` equals '0', `x` is `2` and `y` is `0`. Otherwise, `x` is `1` if `s` equals '0', and `0` otherwise, and `y` is `1` if `s` equals '0', or `2` if `s` does not equal '0'.**

To clarify, if `s` is '0', then `x` becomes `2` and `y` becomes `0`. If `s` is not '0', then `x` becomes `0` and `y` becomes `2`. The value of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
