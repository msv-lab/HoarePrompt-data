`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variables `start` and `end` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, and `t` is an input integer.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer.**
