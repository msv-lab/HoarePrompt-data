Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only considers the possibility of forming squares (polygons with 4 sides) and does not account for forming other regular polygons such as triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc. 

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
3
3 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation: With three sticks of length 3, we can form an equilateral triangle (a regular polygon with 3 sides).

However, the provided program will output `0` for this input because it only checks for the number of squares that can be formed (i.e., it checks how many times a stick can form groups of 4).

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the general case of forming any regular polygon, only squares.
