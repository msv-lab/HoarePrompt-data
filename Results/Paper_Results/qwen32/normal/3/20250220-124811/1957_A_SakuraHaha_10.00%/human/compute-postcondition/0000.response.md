The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer represents the number of sticks for the current test case. The other variables and conditions mentioned in the initial state (such as the lengths of the sticks) are not affected by this single line of code.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks. This is followed by a line containing `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The total number of test cases is given by the first integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) in the input. `n` is an integer read from the input.**
