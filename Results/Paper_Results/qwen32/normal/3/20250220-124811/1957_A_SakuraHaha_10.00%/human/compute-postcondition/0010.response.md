Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks (with `n` ≥ 1), `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with each unique stick length as keys and their respective counts as values.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cnt` will contain a count of each unique stick length in the list `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
