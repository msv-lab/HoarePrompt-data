The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `a`.

Given the initial state, the variable `n` represents the number of sticks, and the next line of input contains `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. After executing the given code, the list `a` will contain these `n` integers.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks. This is followed by a line containing `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The total number of test cases is given by the first integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) in the input. `n` is an integer read from the input. `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks.**
