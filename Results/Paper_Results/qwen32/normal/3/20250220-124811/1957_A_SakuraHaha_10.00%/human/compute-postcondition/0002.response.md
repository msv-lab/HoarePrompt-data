The provided code snippet initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This action does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks. This is followed by a line containing `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The total number of test cases is given by the first integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) in the input. `n` is an integer read from the input. `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. `ans` is 0.**
