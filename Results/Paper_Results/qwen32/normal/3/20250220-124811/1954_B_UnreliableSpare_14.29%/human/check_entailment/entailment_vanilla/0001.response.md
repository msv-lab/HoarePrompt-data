Let's analyze the provided Python program against the problem description and the given examples.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given "beautiful" array to make it no longer beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if, for any index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq |a| - 1 \)), if \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \), then \( a_i \) can be replaced with \( a_{i-1} \) (or \( a_{i+1} \)) to maintain the same value throughout the array. The aim is to find the smallest number of removals required to break this property.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.

2. **Initial Check for Uniform Array:**
   - The program checks if the array is uniform (all elements are the same). If it is, it immediately prints `-1` because removing any number of elements from a uniform array will still leave it uniform and beautiful.

3. **Finding the Minimum Sequence Length:**
   - The program then iterates through the array to find the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of the same element.
   - It keeps track of the minimum length of any such subsequence found.
   - If the array is not uniform, it prints the minimum length of such subsequences.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removals:**
   - The program incorrectly identifies the minimum number of removals as the length of the shortest contiguous subsequence of the same element. This is not necessarily the correct approach because removing elements from a longer sequence might still leave a shorter sequence intact, which could still be beautiful.
   - For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the shortest contiguous subsequence of the same element is `[5]` (length 1), but removing this single element does not make the array non-beautiful since the remaining array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` is still beautiful.

2. **Handling of Non-Uniform Arrays:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is not uniform. It should consider the structure of the array and the positions of different elements to determine the minimum number of removals required to break the beautiful property.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
