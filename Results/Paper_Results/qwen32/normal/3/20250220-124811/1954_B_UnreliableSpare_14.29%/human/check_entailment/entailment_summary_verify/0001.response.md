### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
An array is "beautiful" if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \). We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful, or determine if it's impossible.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initial Check for Uniform Array:**
   - The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `-1` because no removal can make the array non-beautiful.
   - This part of the logic is correct.

2. **Finding the Minimum Sequence Length:**
   - The program then iterates through the array to find the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of the same element.
   - It keeps track of the minimum length of any such subsequence found.
   - The program then prints this minimum length.
   - This part of the logic is incorrect. The minimum length of a contiguous subsequence does not directly translate to the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removals:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of removals required is the length of the shortest contiguous subsequence of the same element. This is not necessarily true.
   - For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The shortest contiguous subsequence of the same element is `[5]` (length 1). Removing this single element does not make the array non-beautiful since the remaining array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` is still beautiful.
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider more complex strategies, such as identifying critical points in the array where different elements are adjacent and determining the minimal set of removals that disrupt the beautiful property.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed, and the program does not handle the structure of the array correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
