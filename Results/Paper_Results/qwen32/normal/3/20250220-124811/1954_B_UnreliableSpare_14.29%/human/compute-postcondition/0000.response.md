The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means `n` will now hold the specific value provided by the input, while the other variables, `t` and `a`, remain unchanged. Given the initial state, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `a` is still a list of integers with specific properties.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
