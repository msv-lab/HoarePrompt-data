The code snippet assigns the variable `ans` the value `Decimal('Infinity')`. This means `ans` is now set to positive infinity. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `flag`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `flag` is True if `arr[0] == arr[1] == ... == arr[n-1]`, otherwise `flag` is False; `ans` is Decimal('Infinity').**
