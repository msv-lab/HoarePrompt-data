Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`; `flag` is False; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `i`, and `flag` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
