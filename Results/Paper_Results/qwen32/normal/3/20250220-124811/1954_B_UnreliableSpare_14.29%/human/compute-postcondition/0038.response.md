To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the value of `ans` based on the provided initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the given information:

1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable seems to be related to the number of test cases or iterations, but it does not directly affect the calculation of `ans` in the context of a single execution.
2. `n` is greater than 0. This is the length of the list `a` and `arr`.
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\). This list is not directly used in the calculation of `ans`, but it is mentioned for context.
4. `arr` is a list of integers read from the input. This list is used to determine the value of `ans`.
5. `flag` is `False` because not all elements in `arr` are equal. This flag does not affect the value of `ans` directly.
6. `val` is `arr[0]`. This is the first element of the list `arr`.
7. `i` is `n`. This variable seems to be a loop counter or an index, but it does not directly affect the value of `ans` in the final print statement.
8. `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of elements equal to `val` if the last sequence is equal to `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 0. This variable keeps track of the length of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to `val`.
9. `ans` is the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val` found in `arr`, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.

Given these points, `ans` is calculated as the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to `val` (which is `arr[0]`).

Since `ans` is calculated based on the sequences of elements in `arr` that are equal to `val`, the exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values in `arr`. However, we can describe `ans` precisely based on the initial state.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements equal to arr[0] found in arr)**
