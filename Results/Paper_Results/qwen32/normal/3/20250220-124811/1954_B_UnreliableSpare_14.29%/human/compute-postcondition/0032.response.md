Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `flag` is True if `arr[0] == arr[1] == ... == arr[n-1]`, otherwise `flag` is False; `val` is `arr[0]`; `i` is 2; `cnt` is 1, 2, or 3 if `arr[i]` equals `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 0 or 1; `ans` is Decimal('Infinity') if `cnt` was 2 before the if-else block and `arr[i]` equals `val`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if `cnt` is 2 and `arr[i]` does not equal `val`, or 0 if `cnt` is not 2.**
