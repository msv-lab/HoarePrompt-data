Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Logic for determining "beauty"**: The program checks if all elements are the same to determine if the array is beautiful. However, the problem definition of a beautiful array is more complex. An array is beautiful if, by repeatedly applying the specified operation, all elements can be made the same. The given program does not account for this more complex definition.

2. **Logic for calculating the minimum removals**: The program attempts to find the smallest contiguous segment of identical elements and uses this to determine the minimum removals. However, this approach does not guarantee that removing this segment will make the array stop being beautiful. The correct approach should involve analyzing the structure of the array and determining the minimum number of removals that disrupt the ability to make all elements the same through the described operation.

3. **Handling of edge cases**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the array can be made not beautiful by removing a specific number of elements. It incorrectly assumes that finding the smallest segment of identical elements is sufficient.

A correct solution would involve a more detailed analysis of the array structure and the application of the operation, possibly using dynamic programming or a similar approach to determine the minimum number of removals needed.
