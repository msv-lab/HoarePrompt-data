To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior.

The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive). In each iteration, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is different from the previous element `arr[i-1]`. If they are different, the `flag` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. If they are the same, the loop continues to the next iteration.

The loop will execute all iterations if and only if all elements in `arr` are the same (i.e., `arr[0] == arr[1] == ... == arr[n-1]`). In this case, the `flag` will remain `True` after all iterations.

If the loop breaks at any point, it means that there was at least one pair of consecutive elements that were different, and the `flag` will be `False`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state will be:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `flag` will be `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, it will be `False`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `flag` is True if `arr[0] == arr[1] == ... == arr[n-1]`, otherwise `flag` is False.**
