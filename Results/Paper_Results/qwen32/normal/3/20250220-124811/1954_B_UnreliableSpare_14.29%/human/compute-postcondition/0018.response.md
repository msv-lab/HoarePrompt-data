The code snippet assigns the value of `arr[0]` to `val` and initializes `cnt` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `flag`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `flag` is True if `arr[0] == arr[1] == ... == arr[n-1]`, otherwise `flag` is False; `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'); `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is 0.**
