### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Identifying if the array is uniform:**
   - The program uses a flag (`flag`) to check if all elements in the array are the same. If all elements are the same, the flag remains `True`; otherwise, it is set to `False`. This part is correct and aligns with the problem's requirement to determine if the array is beautiful in its simplest form (all elements identical).

2. **Finding the minimum sequence of consecutive elements:**
   - The program then tries to find the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements that are the same (`ans`). It does this by iterating through the array and counting consecutive elements that match the current `val` (initially set to `arr[0]`). Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum count so far and resets the count.
   - The final `ans` is updated one last time to account for the last sequence of elements.

3. **Output:**
   - If the array is uniform (all elements the same), the program correctly outputs `-1` as per the problem statement.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements that are the same (`ans`). However, this output does not necessarily represent the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Issues with the Program:
- The core issue is that the program's logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The problem requires finding the minimum number of removals to make the array non-beautiful, not the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements that are the same.
- The program does not correctly compute the minimum number of removals required to break the beautiful property of the array. It only identifies the shortest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same, which is not a valid solution to the problem.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
