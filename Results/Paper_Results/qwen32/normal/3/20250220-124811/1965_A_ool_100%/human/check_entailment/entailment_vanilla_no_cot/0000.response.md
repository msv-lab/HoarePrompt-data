Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all possible test cases. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed, particularly in the way it determines the winner based on the sorted unique values of the piles. 

Here's a more detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Winning Strategy**: The game can be analyzed using the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) from combinatorial game theory. If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy. If it is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The current logic in `func_1` checks if the smallest pile is not 1 and returns 'Alice' if true. This is incorrect because the game's outcome depends on the Nim-sum of the pile sizes, not just the smallest pile. Additionally, the logic involving `not_c` and the XOR operation is not correctly implemented.

Here is the correct implementation using the Nim-sum approach:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    nim_sum = 0
    for a in arr:
        nim_sum ^= a
    print('Alice' if nim_sum != 0 else 'Bob')
```

This implementation correctly calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
