To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the conditions that affect the variables `A`, `not_c`, and `i`.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and iterates until `i` reaches `len(set_) - 1`.
2. **Condition Check**: For each iteration, it checks if the difference between `set_[i]` and `set_[i - 1]` is greater than 1.
3. **Effect on Variables**:
   - If `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, `not_c` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
   - If the condition is not met, `A` is toggled (i.e., `A = not A`).

### Observations from Given Output States:
- **After 1st Iteration**: `A` is `True`, `not_c` is `False` if `set_[1] - set_[0] > 1`.
- **After 2nd Iteration**: `A` is `False`, `not_c` is `False` if `set_[2] - set_[1] > 1`.
- **After 3rd Iteration**: `A` is `True`, `not_c` is `False` if `set_[3] - set_[2] > 1`.

### Final State Determination:
- The loop will continue until `i` reaches `len(set_) - 1`.
- The value of `A` will toggle with each iteration.
- The value of `not_c` will remain `True` unless a condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` is met, in which case it will become `False` and the loop will break.
- The final value of `i` will be `len(set_) - 1` if the loop does not break prematurely.

### Final Output State:
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `i` will be `len(set_) - 1`.
- The value of `A` will be `True` if the number of iterations is odd, and `False` if the number of iterations is even.
- `not_c` will be `True` if no `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` condition is met during any iteration, otherwise `False`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state depends on the number of unique elements in `set_` and whether any `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` condition is met.

**Output State**: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile; `A` is `True` if `(len(set_) - 2)` is odd, otherwise `False`; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1; `not_c` is `False` if any `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `True`; `i` is `len(set_) - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `A` will be `True` if the number of unique elements in `set_` (excluding the first element) is odd, and `False` if even. `not_c` will be `False` if there is any gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`, otherwise `True`. The loop counter `i` will be at the last index of `set_`.
