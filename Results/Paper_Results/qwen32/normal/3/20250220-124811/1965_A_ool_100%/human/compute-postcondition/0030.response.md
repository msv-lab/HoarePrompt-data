Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, where the first element represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function determines the winner of a game based on the unique stone counts across all test cases. If the smallest unique stone count is not 1, it returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks for gaps greater than 1 between consecutive unique stone counts. If no such gaps exist, it alternates the winner based on the count of unique stone counts (excluding the first element). If gaps exist, it alternates the winner based on the number of completed iterations. The final output is either 'Alice' or 'Bob'.**
