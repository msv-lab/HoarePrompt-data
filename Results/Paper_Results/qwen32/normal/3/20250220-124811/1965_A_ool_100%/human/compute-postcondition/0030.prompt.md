You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    if (set_[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns the string 'Alice'
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile; `A` is `False`; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1.
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: - If `not_c` remains `True` after all iterations, it means there were no gaps greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`. In this case, `A` will be `True` if the number of iterations (excluding the first element) is odd, and `False` if it is even.
    #- If `not_c` becomes `False` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks, and `A` will be `True` if the number of completed iterations (excluding the first element) is odd, and `False` if it is even.
    #
    #Given the information and the pattern observed, the final output state can be described as follows:
    #
    #If the loop completes all iterations without setting `not_c` to `False`, `A` will be `True` if the number of unique elements in `set_` (excluding the first element) is odd, and `False` if it is even. `not_c` will be `True`.
    #
    #If the loop breaks due to finding a gap greater than 1, `not_c` will be `False`, and `A` will be `True` if the number of completed iterations (excluding the first element) is odd, and `False` if it is even.
    #
    #Since the exact number of unique elements in `set_` is not provided, we will assume the loop completes all iterations without breaking. Therefore, the final output state is:
    #
    #Output State:
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: `not_c` is a boolean. If `not_c` is `True`, then the value of `A` is flipped (i.e., if `A` was `True`, it becomes `False`, and if `A` was `False`, it becomes `True`). If `not_c` is `False`, the value of `A` remains unchanged.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the value of A after it may have been flipped by not_c.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` in the list represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function returns the string 'Alice' in Case_1, and in Case_2, it returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the value of `A` after it may have been flipped by `not_c`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string 'Alice'

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the value of A after it may have been flipped by not_c.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
