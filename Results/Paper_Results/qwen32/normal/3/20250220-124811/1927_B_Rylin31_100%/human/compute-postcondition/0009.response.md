The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends a character to the string `ans` based on the value of `s[j]`. Here’s the breakdown of how the variables are affected:

- `ans` was initially a string with the value `'a'`. After the operation, `ans` will be `'a'` followed by the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.
- `s[j]` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state, so `s[j] + 97` will give the ASCII value of the character to be appended.
- The variables `t`, `l`, `array`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l` is an input integer; `s` is a list of length `l` with the element at index `j` incremented by 1; `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have more than one element; `ans` is a string with the value `'a'` followed by the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`; `j` is the next element in `array`.**
