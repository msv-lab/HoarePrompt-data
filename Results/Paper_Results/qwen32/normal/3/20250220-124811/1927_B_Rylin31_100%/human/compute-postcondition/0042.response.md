The code snippet `s[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the list `s` by 1. Given that `s[j]` was initially 1 (from the initial state), after the operation, `s[j]` will be 2.

Here are the variables and their states after the code execution:
- `i` remains `x + 1` because it is not affected by the code snippet.
- `l` remains an input integer because it is not affected by the code snippet.
- `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is now 2 (it was 1 before the operation).
- `array` remains a list of integers from the input because it is not affected by the code snippet.
- `ans` remains `'aa'` if `s[j]` was 0 (which it wasn't, so this condition is not met), otherwise `ans` remains `'ab'` (which it is, because `s[j]` was 1).
- `j` remains the next element in `array` because it is not affected by the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 2, `array` is a list of integers from the input, `ans` is `'ab'`, `j` is the next element in `array`.**
