The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which iterates over `array`. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `array` has at least one element. The other variables `i`, `l`, `s`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty string**
