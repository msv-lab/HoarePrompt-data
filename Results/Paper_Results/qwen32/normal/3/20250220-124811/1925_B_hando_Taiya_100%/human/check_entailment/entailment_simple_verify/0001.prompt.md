You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are integers such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `ans` is the maximum value found during the iterations that satisfies either `n <= x // i` or `n <= i` for `i` in the range from 1 to `isqrt(x)`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the maximum value of i in the range from 1 to isqrt(x) that satisfies either n <= x // i or n <= i)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's first analyze the problem requirements and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to break a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`, and the goal is to maximize the GCD of these sub-problems' difficulties.

### Key Observations:
1. **Dividing `x` into `n` parts**: The problem can be simplified by considering the factors of `x`. If `x` can be divided into `n` parts such that each part is a factor of `x`, the GCD of these parts will be maximized.
2. **Maximizing GCD**: To maximize the GCD, we need to consider the largest possible factor of `x` that can divide `x` into `n` parts. This means either `i` or `x/i` (where `i` is a factor of `x`) should be less than or equal to `n`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a loop to iterate through potential factors of `x` up to the integer square root of `x` (`isqrt(x)`). For each factor `i`, it checks if `i` or `x/i` can be the number of sub-problems (`n`). If so, it updates the maximum GCD found (`ans`).

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
2. **Factorization and Checking**:
   - It iterates through all potential factors `i` of `x` up to `isqrt(x)`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a factor (`x % i == 0`).
   - If `i` is a factor, it checks if `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`. If either condition is true, it updates `ans` with the maximum of the current `ans` and `i` or `x // i`.
3. **Output**: After checking all factors, it prints the maximum GCD found.

### Correctness Verification:
The logic of checking factors and updating the maximum GCD based on the conditions `n <= x // i` or `n <= i` is correct. This ensures that the GCD is maximized by considering the largest possible factor that can divide `x` into `n` parts.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the problemset. Therefore, the program is correct.
