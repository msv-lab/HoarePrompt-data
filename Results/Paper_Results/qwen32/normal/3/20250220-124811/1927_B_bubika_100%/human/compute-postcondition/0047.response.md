The code snippet `b[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `b` by 1. The other variables `s`, `a`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 element.
- `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`.
- `r` is updated to its current value plus `a[x]`.

After the execution of the code, the value at `b[x]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`s` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 element; `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`; `r` is updated to its current value plus `a[x]`; `b[x]` is increased by 1.**
