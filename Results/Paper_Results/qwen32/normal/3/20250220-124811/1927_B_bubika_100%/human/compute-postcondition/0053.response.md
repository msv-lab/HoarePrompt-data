To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code snippet on the variables. Given the initial state, `s` is a list of integers, and `i` is the next element in the list `s`. The code snippet `x = b.index(i)` attempts to find the index of `i` in the list `b`.

However, there is no mention of the list `b` in the initial state. Therefore, we must assume that `b` is another list of integers that contains the element `i`. Since the problem does not specify the contents of `b`, we can only express the output state in terms of the relationship between `b` and `i`.

Given that `i` is an element in `s`, and `x` is assigned the index of `i` in `b`, the output state will reflect this new assignment.

Output State: **`s` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 2 elements; `i` is the next element in the list `s`; `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`.**
