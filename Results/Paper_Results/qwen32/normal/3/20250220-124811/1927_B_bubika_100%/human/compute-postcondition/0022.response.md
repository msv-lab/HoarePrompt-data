The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the value of `n` to the integer value of the user's input. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers, `r` is a string formed by concatenating the characters from `a` corresponding to each number in `s`, `x` is the index of the last element in `s` in the list `b`, `i` is the last element in `s`**. 

In simpler terms, `n` is now the new integer input by the user, while all other variables retain their previous values.
