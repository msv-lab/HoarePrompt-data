t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) representing the length of the lost string, and a list a of n integers (0 <= a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid string s exists that corresponds to the given trace.
