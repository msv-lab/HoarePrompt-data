The code snippet `b[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` of the list `b` by 1. Given that `x` is 0, `b[0]` will be incremented by 1. Initially, `b[0]` is 2, so after the operation, `b[0]` will be 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t + 1`, `b` is a list of 26 zeros except `b[0]` which is 3, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must contain at least two elements, `r` is `2 * s[0] + a[0]`, `x` is 0, `i` is `s[1]`**.
