You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it checks if the input integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 50) is even. If `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the substring '110' `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string `s`; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Objective**: Construct a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
2. **Constraints**:
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 50` (number of test cases)
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 50` (number of special characters required)
   - The string length should be at most 200.
3. **Special Character Definition**:
   - A character is special if it matches exactly one of its neighbors. For example, in the string "AAABAACC":
     - 'A' at positions 1 and 3 are special because they match only one neighbor.
     - 'B' at position 5 is special because it matches only one neighbor.
     - 'A' at position 6 is special because it matches only one neighbor.
     - 'C' at positions 7 and 8 are special because they match only one neighbor.
4. **Output**:
   - If no such string exists, print "NO".
   - If a string exists, print "YES" followed by the string.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors (this is a key insight).
4. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` using the pattern "110" repeated `n // 2` times.
5. It checks if the length of `s` is less than 200 and prints "YES" followed by the string `s` if true, otherwise it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Pattern**: The pattern "110" is used, which does not consist of uppercase Latin letters as required by the problem statement. The problem specifies that the string should be composed of uppercase Latin letters.
2. **Validity of the Pattern**: Even if we replace "110" with uppercase letters, we need to verify if the pattern "XXY" (where X and Y are different letters) can indeed create the required number of special characters. The pattern "XXY" indeed creates two special characters (the Y's), so repeating it `n // 2` times will create `n` special characters if `n` is even.
3. **String Length**: Since `n` is at most 50, repeating "XXY" `n // 2` times will result in a string of length at most 150, which is well within the 200-character limit.

### Correct Program
To correct the program, we need to use uppercase Latin letters in the pattern. Here is the corrected version:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAAB' * (n // 2)  # Using 'AAAB' pattern to ensure uppercase Latin letters
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion
The original program is incorrect due to the use of non-Latin characters. However, the logic for determining the feasibility of the string and constructing it is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the original program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
