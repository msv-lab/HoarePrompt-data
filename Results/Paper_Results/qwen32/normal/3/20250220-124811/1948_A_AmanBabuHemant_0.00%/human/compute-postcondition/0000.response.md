The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases, and it is specified that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50. The value of `t` is now known and is no longer a range but a specific integer within the given range. The variable `n` and its constraints remain unchanged as they are associated with each test case, not the input for `t`.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50.**
