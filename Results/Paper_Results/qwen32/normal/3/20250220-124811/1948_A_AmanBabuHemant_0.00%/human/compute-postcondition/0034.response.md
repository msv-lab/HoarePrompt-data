Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it checks if the input integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 50) is even. If `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the substring '110' `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string `s`; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.**
