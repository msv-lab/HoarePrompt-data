The code snippet `s = '110' * (n // 2)` creates a new string `s` by repeating the substring `'110'` exactly `n // 2` times. Given that `n` is an even integer, `n // 2` will be an integer, and the string `s` will be composed of the repeated pattern `'110'`.

Since `n` is even, `n // 2` is an integer, and the string `s` will have a length of `3 * (n // 2)` because each repetition of `'110'` contributes 3 characters to the string.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an input even integer; `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.**
