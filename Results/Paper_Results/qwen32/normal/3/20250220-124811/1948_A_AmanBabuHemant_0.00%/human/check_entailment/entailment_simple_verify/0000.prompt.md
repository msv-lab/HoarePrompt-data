You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is a specific integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; the loop has executed `t` times; for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an input integer; if `n` is odd, the output is 'NO'; if `n` is even, then `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times; if the length of `s` is less than 200, the output is 'YES' followed by `s`; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not meet the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Character Set**: The problem description specifies that the string should be composed of uppercase Latin letters (A-Z), but the program generates a string using '1', '1', and '0', which are digits, not uppercase Latin letters.

2. **Special Characters**: The program checks if `n` is even and generates a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. However, the definition of a special character in the problem is that it must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. In the generated string, '1' is equal to both of its neighbors, and '0' is not equal to its neighbors, so none of the characters in the generated string would be special according to the problem's definition.

3. **String Length**: While the program ensures the generated string's length is less than 200, it does not address the requirement that the string must contain exactly `n` special characters.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:
- **Input**: `1`
- **Expected Output**: `NO` (since it's impossible to have exactly 1 special character with the given definition in a string of uppercase Latin letters)
- **Actual Output**: `NO` (correct in this specific case, but the logic is incorrect for other cases)

Another example:
- **Input**: `2`
- **Expected Output**: `YES\nAA` (since 'A' is equal to its neighbor, making it a special character)
- **Actual Output**: `YES\n110` (incorrect because '1' is not an uppercase Latin letter and does not meet the definition of a special character)

The program needs to be revised to generate strings using uppercase Latin letters and ensure that the string contains exactly `n` special characters as defined by the problem statement.
