The initial state provided describes several variables and conditions, but the key point for the `print` statement is that it simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The variables `t`, `n`, `s`, and `_` are defined based on certain conditions, but they do not affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of these variables and will output `'YES'` regardless of their values.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 50.
2. The variable `n` is a new input integer.
3. The variable `s` is defined based on whether `n` is odd or even. It is `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times in both cases.
4. The variable `_` is incremented by 1, but this does not affect the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```
This statement will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
