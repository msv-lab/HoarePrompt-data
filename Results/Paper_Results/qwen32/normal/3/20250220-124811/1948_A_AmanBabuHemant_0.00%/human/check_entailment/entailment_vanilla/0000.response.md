Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Objective**: Construct a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
2. **Constraints**:
   - `1 ≤ t ≤ 50` (number of test cases)
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 50` (number of special characters required)
   - The string length should be at most 200.
3. **Special Character Definition**:
   - A character is special if it matches exactly one of its neighbors. For example, in the string "AAABAACC":
     - 'A' at positions 1 and 3 are special because they match only one neighbor.
     - 'B' at position 5 is special because it matches only one neighbor.
     - 'A' at position 6 is special because it matches only one neighbor.
     - 'C' at positions 7 and 8 are special because they match only one neighbor.
4. **Output**:
   - If no such string exists, print "NO".
   - If a string exists, print "YES" followed by the string.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors (this is a key insight).
4. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` using the pattern "110" repeated `n // 2` times.
5. It checks if the length of `s` is less than 200 and prints "YES" followed by the string `s` if true, otherwise it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Pattern**: The pattern "110" is used, which does not consist of uppercase Latin letters as required by the problem statement. The problem specifies that the string should be composed of uppercase Latin letters.
2. **Validity of the Pattern**: Even if we replace "110" with uppercase letters, we need to verify if the pattern "XXY" (where X and Y are different letters) can indeed create the required number of special characters. The pattern "XXY" indeed creates two special characters (the Y's), so repeating it `n // 2` times will create `n` special characters if `n` is even.
3. **String Length**: Since `n` is at most 50, repeating "XXY" `n // 2` times will result in a string of length at most 150, which is well within the 200-character limit.

### Correct Program
To correct the program, we need to use uppercase Latin letters in the pattern. Here is the corrected version:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAAB' * (n // 2)  # Using 'AAAB' pattern to ensure uppercase Latin letters
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion
The original program is incorrect due to the use of non-Latin characters. However, the logic for determining the feasibility of the string and constructing it is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the original program is **False**.
