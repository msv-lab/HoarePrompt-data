Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is the new input integer and remains unchanged whether it is odd or even; if `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times; the length of `s` is either less than 200 or greater than or equal to 200 depending on the value of `n`; `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
