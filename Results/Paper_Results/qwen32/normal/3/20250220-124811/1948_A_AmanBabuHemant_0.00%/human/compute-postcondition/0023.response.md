The only variable in the loop head is `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

Given that `t` is a specific integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and `_` has been incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment.

State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is the new input integer; if `n` is odd, `n` remains unchanged; if `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times; if the length of `s` is less than 200, it remains less than 200; otherwise, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200; `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
