Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; the loop has executed `t` times; for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an input integer; if `n` is odd, the output is 'NO'; if `n` is even, then `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times; if the length of `s` is less than 200, the output is 'YES' followed by `s`; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished executing for all `t` test cases. For each test case, if the input integer `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the substring `'110'` `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
