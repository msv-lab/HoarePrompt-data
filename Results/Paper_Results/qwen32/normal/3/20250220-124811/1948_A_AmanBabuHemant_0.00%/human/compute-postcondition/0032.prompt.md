Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a specific integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 50.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n % 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        s = '110' * (n // 2)
        if len(s) < 200:
            print('YES')
            print(s)
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a specific integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, then `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is even, then `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times; if the length of `s` is less than 200, it remains less than 200; otherwise, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a specific integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is the new input integer; if `n` is odd, `n` remains unchanged; if `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times; if the length of `s` is less than 200, it remains less than 200; otherwise, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 200; `_` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a specific integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is the new input integer and remains unchanged whether it is odd or even; if `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times; the length of `s` is either less than 200 or greater than or equal to 200 depending on the value of `n`; `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
