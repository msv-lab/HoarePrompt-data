Given the initial state, we have the following information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
- `n` is an even integer.
- `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` is less than 200.

The task is to determine what will be printed when the `print(s)` statement is executed.

Let's break down the value of `s`:

- Since `s` is formed by repeating the substring `'110'` `n // 2` times, the length of `s` will be `3 * (n // 2)`.
- Given that `n` is an even integer, `n // 2` will be an integer, and thus `s` will consist of a sequence of `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.

Without the exact value of `n`, we can't provide the exact string `s`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Thus, the output will be the string `s` which is `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.

Output: **'110' repeated (n // 2) times (where n is the given even integer input)**
