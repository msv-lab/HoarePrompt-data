The code snippet provided initializes a deque named `leaves`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the variables `nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` where each key (node) has a list of its neighbors as determined by the `n - 1` edges read from the input; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `n` is the number of nodes; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `i` is n - 1; `leaves` is a deque.**
