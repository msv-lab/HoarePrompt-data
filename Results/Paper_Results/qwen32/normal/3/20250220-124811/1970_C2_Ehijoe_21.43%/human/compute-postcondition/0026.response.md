The code appends the `key` to the `leaves` deque. This means that the `leaves` deque will now contain the `key` as an additional element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a `defaultdict` with at least one key-value pair, `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game such that 1 <= start <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree; `n` is the number of nodes; `t` is the second integer from the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `i` is n - 1; `leaves` is a deque containing the `key` as an additional element; `key` is the next key in the `nodes` dictionary.**
