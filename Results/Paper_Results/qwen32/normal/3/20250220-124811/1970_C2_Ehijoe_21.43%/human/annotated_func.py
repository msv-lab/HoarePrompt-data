    #The program returns the list `distances` which contains all the distances calculated from the `start` node to all reachable nodes, excluding paths that would revisit the `parent` node.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns a list of distances from a starting node to all reachable nodes in a graph, represented as a dictionary. The distances exclude paths that revisit the parent node. If the starting node is a leaf (has only one neighbor which is the parent), it returns `[0]`.

At least one element in `moves` is odd if the if condition is met; otherwise, none of the elements in `moves` are odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input to construct a tree represented by a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors. It identifies the leaf nodes and then determines the winner of a game based on the starting node and the moves calculated by another function `func_1`. The game's outcome is printed as either "Ron" or "Hermione" depending on whether any of the moves are odd.
