Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process with `arr` being a non-empty list; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` is a key in `freq`, then `count` is set to `freq[current_pair] + 1`. If `current_pair` is not a key in `freq`, then `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1 and `count` remains unchanged. `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process with `arr` being a non-empty list; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` was a key in `freq`, `count` is incremented by `freq[current_pair] + 1`. If `current_pair` was not a key in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is set to `1` and `count` remains unchanged. `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process with `arr` being a non-empty list; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` is already a key in `freq`, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `current_pair` is added to `freq` with a value of 1; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `a` is the next element in `arr` that has not been processed yet.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
