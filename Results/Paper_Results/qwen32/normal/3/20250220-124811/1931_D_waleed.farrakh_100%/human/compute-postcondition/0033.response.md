Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is an empty list; `freq` is a dictionary with an updated count for `current_pair`. If `current_pair` was already in `freq`, then `freq[(current_pair)]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `freq[(current_pair)]` is set to 1. `a` is the next element in `arr`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.**
