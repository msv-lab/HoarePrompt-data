Let's break down the given information step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`test_cases`**: A list containing `t` tuples. The exact tuples are not specified.
2. **`data`**: A list of strings. The exact strings are not specified.
3. **`t`**: An integer equal to `int(data[0])`. This implies that the first element of the `data` list is a string representation of an integer, and `t` is that integer.
4. **`idx`**: Calculated as `2 * t + 1`. This value is derived from the value of `t`.
5. **`results`**: A list containing at least three elements. The exact elements are not specified.

### The Print Statement:
The print statement is `print(result)`. However, there is a typo in the print statement. It should be `print(results)` to match the given initial state. Assuming the intention was to print `results`, we will proceed with that.

### Determining the Output:
Since `results` is a list containing at least three elements, the `print(results)` statement will print the entire `results` list.

### Final Output Description:
The `print(results)` statement will output the `results` list, which contains at least three elements. The exact values of these elements are not specified in the initial state, so we describe the output in terms of the `results` list.

Output: **[results[0], results[1], results[2], ...] (where results is a list containing at least three elements)**
