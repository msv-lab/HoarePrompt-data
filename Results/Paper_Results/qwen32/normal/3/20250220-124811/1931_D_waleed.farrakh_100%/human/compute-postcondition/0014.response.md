The code increments the value of `idx` by 2. Given the initial state, `idx` is initially set to 3. After executing the code, `idx` becomes 5.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `data`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing two tuples `((n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0]) - 1` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 5, `n` is the first integer from `data[3]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from `data[3]` split by spaces, `y` is the third integer from `data[3]` split by spaces, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[idx + 1]` split by spaces and converted to integers.**
