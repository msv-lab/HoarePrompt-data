The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a common placeholder for a variable that we do not intend to use, it does not affect the state of the loop. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must have been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 after decrementing.

Given that `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0 at the start of the loop, after one iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be at least 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 3, `n` is the first integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `y` is the third integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[idx + 1]` split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Since `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, and it gets decremented by 1 in each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `t` decremented by 1 from its previous value.

Therefore, if `t` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it should be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0]) - 1` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 3, `n` is the first integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `y` is the third integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[idx + 1]` split by spaces and converted to integers.**

To generalize, if `t` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `k-1` at the start of the next iteration, and `k-1` must be greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0]) - 1` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 3, `n` is the first integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `y` is the third integer from `data[1]` split by spaces, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[idx + 1]` split by spaces and converted to integers.**

Since we are not given the exact value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent the state in terms of `t` being decremented by 1 and still greater than 0.
