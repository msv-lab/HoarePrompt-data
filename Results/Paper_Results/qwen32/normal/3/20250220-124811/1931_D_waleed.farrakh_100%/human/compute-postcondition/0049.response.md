Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process with `arr` being a non-empty list; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary with `current_pair` as a key and its value set to 1; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.**

Explanation: The value of `freq[current_pair]` has been updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
