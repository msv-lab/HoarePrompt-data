To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Given Initial State:
1. `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples.
2. `data` is a list of strings.
3. `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`.
4. `idx` is `2 * t + 1`.
5. `results` is a list containing at least one element.

### Analysis:
- The variable `result` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, the code attempts to print `result`, which implies that `result` must be defined somewhere in the code that is not provided here.
- Since `result` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, it is not possible to determine the exact value of `result` based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
Given that the variable `result` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine what will be printed. The output will depend on the value assigned to `result` in the rest of the code.

### Output:
Since `result` is not defined in the provided initial state, we cannot provide a precise value for it. However, based on the precondition, we can infer that the print statement will output the value of `result`.

Output: **result (where result is the value assigned to the variable `result` in the rest of the code)**
