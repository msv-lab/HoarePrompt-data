Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and the first tuple from the previous iteration has been removed; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` after all iterations and the newly appended `count` value; `freq` is a dictionary that contains the key `(rx, ry)`; `count` is 0; `arr` must have at least one element; `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`. The current value of `count` is not changed, and `(rx, ry)` is a key in the `freq` dictionary.**
