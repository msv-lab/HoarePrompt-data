The code snippet appends a new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are derived from the `data` list. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated, but other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `test_cases` initially contains two tuples, after the append operation, it will contain three tuples. The other variables `data`, `t`, and `idx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing three tuples `((n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element where `data[0]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0]) - 2` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is 5, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third integers from `data[5]` split by spaces, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[6]` split by spaces and converted to integers.**
