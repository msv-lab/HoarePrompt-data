The only variable in the loop head is `result`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If there are more elements in the `results` list, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `result` is the last element that was processed from the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the `results` list.

Since the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list, the next iteration will process the next element in the list. Therefore, `result` will be the next element in the `results` list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `idx` is `2 * t + 1`, and `results` is a list containing at least three elements**
