Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and the first tuple from the previous iteration has been removed; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` after all iterations and the newly appended `count` value; `freq` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, the value for the key `(rx, ry)` is incremented by 1 and `count` is updated to `count + freq[rx, ry]`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1; `arr` must have at least one element; `rx` is `(-arr[0] % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.**
