The code snippet updates the value of `current_pair` to a new tuple `(a % x, a % y)`, where `a` is the next element in `arr` that has not been processed yet. The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, `rx`, and `ry` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this particular line of code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and there is at least one more tuple to process with `arr` being a non-empty list; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `freq` is a dictionary; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`; `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `ry` is `a % y`; `a` is the next element in `arr` that has not been processed yet.**
