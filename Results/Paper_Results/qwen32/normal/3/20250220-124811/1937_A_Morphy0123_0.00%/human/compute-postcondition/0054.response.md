To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n_cases`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq n\_cases \leq 10^4\).
- `i`: Incremented by 1 from its previous value (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
- `n`: Remains unchanged (the value of `n` is not explicitly given, but it's an integer).
- `power`: The smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n - 1\).
- `power` is not equal to `n` (this condition is somewhat redundant since `power` is defined based on the inequality involving `n`).

### Analysis:
- The variable `power` is defined as the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n - 1\).
- Therefore, `2 ** power` will be the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of \(2^{\text{power}}\), which is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `power` or \(2^{\text{power}}\). However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **\(2^{\text{power}}\) (where \(\text{power}\) is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n - 1\))**
