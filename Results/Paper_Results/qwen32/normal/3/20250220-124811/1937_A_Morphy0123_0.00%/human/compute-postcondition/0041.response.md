The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about variables like `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print(1)` statement will output the integer `1`.
2. The variables `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` are mentioned in the initial state but are not referenced in the `print` statement. Thus, their values do not influence the output.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
