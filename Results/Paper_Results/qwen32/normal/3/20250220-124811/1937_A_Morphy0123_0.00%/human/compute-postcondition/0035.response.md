The value of `power` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`n_cases`, `i`, `n`, and the precondition that `power` is not equal to `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, starting from 0 for the first iteration; `n` is the integer value provided by the user input; `power` is `ceil(log2(n)) - 1`; `power` is not equal to `n`.**
