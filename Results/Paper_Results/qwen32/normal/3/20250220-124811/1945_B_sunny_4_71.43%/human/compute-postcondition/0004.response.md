Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `A` is an integer equal to `int(m / a) + 1`; `B` is an integer equal to `int(m / b) + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `B` has been updated to be an integer equal to `int(m / b) + 1`, while the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `A`) retain their initial values.
