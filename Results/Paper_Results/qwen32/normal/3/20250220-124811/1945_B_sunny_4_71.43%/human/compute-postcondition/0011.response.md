The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1` (where `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The values of `a`, `b`, `m`, `A`, and `B` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `A` is an integer equal to `int(m / a) + 1`; `B` is an integer equal to `int(m / b) + 1`**

However, to be more precise, if `t` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `x - 1`. So, if we denote the value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration as `x`, then:

State: **`t` is `x - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `A` is an integer equal to `int(m / a) + 1`; `B` is an integer equal to `int(m / b) + 1`**

But since we don't have a specific name for the previous value of `t`, we can simply state:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `A` is an integer equal to `int(m / a) + 1`; `B` is an integer equal to `int(m / b) + 1`**
