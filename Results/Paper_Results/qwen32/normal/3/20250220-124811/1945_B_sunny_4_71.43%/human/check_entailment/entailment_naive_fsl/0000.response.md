Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is flawed because it simply sums the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility duration `m` without considering the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Counting Fireworks Independently**:
   - The program calculates the number of fireworks `A` launched by the first installation within `m` minutes as `A = int(m / a) + 1`.
   - Similarly, it calculates the number of fireworks `B` launched by the second installation within `m` minutes as `B = int(m / b) + 1`.
   - It then prints the sum `A + B`.

2. **Ignoring Overlaps**:
   - The program does not account for the fact that fireworks from both installations can be visible at the same time. For example, if both installations launch a firework at the same time or if the visibility periods of fireworks from both installations overlap, the program counts these fireworks twice.

3. **Example of Incorrect Output**:
   - Consider the test case `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `m = 1`:
     - The first installation launches a firework at every minute: 0, 1, 2, ...
     - The second installation also launches a firework at every minute: 0, 1, 2, ...
     - Both fireworks launched at the same time will be visible for 1 minute.
     - The program calculates `A = int(1 / 1) + 1 = 2` and `B = int(1 / 1) + 1 = 2`, and prints `A + B = 4`.
     - However, since both fireworks launched at the same time are visible for 1 minute, the correct answer should be `2` (not `4`).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the number of distinct times within `m` minutes when fireworks from either installation are visible. This involves considering the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to handle overlaps correctly.

Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect for at least the test case mentioned and possibly others where overlaps occur. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
