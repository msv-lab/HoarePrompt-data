Output State: **`t` is 0; the loop has finished executing for all test cases; no further input values are read; the final outputs for all test cases have been printed.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all the iterations (as determined by the initial value of `t`), `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process. The loop will have stopped executing, and all the necessary outputs for each test case will have been printed to the console. No more input values will be read since the loop has completed all its iterations.
