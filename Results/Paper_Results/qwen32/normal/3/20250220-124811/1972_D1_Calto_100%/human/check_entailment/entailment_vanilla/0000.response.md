Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - It is correctly implemented and can be used to find the GCD of two numbers.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) for given `n` and `m`.
   - The implementation of `func_2` seems incorrect. Let's break down the logic:
     - `cnt` is initialized to -1, which is unusual for a counter.
     - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
     - For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
     - It then increments `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
   - The logic of this function does not match the problem's requirements. It is not correctly counting the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions specified in the problem.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the function `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in `func_2` does not align with the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
