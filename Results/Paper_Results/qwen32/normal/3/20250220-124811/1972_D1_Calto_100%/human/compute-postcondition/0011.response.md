The code snippet provided is `y = i * i`, which updates the value of `y` based on the current value of `i`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `cnt`, `x`, and `i`) are not directly affected by this statement and retain their previous values.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
- `cnt` is updated to `cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
- `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`.
- `y` is `i * i`.
- `i` is `i + 2`.

After executing `y = i * i`, the value of `y` will be the square of the updated `i` (which is `i + 2` from the previous state).

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is updated to `cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `(i + 2) * (i + 2)`; `i` is `i + 2`.**
