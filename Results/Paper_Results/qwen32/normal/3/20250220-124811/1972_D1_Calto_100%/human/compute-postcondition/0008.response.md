Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is updated to `cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`; `i` is `i + 1`**

In simple terms, the value of `cnt` has been updated by adding the ceiling of `x` divided by `y` and checking if `x` is exactly divisible by `y`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain as they were, except for the updated `cnt`.
