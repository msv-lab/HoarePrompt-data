The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that. According to the loop statement, `i` ranges from 1 to `m` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has some value, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still be less than or equal to `m`.

Let's break down the state changes:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value, say `k`.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `cnt`, `x`, `y`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k`, for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`. Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `m`, the next value of `i` must be `i + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil((n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) / ((i + 1) * (i + 1))) + ((n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) % ((i + 1) * (i + 1)) == 0); `x` is `n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))`; `y` is `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`; `i` is `i + 1`**
