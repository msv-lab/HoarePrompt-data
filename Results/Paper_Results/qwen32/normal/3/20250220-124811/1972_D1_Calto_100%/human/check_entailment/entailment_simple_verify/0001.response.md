### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
   - \(1 \le a \le n\)
   - \(1 \le b \le m\)
   - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Program Analysis**:
   The program includes two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

   - **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
     - This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
     - The annotations confirm that the function returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

   - **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
     - This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.
     - The implementation of `func_2` is suspicious and does not seem to correctly solve the problem.
     - The annotations indicate that `cnt` is updated based on a formula that involves `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, and then `cnt` is incremented by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
     - This formula does not directly correspond to the problem's requirement of checking whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Verification Using Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that `func_1` correctly computes the GCD.
   - The annotations for `func_2` show that the function is not correctly implementing the logic for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The function `func_2` does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a different formula that does not match the problem's requirements.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem as it does not properly count the pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
