### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's analyze the provided functions and their execution summaries to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - The implementation is correct and directly corresponds to the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD.
   - However, this function is not used anywhere in the provided code, so it seems extraneous for the given problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is the core of the solution and is supposed to compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.
   - The implementation involves a loop from 1 to `m` (inclusive), and for each `i`, it calculates `x` and `y` and updates the count `cnt`.
   - The formulas used inside the loop are:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
     - `y = i * i`
     - `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`
   - The variable `cnt` is initialized to -1, which seems incorrect because it should start from 0.
   - The logic inside the loop does not directly correspond to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Analysis of the Condition:

The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[ a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]
for some integer \(k\).

This implies:
\[ a = (k - 1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \]

Given that \(\gcd(a, b)\) divides both `a` and `b`, let \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then the condition becomes:
\[ d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = k \cdot d \cdot b' \]
\[ a' + b' = k \cdot b' \]
\[ a' = (k - 1) \cdot b' \]

This means \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\) scaled by \((k - 1)\). The provided function `func_2` does not seem to implement this logic correctly.

### Conclusion:

The provided function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given condition. Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
