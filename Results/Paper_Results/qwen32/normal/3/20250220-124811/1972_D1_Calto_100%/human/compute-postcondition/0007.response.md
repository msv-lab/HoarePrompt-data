The code snippet assigns a new value to `y`, which is `i * i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial state, `i` has been incremented by 1, so the new value of `y` will be the square of the incremented `i`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is -1 + math.ceil((n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) / ((i + 1) * (i + 1))) + ((n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) % ((i + 1) * (i + 1)) == 0); `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`; `i` is `i + 1`**
