To determine the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `cnt` variable based on the given `n` and `m`. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = m`, updating `cnt` in each iteration.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `cnt` starts at `-1`.
   - `n` and `m` are given and remain unchanged throughout the loop.

2. **Loop Iterations**:
   - For each iteration `i` from `1` to `m`:
     - `x` is calculated as `n - (i * i - i)`.
     - `y` is calculated as `i * i`.
     - `cnt` is updated as `cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop completes, `cnt` will have accumulated the sum of `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` for all `i` from `1` to `m`.

Given the format of the output state, we can express the final state as:

Output State: **`cnt` is updated to `-1 + sum(math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0) for i in range(1, m + 1))**.

In simpler terms, the final value of `cnt` is the initial value `-1` plus the sum of the ceiling of the division of `x` by `y` plus a boolean value indicating if `x` is divisible by `y` for each iteration from `1` to `m`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

So, the final output state is:

Output State: **`cnt` is updated to `-1 + sum(math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0) for i in range(1, m + 1))**.
