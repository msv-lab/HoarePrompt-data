You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `m`, and returns a count `cnt` which is calculated based on a summation involving the ceiling of a division and a condition check for each integer `i` from 1 to `m`. Specifically, for each `i`, it computes a value and accumulates it into `cnt`, which is then adjusted by subtracting 1 from the total sum.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - It is correctly implemented and can be used to find the GCD of two numbers.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) for given `n` and `m`.
   - The implementation of `func_2` seems incorrect. Let's break down the logic:
     - `cnt` is initialized to -1, which is unusual for a counter.
     - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
     - For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
     - It then increments `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
   - The logic of this function does not match the problem's requirements. It is not correctly counting the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions specified in the problem.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the function `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in `func_2` does not align with the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
