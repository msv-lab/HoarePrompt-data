Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` is the integer input by the user such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\).
- `y` is the integer value of `x // 2` such that \(1 \leq y \leq 500\).

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(y)
```

### Analysis:
- `x` is an input integer provided by the user, and it is constrained to be between 2 and 1000 inclusive.
- `y` is calculated as `x // 2`, which means it is the integer division of `x` by 2. This operation will always yield an integer result.
- The value of `y` will be exactly half of `x` if `x` is even, or the integer part of half of `x` if `x` is odd.

### Output Description:
Given the constraints, the value of `y` will always be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, as `x` ranges from 2 to 1000.

### Final Output:
Since the exact value of `x` (and consequently `y`) is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of how `y` is calculated.

Output: **y (where y is the integer value of x // 2 and 1 <= y <= 500)**
