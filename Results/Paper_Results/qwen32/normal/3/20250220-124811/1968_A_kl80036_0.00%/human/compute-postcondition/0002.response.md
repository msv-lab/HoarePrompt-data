The value of `y` is assigned the result of the integer division of `x` by 2. Given that `x` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= x <= 1000, the value of `y` will be an integer where `1 <= y <= 500`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is the integer input by the user such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is the integer value of `x // 2` such that 1 <= y <= 500.**
