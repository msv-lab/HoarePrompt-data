You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

    18

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is equal to `t`, and for each of the `t` test cases, `x` is the integer input by the user such that 2 <= x <= 1000, and `y` is the integer value of `x // 2` such that 1 <= y <= 500.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `x` and prints the integer division result of `x` by 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program always selects `y = x // 2` for each test case. While this approach might work for some values of `x`, it does not guarantee that `\gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized for all possible values of `x`.

Let's consider a few cases:

1. **For `x = 10`:**
   - The program outputs `y = 10 // 2 = 5`.
   - Checking: `\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10`.
   - This is correct for this case.

2. **For `x = 7`:**
   - The program outputs `y = 7 // 2 = 3`.
   - Checking: `\gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4`.
   - This is correct for this case.

3. **For `x = 21`:**
   - The program outputs `y = 21 // 2 = 10`.
   - Checking: `\gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11`.
   - However, a better choice would be `y = 18` because `\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21`, which is greater than 11.

4. **For `x = 100`:**
   - The program outputs `y = 100 // 2 = 50`.
   - Checking: `\gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100`.
   - This is correct for this case.

5. **For `x = 2`:**
   - The program outputs `y = 2 // 2 = 1`.
   - Checking: `\gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.
   - This is correct for this case.

6. **For `x = 1000`:**
   - The program outputs `y = 1000 // 2 = 500`.
   - Checking: `\gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 500 + 500 = 1000`.
   - This is correct for this case.

7. **For `x = 6`:**
   - The program outputs `y = 6 // 2 = 3`.
   - Checking: `\gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6`.
   - This is correct for this case.

However, the critical point is that the program does not guarantee the maximum value of `\gcd(x, y) + y` for all `x`. For example, with `x = 21`, the program outputs `y = 10`, but `y = 18` yields a higher value. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
