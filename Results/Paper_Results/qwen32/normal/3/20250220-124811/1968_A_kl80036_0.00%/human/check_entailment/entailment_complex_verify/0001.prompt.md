You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is equal to `t`, and for each of the `t` test cases, `x` is the integer input by the user such that 2 <= x <= 1000, and `y` is the integer value of `x // 2` such that 1 <= y <= 500.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `x` and prints the integer division result of `x` by 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The greatest common divisor (GCD) function, \(\gcd(a, b)\), returns the largest positive integer that divides both \( a \) and \( b \).

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer \( x \). It then calculates \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) (integer division) and prints this value.

### Checking the Program's Correctness

The program uses \( y = x // 2 \). Let's verify if this choice of \( y \) always maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

1. **For even \( x \):**
   - If \( x \) is even, then \( y = x // 2 \) is also even. 
   - \(\gcd(x, y)\) is at least 2 because both \( x \) and \( y \) are even.
   - The expression becomes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \geq 2 + \frac{x}{2} \).

2. **For odd \( x \):**
   - If \( x \) is odd, then \( y = x // 2 \) is even.
   - \(\gcd(x, y)\) is at least 1 because \( x \) is odd and \( y \) is even, and the highest common divisor in this case would be 1.
   - The expression becomes \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + \frac{x-1}{2} \).

However, this approach does not guarantee that \( y = x // 2 \) will always yield the maximum value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). We need to consider other values of \( y \) to ensure the maximum is found.

### Counterexamples

Let's consider a counterexample where \( x = 10 \):
- The program outputs \( y = 5 \).
- \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).

However, another possible \( y \) is 9:
- \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).

In this case, both 5 and 9 yield the same maximum value, so the program's output is correct for this input. But let's consider another case where \( x = 7 \):
- The program outputs \( y = 3 \).
- \(\gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4\).

However, another possible \( y \) is 6:
- \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\).

Here, \( y = 6 \) yields a higher value than \( y = 3 \), so the program's output is incorrect for this input.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not always find the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Reasoning: The program does not guarantee that the chosen \( y = x // 2 \) will always yield the maximum value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). There are cases where other values of \( y \) can result in a higher expression value.
Correctness: **False**
