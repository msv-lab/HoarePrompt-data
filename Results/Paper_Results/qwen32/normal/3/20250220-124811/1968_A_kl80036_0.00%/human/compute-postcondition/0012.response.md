Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is equal to `t`, and for each of the `t` test cases, `x` is the integer input by the user such that 2 <= x <= 1000, and `y` is the integer value of `x // 2` such that 1 <= y <= 500.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop are complete, `t` remains the same integer between 1 and 1000. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. For each test case, `x` will be an integer input by the user within the range of 2 to 1000, and `y` will be the integer result of `x` divided by 2 (using integer division), which will be between 1 and 500.
