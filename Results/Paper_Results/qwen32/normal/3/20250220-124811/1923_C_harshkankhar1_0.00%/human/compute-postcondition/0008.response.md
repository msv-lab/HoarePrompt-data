The code snippet `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x` updates the value of `b[i]` based on the previous value `b[i - 1]` and the value of `x`. Here, `x` is determined by the condition `a[i] > 1`. If `a[i] > 1`, `x` is 1; otherwise, `x` is 2. The value of `b[i]` is thus the sum of `b[i - 1]` and `x`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x`.**
