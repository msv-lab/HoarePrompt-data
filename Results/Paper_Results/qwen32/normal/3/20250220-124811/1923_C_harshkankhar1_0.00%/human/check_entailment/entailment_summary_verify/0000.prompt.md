You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of integers and a series of queries. Each query specifies a range within the list. The function calculates and prints the cumulative sum of the list elements up to each index. Then, for each query, it checks if the sum of the elements in the specified range is at least as large as the count of elements greater than 1 in that range, excluding the case where the range consists of a single element, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is good according to the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `b` Array:**
   - The `b` array is supposed to ensure that each element `b_i` is greater than 0 and different from `a_i`. The logic used in the code is incorrect as it simply assigns `b[i]` to be `b[i-1] + x`, where `x` is either 1 or 2 based on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not. This does not guarantee that `b_i` is different from `a_i` and also does not ensure that the sum of `b` is equal to the sum of the corresponding subarray of `a`.

2. **Incorrect Condition for "Good" Subarray:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the subarray `a[y] - a[x-1]` is less than `b[y] - b[x-1]` or if `x == y`, and prints "NO" if the condition is true. However, this condition is not correctly derived from the problem requirements. The program should check if there exists a `b` array that satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the problem description.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The subarray is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- We can construct `b` as `[2, 3, 4]` which satisfies:
  1. `sum(a) = sum(b) = 6`
  2. `a_i != b_i` for all `i`
  3. `b_i > 0` for all `i`

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
NO
```

This is because the program's logic for constructing `b` and checking the conditions is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
