### Reasoning

Let's evaluate the program step-by-step based on the problem description and the function summary provided. We will check if the logic in the program correctly determines if a subarray is "good" according to the conditions specified.

#### Problem Recap:
A subarray is considered "good" if:
1. The sum of the subarray is equal to the sum of another array `b` of the same length.
2. Each element in the subarray is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The input array `c` is read and stored in `a` with an extra `0` at the beginning to facilitate prefix sum calculations.
   - An array `b` of the same length as `a` is initialized with `0`s.

2. **Constructing `b`**:
   - For each element `a[i]` in `a` (starting from index `1`), the program sets `b[i]` to `b[i-1] + x`, where `x` is `1` if `a[i] > 1` and `2` otherwise.
   - This method does not ensure that the sum of any subarray of `b` will be equal to the sum of the corresponding subarray in `a`. It also does not ensure that each element in `b` will be different from the corresponding element in `a`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of `a` and stores them back in `a`.

4. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` using the prefix sums stored in `a`.
   - It also calculates the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b` using the prefix sums stored in `b`.
   - It then checks if the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b` or if `l_i == r_i`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Construction of `b`**:
   - The construction of `b` does not ensure that the sum of `b[l_i:r_i+1]` will be equal to the sum of `c[l_i:r_i+1]` for any subarray.
   - The construction also does not ensure that each element in `b[l_i:r_i+1]` will be different from the corresponding element in `c[l_i:r_i+1]`.

2. **Insufficient Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b` or if `l_i == r_i`. However, this check is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is good.
   - The program does not ensure that every element in `b[l_i:r_i+1]` is greater than `0` and different from the corresponding element in `c[l_i:r_i+1]`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Final: **False**
