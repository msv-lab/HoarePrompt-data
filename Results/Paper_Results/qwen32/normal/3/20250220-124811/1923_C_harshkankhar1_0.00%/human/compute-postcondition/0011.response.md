The code snippet updates the value of `b[i]` based on the previous value `b[i - 1]` and the value of `x`. The value of `x` is determined by the condition `a[i] > 1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than `i`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else `x` is 2

The code `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x` updates `b[i]` to be the sum of `b[i - 1]` and `x`. The other variables (`n`, `a[i]`, `b[i - 1]`, and `x`) are not changed by this code snippet, except for `i` which is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else `x` is 2, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x`.**
