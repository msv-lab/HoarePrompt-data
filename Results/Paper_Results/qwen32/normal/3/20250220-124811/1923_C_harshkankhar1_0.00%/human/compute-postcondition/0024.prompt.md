Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a list where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is the cumulative sum of `x` values determined by the condition `a[i] > 1`; `a` is a list of cumulative sums of its original elements.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES'
        )


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is a list where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is the cumulative sum of `x` values determined by the condition `a[i] > 1`; `a` is a list of cumulative sums of its original elements; `q` must be greater than 0; `x` and `y` are the integers read from the input. The program has printed 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise it has printed 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a list where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is the cumulative sum of `x` values determined by the condition `a[i] > 1`; `a` is a list of cumulative sums of its original elements; `q` must be greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `x` and `y` are the integers read from the input. The program has printed 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise it has printed 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is a list where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is the cumulative sum of `x` values determined by the condition `a[i] > 1`; `a` is a list of cumulative sums of its original elements; `q` is greater than 1 and is decremented by 1; `x` and `y` are the integers read from the input; the output is 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise the output is 'YES'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
