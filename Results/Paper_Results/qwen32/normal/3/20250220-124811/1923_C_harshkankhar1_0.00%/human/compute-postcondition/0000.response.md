The code snippet reads two integers from the input, which are assigned to the variables `n` and `q`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range and that `n` and `q` are integers with specific constraints. After the execution of the code snippet, the value of `n` and `q` will be set to the input values, while `t` and the list `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
