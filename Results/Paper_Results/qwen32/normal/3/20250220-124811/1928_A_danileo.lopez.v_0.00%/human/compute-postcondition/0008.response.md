The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program. The loop iterates `t` times, and the loop variable `_` is incremented automatically by the `range` function. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` itself, as it determines whether the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1. Since the loop has just completed an iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the number of remaining iterations.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` and `b` are the integers provided in the input. At least one of `a` or `b` is even, or both `a` and `b` are odd integers.**
