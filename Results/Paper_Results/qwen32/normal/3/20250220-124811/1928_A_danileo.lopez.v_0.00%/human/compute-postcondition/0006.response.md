Let's break down the given information and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` and `b` are the integers provided in the input, and both `a` and `b` are odd integers.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet simply prints the string `'No'`. There are no variables or conditions in the code that affect the output of this print statement. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` do not influence the output of this specific print statement because the string `'No'` is hardcoded.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
