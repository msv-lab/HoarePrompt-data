The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes an input line, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, and `a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle. After executing the code, the values of `a` and `b` will be updated to the integers provided in the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are the integers provided in the input**.
