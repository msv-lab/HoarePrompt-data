The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer input that must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. The variables `a` and `b` are integers provided in the input, with the condition that at least one of them is even, or both are odd.
3. The `print` statement is `print('Yes')`, which directly outputs the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any variables, the output will always be the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
