Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are the integers provided in the input. At least one of `a` or `b` is even, or both `a` and `b` are odd integers. The condition `a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0` is evaluated, but the values of `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition is true or false.**
