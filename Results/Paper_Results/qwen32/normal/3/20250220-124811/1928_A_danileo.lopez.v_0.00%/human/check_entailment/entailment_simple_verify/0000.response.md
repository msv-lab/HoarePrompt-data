Let's reason through the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis
Bob can cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles and then try to form a different rectangle from these two pieces. The critical point is whether he can form a different rectangle, considering that rotations of the same rectangle are not considered different.

### Key Observations
1. **Even Dimension Case**:
    - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
    - For example, if \(a\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \(a/2 \times b\) rectangles and form a \(a \times b/2\) rectangle.
    - Similarly, if \(b\) is even, he can cut the rectangle into two \(a \times b/2\) rectangles and form a \(a/2 \times b\) rectangle.

2. **Odd Dimension Case**:
    - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, any cut will result in two smaller rectangles with at least one odd dimension. These smaller rectangles cannot be combined to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
    - For example, a \(3 \times 3\) rectangle can only be cut into \(3 \times 1\) and \(3 \times 2\) rectangles, which cannot be rearranged to form a different \(3 \times 3\) rectangle.

### Program Analysis
The provided program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even:
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, it prints "Yes".
- If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints "No".

### Annotations
The annotations confirm that the program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints "Yes" if at least one dimension is even and "No" if both dimensions are odd.

### Validation of the Original Assessment
The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and reasoning behind the program. It accurately explains why the program works for all cases, including edge cases where \(a\) or \(b\) is 1. The logic aligns with the problem description and correctly handles the conditions outlined.

### Conclusion
Based on the problem analysis, program analysis, and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
