### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

**Problem Analysis:**
The problem states that Bob can cut a rectangle of size \( a \times b \) into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. Then, he tries to form another rectangle from these two smaller rectangles. The key point here is that if at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle is even, Bob can always form a different rectangle. Here's why:

1. **Even Dimension Case:**
   - If \( a \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a \( \frac{a}{2} \times 2b \) rectangle.
   - If \( b \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles. These two rectangles can be rearranged to form a \( a \times 2\frac{b}{2} \) rectangle.
   - In both cases, the resulting rectangle will have different dimensions from the original rectangle (considering that \( a \times b \) and \( b \times a \) are the same).

2. **Odd Dimension Case:**
   - If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, the rectangle can only be cut into two rectangles with one dimension being 1 (since the cut must be parallel to one of the sides). For example, a \( 3 \times 5 \) rectangle can be cut into two \( 3 \times 2 \) and \( 3 \times 3 \) rectangles, but these cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle with integer sides.

**Program Analysis:**
The provided program checks if at least one of the dimensions \( a \) or \( b \) is even. If so, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Bob can form a different rectangle. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

**Conclusion:**
The logic implemented in the program is correct. If at least one of the dimensions is even, Bob can form a different rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, he cannot form a different rectangle. Therefore, the program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle or not.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
