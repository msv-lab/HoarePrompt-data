### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting an original rectangle of size `a x b` into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The key insight is that if at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle is even, it is always possible to form a different rectangle. This is because:

- If `a` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two `a/2 x b` rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a `b x a` rectangle.
- If `b` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two `a x b/2` rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a `a x b` rectangle (which is the same as `b x a` when considering rotations).

Conversely, if both `a` and `b` are odd, the rectangle can only be cut into smaller rectangles with at least one odd dimension, and these smaller rectangles cannot be rearranged to form a rectangle different from the original `a x b` rectangle.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if at least one of the dimensions (`a` or `b`) is even. If so, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". This matches the problem's requirements.
