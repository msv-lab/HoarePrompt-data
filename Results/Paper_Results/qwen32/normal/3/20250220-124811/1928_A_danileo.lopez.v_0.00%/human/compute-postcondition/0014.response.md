The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, and that `a` and `b` are integers where at least one of them is even, or both are odd.

The code snippet does not affect `t` and updates the values of `a` and `b` based on the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are the integers provided in the input. At least one of `a` or `b` is even, or both `a` and `b` are odd integers.** The values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the new integers provided in the input.
