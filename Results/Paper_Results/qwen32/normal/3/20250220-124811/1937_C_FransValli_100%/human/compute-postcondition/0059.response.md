To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the variables and their values based on the provided initial state:

1. **t**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. This variable does not directly affect the print statement.
2. **n**: An input integer. This variable also does not directly affect the print statement.
3. **maxi**: The largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given. This variable is not directly used in the print statement.
4. **arr**: A list with at least two elements. The exact elements are not specified.
5. **mini**: This variable is updated based on the previous `res` and `item`. The exact value is not specified, but it is used in the print statement.
6. **item**: The next element in `arr` after the current `item`. The exact value is not specified, but it is used in the print statement.
7. **res**: The user's input. This variable is not directly used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The string `'?'` is a constant and will be printed as is.
- `mini` is printed twice. Since the exact value of `mini` is not specified, we can only describe it as the current value of `mini`.
- `item` is printed twice. Since the exact value of `item` is not specified, we can only describe it as the current value of `item`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be a string starting with `'?'`, followed by the value of `mini` printed twice, and then the value of `item` printed twice.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the current value of mini and [item] is the current value of item)**
