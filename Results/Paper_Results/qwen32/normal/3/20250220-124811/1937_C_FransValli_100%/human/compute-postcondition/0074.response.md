The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is greater than 1
- If `res` is `'<'`, then `maxi` is set to `i`
- `arr` contains all values of `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and if `maxi` is not 0, `arr` also includes `maxi` as its last element
- `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists
- `res` is the user's input

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, say `i = k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `k + 1` and `n` should remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is the user's input, `arr` contains all values of `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and if `maxi` is not 0, `arr` also includes `maxi` as its last element, `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `i` is `k + 1`** (where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration)
