The code snippet provided is:
```
n = int(input())
```
This line of code will take an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `n` is not relevant since it is being reassigned. The other variables (`t`, `maxi`, `arr`, `mini`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `n` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `n` is the new input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and is reset to `[i]` if the user's input was `'<'`; `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found; `i` is `n-1`.**
