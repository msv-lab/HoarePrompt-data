The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `p`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^3. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `p` is a permutation of the integers from 0 to n-1. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
