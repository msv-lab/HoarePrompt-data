Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is the previous `arr` with `i` appended. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged, and `res` is the new input string.**
