The code assigns the value of the first element of the list `arr` to the variable `mini`. The values of `t`, `n`, `maxi`, and the contents of `arr` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `mini`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given; `arr` contains all values of `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and if `maxi` is not `0`, `arr` also includes `maxi` as its last element; `mini` is the first element of `arr`.**
