The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged. The value of `i` was incremented by 1 before this operation, so `i` now holds the value it had before plus one. The list `arr` will now include this new value of `i` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `res` is an input string, `arr` includes the new value of `i` appended to it.**
