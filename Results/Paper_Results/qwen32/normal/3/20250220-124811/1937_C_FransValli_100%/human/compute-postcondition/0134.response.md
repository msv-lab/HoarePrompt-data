Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 1.
3. **`maxi`**: Initialized to 0.
4. **`arr`**: A list that contains indices `i` for which the user's input was `'='`. It is reset to `[i]` if the user's input was `'<'`.
5. **`mini`**: The last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found.
6. **`i`**: Set to `n-1`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- **`maxi`**: This variable is explicitly initialized to 0. There is no information provided that suggests it changes before the print statement, so `maxi` remains 0.
- **`i`**: This variable is set to `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `i` will be at least 0 and at most 999 (if `n` is 1000).
- **`flush=True`**: This parameter ensures that the output is immediately written to the console, but it does not affect the content of the output.

### What Will Be Printed:
The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the value of `maxi` twice, and the value of `i` twice. Given the initial state, `maxi` is 0 and `i` is `n-1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 0 [n-1] [n-1] (where n is an integer greater than 1)**
