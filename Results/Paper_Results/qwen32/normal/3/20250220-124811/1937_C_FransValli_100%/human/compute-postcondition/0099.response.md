The code snippet `arr = [i]` changes the value of `arr` to a new list containing only the current value of `i`. No other variables are affected by this code.

Given the initial state, `i` is 1. Therefore, `arr` will be updated to `[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is `n-1` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise it is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received; `arr` is `[1]`; `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists; `i` is 1; `res` is the user's new input.**
