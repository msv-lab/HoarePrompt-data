To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 1. This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
3. **`res`**: The user's input. This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
4. **`arr`**: Contains all values of `i` for which the user's input was `'='`. If `maxi` is not 0, `arr` also includes `maxi` as its last element.
5. **`maxi`**: Not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it seems to be a value that, if not 0, is added to `arr` as its last element. Since `maxi` is not 0 in this context, it is included in `arr`.
6. **`mini`**: The largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
7. **`i`**: Defined as `k + 1`. The value of `k` is not provided, but `i` is used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `maxi` is a value that is included in `arr` if it is not 0.
- `i` is defined as `k + 1`, where `k` is not provided but is used in the print statement.

Since the exact values of `maxi` and `i` are not explicitly provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] (where maxi is a value included in arr if it is not 0, and i is defined as k + 1)**
