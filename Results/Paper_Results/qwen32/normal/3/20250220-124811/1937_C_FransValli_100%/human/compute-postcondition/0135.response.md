Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `n` must be greater than 1; `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains all indices `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and is reset to `[i]` if the user's input was `'<'`; `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found; `i` is `n-1`; `res` is the value of the user's input.**

Explanation: The user's input is stored in the variable `res`, and all other variables retain their initial values.
