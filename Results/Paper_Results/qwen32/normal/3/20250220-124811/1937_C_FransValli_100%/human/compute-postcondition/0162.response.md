Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given.
- `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `res` is the user input.
  - If `res` equals `'<'`, `arr` is updated to `[n-1]`.
  - If `res` is not `'<'`, `arr` is `[0, n-1]` if `res` equals `'='`, otherwise `arr` remains `[0]`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`maxi`**: This is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`. If no such response was given, `maxi` is 0.
2. **`arr[0]`**: This is the first element of the list `arr`.
   - If `res` equals `'<'`, `arr` is updated to `[n-1]`, so `arr[0]` will be `n-1`.
   - If `res` equals `'='`, `arr` is updated to `[0, n-1]`, so `arr[0]` will be `0`.
   - If `res` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `arr` remains `[0]`, so `arr[0]` will be `0`.
3. **`i`**: This is `n-1`.

### Output:
The print statement will output:
- A literal `'?'`.
- The value of `maxi`.
- The value of `arr[0]`, which depends on the value of `res`.
- The value of `maxi` again.
- The value of `i`, which is `n-1`.

### Conclusion:
- If `res` equals `'<'`, `arr[0]` is `n-1`.
- If `res` equals `'='`, `arr[0]` is `0`.
- If `res` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `arr[0]` is `0`.

Given these conditions, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [n-1] (where maxi is the largest index for which the response was '<' or 0 if no such response was given, arr[0] is n-1 if res is '<', 0 if res is '=', and 0 otherwise, and n-1 is the value of i)**
