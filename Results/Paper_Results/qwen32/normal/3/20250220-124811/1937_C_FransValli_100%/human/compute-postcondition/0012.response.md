The code assigns the value of `i` to `maxi`. The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. Since `i` is described as `i + 1` in the initial state, we can infer that `i` has already been incremented before this line of code is executed. Therefore, `maxi` will now hold the value of `i` after its increment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is greater than 1; `res` is the user's new input; `i` is `i + 1`; `maxi` is `i + 1`**.
