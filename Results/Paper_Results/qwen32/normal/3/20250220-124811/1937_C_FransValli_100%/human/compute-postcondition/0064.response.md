Let's break down the given initial state and understand the values of the variables `maxi`, `mini`, and `arr`:

1. **`t`**: This is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). However, `t` does not directly influence the values of `maxi`, `mini`, or `arr` in the context of the `print` statement.

2. **`n`**: This is an input integer. The value of `n` determines the range of `i` from 1 to \(n-1\) for which user inputs are given.

3. **`maxi`**: This is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to \(n-1\)) for which the user's input was `'<'`. If no such input was given, `maxi` is 0.

4. **`arr`**: This list contains all values of `i` for which the user's input was `'='`. Additionally, if `maxi` is not 0, `arr` also includes `maxi` as its last element.

5. **`mini`**: This is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`. If no such element exists, `mini` is the first element of `arr`.

Given these definitions, let's analyze what will be printed:

- The `print` statement will output the values of `maxi` and `mini` along with an exclamation mark.
- `maxi` is determined based on the user's inputs of `'<'`.
- `mini` is determined based on the user's inputs of `'>'` and the elements in `arr`.

Since the exact user inputs are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `maxi` and `mini`. However, we can describe them based on the given conditions.

### Explanation:
- `maxi` is the largest index `i` where the user input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was given.
- `arr` contains indices `i` where the user input was `'='`, and if `maxi` is not 0, it also contains `maxi`.
- `mini` is the largest element in `arr` where the user input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.

Given this information, the output will be:

Output: **! maxi mini (where maxi is the largest index i for which the user input was '<', or 0 if no such input was given, and mini is the largest element in arr for which the user input was '>', or the first element of arr if no such element exists)**
