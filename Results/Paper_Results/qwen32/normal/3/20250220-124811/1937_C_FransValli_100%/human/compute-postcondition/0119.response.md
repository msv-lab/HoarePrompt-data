Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it doesn't directly affect the current print statement.
2. **`n`**: An input integer. This likely represents the number of elements in the array `arr`.
3. **`maxi`**: The largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received. This variable is not directly used in the print statement.
4. **`arr`**: A list containing at least two elements.
5. **`mini`**: 
   - If `res` equals `'>'`, `mini` is set to `item`.
   - Otherwise, `mini` remains the first element of `arr`.
6. **`i`**: Set to `n-1`. This variable represents the index of the last element in the array `arr`.
7. **`res`**: The user's input, which is either `'<'` or `'>'`.
8. **`item`**: The next element in `arr[1:]`. Since `i` is `n-1`, `item` is the second-to-last element in `arr` (if `n > 2`), or the first element in `arr[1:]` (if `n = 2`).

### Print Statement Analysis

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mini` is either the first element of `arr` or `item` (the second-to-last element of `arr` if `res` is `'>'`).
- `item` is the second-to-last element of `arr` if `n > 2`, or the first element in `arr[1:]` if `n = 2`.

### Output Derivation

To determine the exact output, we need to consider two main scenarios based on the value of `res`:

1. **If `res` is `'<'`**:
   - `mini` remains the first element of `arr`.
   - `item` is the second-to-last element of `arr` (if `n > 2`), or the first element in `arr[1:]` (if `n = 2`).

2. **If `res` is `'>'`**:
   - `mini` is set to `item` (the second-to-last element of `arr` if `n > 2`, or the first element in `arr[1:]` if `n = 2`).
   - `item` is the same as `mini` in this case.

### Conclusion

Given the above scenarios, the print statement will output:
- `'?'`, followed by `mini` twice, followed by `item` twice.

The exact values of `mini` and `item` depend on the input values of `arr` and `res`.

Output: **'? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]' (where [mini] is the first element of arr if res is '<', or the second-to-last element of arr if res is '>', and [item] is the second-to-last element of arr)**
