Let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Given Information:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (This means `i` has been incremented at some point in the code, but its initial value is not specified. However, it is known to be incremented by 1 at this point.)

2. **Python Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

### Variables and Their Values:
- `maxi`: The value of `maxi` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. It could be the maximum value of some list or array, but without more context, we can only say it is `maxi`.
- `arr`: The value of `arr[0]` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. It could be any value from the list `arr`, but without more context, we can only say it is `arr[0]`.
- `i`: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but its initial value is not provided. Therefore, its current value can be described as `i (after increment)`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will output a string starting with `'?'`, followed by the value of `maxi`, then the value of `arr[0]`, then the value of `maxi` again, and finally the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i (after increment)] (where maxi is the maximum value of some list or array, arr[0] is the first element of the array arr, and i is the value of i after being incremented by 1)**

To make it more precise and adhering to the format:
Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i + 1] (where maxi is the maximum value of some list or array, arr[0] is the first element of the array arr, and i is the value of i before incrementing)**
