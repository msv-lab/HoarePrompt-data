Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given, `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found, `i` is `n-1`, and `res` is the user input. If `res` equals `'<'`, `arr` is updated to `[n-1]`. If `res` is not `'<'`, `arr` is `[0, n-1]` if `res` equals `'='`, otherwise `arr` remains `[0]`.

The code snippet:
```
res = input()
```

This line of code updates the variable `res` with the user input. No other variables are affected directly by this line of code. The new value of `res` will determine the subsequent actions in the program.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given, `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found, `i` is `n-1`, and `res` is the user input.**

In natural language: The value of `res` is updated to whatever the user inputs. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `mini`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
