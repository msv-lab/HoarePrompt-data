The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` was `[0]`. After appending `i`, `arr` becomes `[0, i]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `maxi`, `res`, and the condition `res` being equal to `'='` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is `[0, i]`, `res` is an input string, and `res` is equal to `'='`**
