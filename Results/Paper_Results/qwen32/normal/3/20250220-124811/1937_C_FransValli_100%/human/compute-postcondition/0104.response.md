To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the values of the variables involved:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `maxi` is `n-1` if `res` is `'<'`, otherwise it is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.
   - `arr` is `[1]` if `res` is `'<'`, or `[0, i]` if `res` is not equal to `'='`, and `[0, n-1, i]` if `res` is `'='`.
   - `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `res` is the user's new input.

2. **Variables and their Values**:
   - `maxi`: This value depends on the user's previous input (`res`). If `res` was `'<'`, `maxi` is `n-1`. Otherwise, it is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received. Since we don't know the exact previous input, we can't determine `maxi` precisely, but we can describe it based on the conditions.
   - `arr`: The value of `arr` also depends on the user's previous input (`res`). If `res` was `'<'`, `arr` is `[1]`. If `res` was not `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]`. If `res` was `'='`, `arr` is `[0, n-1, i]`.
   - `i`: This is explicitly given as 2.
   - `res`: This is the user's new input, and its exact value is not provided.

For the `print` statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```
Let's break down the values being printed:
- `'?'`: This is a literal string.
- `maxi`: This value depends on the user's previous input. If `res` was `'<'`, `maxi` is `n-1`. Otherwise, it is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.
- `arr[0]`: This value depends on the user's previous input. If `res` was `'<'`, `arr` is `[1]`, so `arr[0]` is 1. If `res` was not `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]`, so `arr[0]` is 0. If `res` was `'='`, `arr` is `[0, n-1, i]`, so `arr[0]` is 0.
- `maxi`: This is the same as the second value being printed.
- `i`: This is explicitly given as 2.

Given the above, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 2 (where maxi is n-1 if the previous res was '<', otherwise it is the largest value of i for which the user's input was '<', or 0 if no such input was received; arr[0] is 1 if the previous res was '<', otherwise it is 0)**
