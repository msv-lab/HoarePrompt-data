Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given, `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found, `i` is `n-1`, and `res` is the user input. If `res` equals `'<'`, `arr` is updated to `[n-1]`. If `res` is not `'<'`, `arr` is `[0, n-1]` if `res` equals `'='`, otherwise `arr` remains `[0]`.**
