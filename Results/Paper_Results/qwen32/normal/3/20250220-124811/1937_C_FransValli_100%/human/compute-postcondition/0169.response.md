Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given.
- `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found.
- `i` is 1.
- `res` is the user input. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[n-1]`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` has `n-1` appended to it.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'?'`**: This is a literal string and will be printed as is.
2. **`maxi`**: This is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given. Since no specific value for `maxi` is provided in the initial state, we can only say that it is either 0 or some positive integer based on the responses received.
3. **`arr[0]`**: The value of `arr[0]` depends on the user input `res`:
   - If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is initialized as `[n-1]`, so `arr[0]` will be `n-1`.
   - If `res` is `'='`, `arr` has `n-1` appended to it, but since we are only concerned with `arr[0]` and it is not modified by the appending operation, `arr[0]` will still be `n-1` (assuming `arr` was initially `[n-1]` or was empty and then `[n-1]` was added).
4. **`maxi`**: This is repeated from point 2.
5. **`i`**: This is explicitly given as 1 in the initial state.

### Output:
Based on the above analysis, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` as the first character.
- `maxi` as the second value, which is either 0 or some positive integer.
- `arr[0]` as the third value, which is `n-1`.
- `maxi` as the fourth value, which is the same as the second value.
- `i` as the fifth value, which is 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [maxi] [n-1] [maxi] 1 (where maxi is either 0 or the largest index i for which the response was '<', and n is greater than 1)**
