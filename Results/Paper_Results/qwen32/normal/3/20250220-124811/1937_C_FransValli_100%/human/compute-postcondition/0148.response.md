Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `n` is greater than 1; if `res` is `'<'`, then `maxi` is updated to `n` and `arr` is reset to `[i]`, otherwise `maxi` remains unchanged; `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found; `i` is `n`; `res` is the value of the user's input.**
