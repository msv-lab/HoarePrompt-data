The code snippet `arr.append(i)` modifies the list `arr` by adding the value of `i` to it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, and `res`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is greater than 1
- `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given
- `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` is `[0]`
- `res` is the new input string

After executing `arr.append(i)`, the list `arr` will have `i` appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given, `arr` is the previous `arr` with `i` appended, and `res` is the new input string.**
