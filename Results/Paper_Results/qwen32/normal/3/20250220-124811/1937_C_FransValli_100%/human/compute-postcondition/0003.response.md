To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `n` in this case.

The `for` loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range `(1, n)` is not empty. This means that `n` must be greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` will generate numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

The variables `t` and `maxi` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the above, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` must be greater than 1; `maxi` is 0**
