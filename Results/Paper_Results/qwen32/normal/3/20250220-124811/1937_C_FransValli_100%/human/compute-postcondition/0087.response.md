Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `maxi` is the largest value of `i` for which the user's input was `'<'`, or 0 if no such input was received.
- `arr` is `[0]`.
- `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.
- `i` is `n-1`.

### Analysis
- Since `arr` is initialized as `[0]`, `arr[0]` is `0`.
- `maxi` is initialized to `0` because no user input has been received yet (or the user's input did not contain any `'<'`).
- `mini` is the first element of `arr`, which is `0`, because no user input with `'>'` has been received.
- `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is greater than 1. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified, so `i` is simply `n-1`.

### Print Statement
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Substituting Values
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `maxi` is `0`.
- `arr[0]` is `0`.
- `maxi` is `0`.
- `i` is `n-1`.

### Output
The output will be:
```
? 0 0 0 n-1
```

### Final Answer
Output: **? 0 0 0 n-1**
