Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's input was `'<'`, or `0` if no such input was given.
- `arr` is a list with at least two elements.
- `mini` is the first element of `arr`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `mini` is explicitly stated to be the first element of the list `arr`. Therefore, `mini` will be the value of `arr[0]`.
- The variable `item` is not defined in the initial state. This means that `item` is not provided any value in the given context. Therefore, we can't determine the exact value of `item` from the given information.

Since `item` is not defined, we can't provide a specific value for it. However, we can still describe the output in terms of the known values and the undefined variable.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the value of `mini` twice and the value of `item` twice. Since `mini` is the first element of `arr`, it will be `arr[0]`. The value of `item` is unknown and thus will be represented as `item`.

Output: **? [arr[0]] [arr[0]] item item (where arr[0] is the first element of the list arr and item is an undefined variable)**

To strictly adhere to the format specified:

Output: **? [arr[0]] [arr[0]] item item (where arr[0] is the first element of the list arr and item is an undefined variable)**
