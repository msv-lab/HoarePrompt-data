The code snippet assigns the result of `input()` to the variable `res`. This means that `res` will hold the value of whatever the user inputs. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `maxi`, `arr`, and `mini`) remain unchanged by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` must be greater than 1; `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains all values of `i` for which the user's input was `'='`, and if `maxi` is not 0, `arr` also includes `maxi` as its last element; `mini` is the largest element in `arr` for which the user's input was `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists; `res` is the user's input.**
