The code snippet `arr = [i]` sets the list `arr` to contain only the value of `i`, which is `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `maxi` is the largest index `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or 0 if no such response was given, `arr` is `[n-1]`, `mini` is the last element in `arr` that caused the response `'>'`, or the first element of `arr` if no such element was found, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the user input and `res` equals `'<'`.**
