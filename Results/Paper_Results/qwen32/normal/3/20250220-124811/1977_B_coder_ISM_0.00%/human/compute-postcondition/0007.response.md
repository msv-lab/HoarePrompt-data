The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. This modifies the list `s`, which was initially empty. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `length`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing the string `'1'`; `length` is 30; `i` is a non-negative integer; the `i`-th bit of `x` is set (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is true)**.
