Postcondition: **The list `s` will have no consecutive '1's, and any '0' that was encountered when `flag` was 1 will be replaced by '1'. `length` remains 30. `t` remains unchanged. `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 30 * 29. `flag` is 1, and the last element `s[29]` is '0'.**
