The code snippet appends the string '1' to the list `s`. The values of `t`, `x`, `length`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `s` now contains an additional '1'.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either ['1', '1'] or ['0', '1'] depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not; `length` is 30; `i` is `i + 1`**
