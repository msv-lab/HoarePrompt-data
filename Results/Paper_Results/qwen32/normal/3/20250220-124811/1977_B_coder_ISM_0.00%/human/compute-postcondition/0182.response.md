The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string '1' to the list `s`. The values of `length`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `s` now has an additional element '1' appended to it.

Output State: **`length` is 30, `x` is an integer, `i` is 5, `s` has a new element '1' appended to it.**
