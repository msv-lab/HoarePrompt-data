Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- The string `s` has all `'1'`s shifted to the left of all `'-1'`s, with no `'1'`s directly followed by `'-1'`s. This means `s` could look something like `"11111-1-1-1..."`.
- The value of `length` is not directly relevant to the print statement since it's not used in the print statement. However, it's mentioned that `length` might be incremented by 1 and `'1'` appended to `s` if `flag` is `True` and the 30th character of `s` is not `'1'`.
- The variable `t` is mentioned as remaining unchanged, but it is not used in the print statement.

### Print Statement:
- The statement `print(*s)` will print each character of the string `s` separated by spaces.

### Analysis:
- Since `s` has all `'1'`s on the left and all `'-1'`s on the right, and there are no `'1'`s directly followed by `'-1'`s, the print statement will output each character of `s` separated by spaces.
- The exact characters and their order are determined by the initial state of `s`. However, we do not have the exact string `s` provided, but we know its structure.

### Final Output:
Given the structure of `s`, the output will be a series of `'1'`s followed by `'-1'`s, each separated by a space.

Output: **1 1 1 1 1 ... -1 -1 -1 ... (where the exact number of '1's and '-1's and their distribution are determined by the initial state of s)**
