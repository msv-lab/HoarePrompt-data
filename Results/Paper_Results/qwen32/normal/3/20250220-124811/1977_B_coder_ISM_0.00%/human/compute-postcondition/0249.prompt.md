Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    print(*s)
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The string `s` will have all `'1'`s shifted to the left of all `'-1'`s, with no `'1'`s directly followed by `'-1'`s. The value of `length` remains unchanged unless `flag` was `True` and the 30th character of `s` was not `'1'`, in which case `length` is incremented by 1 and `'1'` is appended to `s`. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `s` remains unchanged, `length` is 30 or 31, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 30 * 29 if `flag` was 1 and `s[29]` was '0', plus 870 if `flag` was 1 and `s[29]` was not '0', or plus 30 * 29 if `flag` was 0, and `flag` remains 1 or 0 depending on the conditions described.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `length` is either 30 or 31, `x` is the input integer, `i` is `length - 1`, `s` is a list of characters representing the transformed binary form of `x` with no consecutive '1's and all `'-1'`s replaced by `'0'`s, and `flag` is either 0 or 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
