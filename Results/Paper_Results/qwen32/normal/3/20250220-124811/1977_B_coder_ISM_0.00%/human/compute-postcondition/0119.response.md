Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, where each element is either '1' or '0', except possibly `s[i]` which could be '-1' if `flag` was 0, `s[i]` was '1', and `s[i + 1]` was '1'. `length` is 30. `t` remains unchanged. `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 30. If `flag` was initially 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then `s[i]` is now specifically '1'. Otherwise, `s[i]` retains its original value. `flag` is either 1 (if the if condition was met) or not 1 (if the if condition was not met). Additionally, if `flag` is not 1, either `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
