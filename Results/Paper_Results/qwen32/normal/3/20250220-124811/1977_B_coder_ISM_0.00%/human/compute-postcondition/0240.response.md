The code snippet `s[i - 1] = '-1'` modifies the list `s` by setting the element at index `i - 1` to the string `'-1'`. Given that `i` is 2, the element at index `1` of the list `s` will be changed to `'-1'`.

Output State: **`length` is either 30 or 31, `x` is the input integer, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters representing the transformed binary form of `x` with no consecutive '1's except that `s[2]` is now `'0'` and `s[1]` is now `'-1'`, and `flag` is either 0 or 1.**
