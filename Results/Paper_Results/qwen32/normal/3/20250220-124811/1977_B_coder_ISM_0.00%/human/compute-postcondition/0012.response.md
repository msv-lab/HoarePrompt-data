The code snippet appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. This means that `s` will now contain one additional element, which is `'1'`. The other variables `t`, `x`, `length`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list containing either ['1'] or ['0'] depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not, and now also contains an additional '1'; `length` is 30; `i` is `i + 1`**.
