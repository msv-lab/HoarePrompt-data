Postcondition: **`length` is 30, `x` is the input integer, `i` is 0, and `s` is a list of 30 characters representing the binary form of `x` with the least significant bit first. If `flag` was originally 1 and `s[0]` was '0', then `flag` is now 0 and `s[0]` is '0'. If `flag` was originally 0 and `s[0]` and `s[1]` were both '1', then `flag` is now 1, `s[0]` is '-1', and `s[1]` is '1'. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0 and `s` remains unchanged.**
