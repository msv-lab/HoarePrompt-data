You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each execution, it will process an input integer `x` to create a binary string `s` of length 30 or 31. The string `s` will be transformed such that no two '1's are consecutive, and all `'-1'`s will be replaced by '0's. The final `s` for each `x` will be printed, followed by the length of `s` and then the transformed `s`. The variable `t` remains unchanged after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x` and processes it to create a binary representation of length 30 or 31. It then transforms this binary representation to ensure no two '1's are consecutive, replacing any `'-1'`s with '0's. The function prints the length of the transformed binary string and the transformed string itself for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - It initializes an empty list `s` and sets `length` to 30.
   - It then iterates through the first 30 bits of `x` (since `x < 2^30`).
   - For each bit position `i`, it checks if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set using `x & pow(2, i)`.
   - If the `i`-th bit is set, it appends `'1'` to `s`; otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Adjusting for the Problem Constraints:**
   - The program then enters a loop to adjust the array `s` to satisfy the problem's constraints.
   - It uses a `flag` to manage the requirement that no two consecutive elements in `s` can be non-zero.
   - The loop iterates through the first 29 elements of `s`:
     - If `flag` is set and the current element is `'0'`, it sets the current element to `'1'` and resets the `flag`.
     - If `flag` is not set and the current element and the next element are both `'1'`, it sets the current element to `'-1'`, sets the `flag`, and continues.
     - If `flag` is set, it sets the current element to `'0'`.
   - After the loop, it checks the 30th bit:
     - If `flag` is set and the 30th bit is `'0'`, it sets the 30th bit to `'1'`.
     - If `flag` is set and the 30th bit is `'1'`, it sets the 30th bit to `'0'` and appends `'1'` to `s`, incrementing `length`.

4. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The program enters another loop to ensure that no two consecutive elements are `'-1'` and `'1'`:
     - If the current element is `'-1'` and the previous element is `'1'`, it swaps them.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the `length` of the array and the elements of the array `s`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Initial Binary Representation:**
   - The initial binary representation is correct, but the program uses strings (`'0'`, `'1'`, `'-1'`) instead of integers (`0`, `1`, `-1`).

2. **Adjustments for Constraints:**
   - The logic for adjusting the array to satisfy the constraints is flawed.
   - The program does not correctly handle the conversion of bits to the required format.
   - The final adjustment loop is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Output:**
   - The output format is incorrect. The length should be printed before the array, and the array elements should be integers, not strings.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
