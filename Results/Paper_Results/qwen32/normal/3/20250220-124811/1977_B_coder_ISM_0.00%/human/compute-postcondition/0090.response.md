Output State: **`s` is `['1']`, `length` is `30`, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 0, and the least significant bit of `x` (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)`) is not zero.**

Explanation: The list `s` now contains one element, the string `'1'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
