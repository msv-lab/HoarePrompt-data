To determine what will be printed by the `print(x - 2)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is at least 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it is mentioned for completeness).
- `n` is the first integer read from the new input.
- `x` is the second integer read from the new input.
- `y` is the third integer read from the new input.
- `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers, and the rest are strings.

### Analysis:
The `print(x - 2)` statement is only concerned with the value of `x`. Since `x` is the second integer read from the input, its exact value is not provided in the initial state description. However, we know it is an integer.

### Calculation:
The output of the `print(x - 2)` statement will be the result of subtracting 2 from the value of `x`.

### Conclusion:
Without knowing the exact value of `x`, we can only express the output in terms of `x`.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the second integer read from the input)**
