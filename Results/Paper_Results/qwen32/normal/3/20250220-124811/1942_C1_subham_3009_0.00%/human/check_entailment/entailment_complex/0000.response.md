### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by cutting diagonals from a regular polygon with `n` sides, using `x` chosen vertices. The constraint `y = 0` indicates that no additional vertices can be chosen beyond the `x` vertices already selected by Bessie.

Given that `y = 0`, we are limited to using only the `x` vertices provided. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices on a polygon is `x - 2`. This is a well-known result from combinatorial geometry, where any set of `x` points on a convex polygon can form at most `x - 2` non-intersecting triangles.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by reading the input values for each test case and then printing `x - 2` as the result. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the constraints provided.

### Correctness: **True**
