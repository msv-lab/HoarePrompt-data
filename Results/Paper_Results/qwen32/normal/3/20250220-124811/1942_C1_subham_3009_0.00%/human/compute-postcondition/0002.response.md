In this task, we need to ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once. The loop condition is `t > 0`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the variable `t` is greater than 0 right before the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Since `t` is already within the range 1 to 10^4, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is 0. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The current execution is within the main module (`__name__ == '__main__')`. `t` is assigned the value of the first input integer.**
