Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is 0. The second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The current execution is within the main module (`__name__ == '__main__')`. `t` is assigned the value of the first input integer.**

In simpler terms, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer input, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
