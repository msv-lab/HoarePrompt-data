To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j`, `start_index`, and `i`. The loop will execute if the range `range(start_index, start_index + i + 1)` is non-empty, meaning `start_index + i + 1` must be greater than `start_index`.

Let's break down the given state and constraints:
- `is_already_stairs` is `False`, which means there exists at least one `j` from `0` to `i` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`.
- `i` is not equal to `0`.
- `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`.
- The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been executed.
- The list `res` now contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`.

The loop will iterate over `j` from `start_index` to `start_index + i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be such that `start_index + i + 1` is greater than `start_index`, which is always true as long as `i` is non-negative. Given that `i` is not equal to `0`, this condition is satisfied.

Since the loop head variables are `j`, `start_index`, and `i`, and we need to ensure the loop executes, we don't need to adjust `start_index` or `i` further based on the provided information. The variable `j` is the loop variable and will be automatically adjusted by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts, focusing only on the loop head variables, does not need additional adjustments beyond what is already provided.

State: **`is_already_stairs` is `False`, `i` is not equal to `0`, `start_index` is a valid index, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`**.

Since the loop head variables are `j`, `start_index`, and `i`, and the loop will execute as long as `i` is not `0`, no further adjustments to these variables are necessary.

State: **`start_index` is a valid index, `i` is not equal to `0`**.
