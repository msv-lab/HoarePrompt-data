The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `i + 1`. Therefore, `j` should be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers with n > 0, `res` is a list that will store tuples representing the operations performed, `j` is `i + 2`. If `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is False. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` retains its original value.**

However, since `j` should be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration, the correct state should be:

State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers with n > 0, `res` is a list that will store tuples representing the operations performed, `j` is `i + 1`. If `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is False. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` retains its original value.**
