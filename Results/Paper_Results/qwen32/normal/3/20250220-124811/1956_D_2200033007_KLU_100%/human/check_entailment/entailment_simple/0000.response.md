### Reasoning:
The given program aims to solve the problem by recursively determining the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the described operations. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Memoization with `res_dict`**: The program uses a dictionary `res_dict` to store the results of subproblems defined by the indices `start_index` and `end_index`. This avoids redundant calculations and speeds up the process.

2. **Recursive Function `func_1`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `start_index == end_index`, the function returns the maximum of 1 and the value at `arr[start_index]`. This ensures that the smallest possible MEX (which is 1) is considered.
   - **Recursive Case**: For subarrays with more than one element, the function calculates the maximum sum by considering all possible splits of the array and the MEX operation. It also considers the cases where the first or last element of the subarray is included in the sum.
   - The function returns the maximum sum found, and this result is stored in `res_dict`.

3. **Recursive Function `func_2`**:
   - **Base Case**: If the subarray length is 1, the function checks if the element is already positive. If it is, no operations are needed; otherwise, it returns a single operation to set the element to 1.
   - **Recursive Case**: If the maximum possible sum for the subarray is equal to the square of its length, it means the subarray can be transformed into a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 0. The function then calls `make_stairs` to perform the necessary operations.
   - If the maximum sum is not achieved by transforming the entire subarray, the function recursively determines the optimal operations for the subarrays resulting from splitting the array at the point where the maximum sum is achieved.

4. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is responsible for transforming a subarray into a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 0.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired form. If not, it performs the necessary operations to achieve this form and updates the `res` list with the operations performed.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**: The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array by considering all possible operations and using memoization to optimize the recursive calculations.
- **Output**: The program outputs the maximum sum and the sequence of operations needed to achieve this sum.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as arrays of length 1, arrays where all elements are already in the desired form, and arrays that require multiple operations to achieve the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly implementing the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
