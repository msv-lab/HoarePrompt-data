Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not handle the problem description correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, the code does not include a definition for the `arr` and `res_dict` variables, which are used in the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs`. Additionally, the `start_index` variable is used in `make_stairs` without being defined within the scope of that function.

Furthermore, the function `make_stairs` is called within `func_2` but its behavior is not well-defined without the complete context of the array `arr` and the result dictionary `res_dict`. The logic for constructing operations and maximizing the sum is incomplete and potentially incorrect.

Here is an example case where the code does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
2
0 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4 1
1 2
```

**Actual Output:**
The code will likely throw errors due to the undefined variables and incomplete logic.

To make the code correct, the following steps should be taken:
1. Define the `arr` and `res_dict` variables properly.
2. Ensure that `start_index` is defined within the scope of `make_stairs`.
3. Complete the logic for constructing operations and maximizing the sum.

Since the provided code does not meet these requirements and does not handle the problem description correctly for all potential cases, the correctness is **False**.
