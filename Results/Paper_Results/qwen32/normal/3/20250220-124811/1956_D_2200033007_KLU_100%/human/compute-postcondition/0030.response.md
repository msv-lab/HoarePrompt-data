The value of `arr[j]` is updated to be equal to `i`. The values of `start_index`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as per the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`start_index` is a valid index, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `arr[j]` is equal to `i`**.
