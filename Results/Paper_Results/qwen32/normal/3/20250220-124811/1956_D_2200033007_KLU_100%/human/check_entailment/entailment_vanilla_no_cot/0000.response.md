Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Global Variables Usage**: The program uses global variables `arr`, `res_dict`, and `res` without defining them inside the functions. This can lead to undefined behavior and is generally bad practice in Python.

2. **Function `make_stairs`**: The function `make_stairs` assumes the existence of a `start_index` variable, which is not defined within the scope of this function. Additionally, the function modifies the array `arr` directly, which may not align with the intended logic of the program.

3. **Logic for Constructing Operations**: The logic in `func_2` to construct the operations is incomplete and may not cover all cases. The function attempts to find the optimal way to split the array and apply operations, but it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly.

4. **Handling MEX Calculation**: The program does not explicitly calculate the MEX of the subarrays, which is a crucial part of the problem. Instead, it tries to maximize the sum based on certain assumptions, which may not always yield the correct MEX values.

5. **Output Construction**: The program does not correctly construct the output sequence of operations. The logic for appending operations to `res` is flawed and may not produce the correct sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases effectively, such as when the array contains all zeros or when the array length is 1.

To correct the program, it would be necessary to properly define and manage the global variables, correctly implement the logic for calculating the MEX of subarrays, and ensure that the operations are constructed to maximize the sum of the array elements.
