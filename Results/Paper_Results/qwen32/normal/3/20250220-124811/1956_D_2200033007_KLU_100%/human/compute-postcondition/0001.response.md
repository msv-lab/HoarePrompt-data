To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which is `j` and the range `i + 1`. The loop will execute if the range `i + 1` is greater than 0, meaning `i` must be at least 0. Given that `i` is already constrained by `0 <= i < n`, this condition is already satisfied as long as `n` is greater than 0.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `j`:** This variable is initialized within the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.
2. **Range `i + 1`:** For the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be greater than 0, which is true as long as `i` is at least 0. Since `i` is already constrained by `0 <= i < n`, this condition is satisfied as long as `n` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the only variable that needs to be ensured is that `n` is greater than 0, as this guarantees that the range `i + 1` will be valid and the loop can execute.

State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers with n > 0, `res` is a list that will store tuples representing the operations performed, `is_already_stairs` is `True`**
