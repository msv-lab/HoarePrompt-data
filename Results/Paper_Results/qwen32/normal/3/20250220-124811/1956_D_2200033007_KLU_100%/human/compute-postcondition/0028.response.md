The code snippet `arr[j] = i` assigns the current value of `i` to the element at index `j` in the array `arr`. Given that `i` is decremented by 1 before this line, the value of `i` is one less than its previous value. The values of `start_index`, `i`, and the rest of the array `arr` (except at index `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start_index` is a valid index, `i` is decremented by 1, `arr[j]` is equal to the new value of `i`.**
