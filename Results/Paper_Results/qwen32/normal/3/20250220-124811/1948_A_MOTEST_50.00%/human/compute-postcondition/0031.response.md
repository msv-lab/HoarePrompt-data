The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `x` was 3, so `x` is now 4. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 5, `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", `ans` is "AAABBBCCDD", `x` is 4, `j` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, and `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1`**.
