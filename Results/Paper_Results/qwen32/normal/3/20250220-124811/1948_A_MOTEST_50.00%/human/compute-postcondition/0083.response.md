Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; `i` is 2. If `n` was initially 6, `x` is 0. If `n` was initially an odd integer at least 7, `x` is 0 and `j` is 2; `ans` is an empty string. Additionally, `n` is an odd integer.**
