The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to `n` based on the user's input. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer already, which means this line will overwrite `n` with whatever integer value is provided by the user during execution. The other variables (`t`, `s`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; `i` is incremented by 1.**
