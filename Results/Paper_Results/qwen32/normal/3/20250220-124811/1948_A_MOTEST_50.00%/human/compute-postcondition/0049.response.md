Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 4; `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is "AABBCC"; `x` is 2; `j` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by appending two characters from the string `s` starting at index `x`. Since `x` is 2, `s[x]` is "C". Therefore, `ans` becomes "AABBCC". The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
