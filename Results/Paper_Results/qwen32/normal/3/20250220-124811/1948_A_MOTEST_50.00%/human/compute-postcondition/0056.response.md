The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `x` was 1, so the new value of `x` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is not divisible by 2 and `n` is at least 5; `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is `'AAABB'`; `x` is 2**.
