The code appends to the string `ans` the character at index `x` in the string `s`, repeated twice. Given that `x` is 1, the character at index 1 in `s` is "B". Therefore, "BB" is appended to `ans`, changing its value from "AA" to "AABB".

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an even integer and not equal to 1, `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", `ans` is "AABB", `x` is 1, `j` is 1**.
