The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` modifies the variable `ans` by appending two characters from the string `s` starting at index `x`. Given that `x` is 1, `s[x]` is `B`. Therefore, `s[x] * 2` results in `BB`. The variable `ans` initially is `"AAA"`, so after the operation, `ans` becomes `"AAABB"`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 5, `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", `ans` is "AAABB", `x` is 1**.
