To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an even integer and not equal to 1.
- `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".
- `ans` is "AA".
- `x` is 1.
- `j` is 0.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(n // 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 0. Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit for the range function.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an even integer and not equal to 1, `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", `ans` is "AA", `x` is 1, `j` is 1**
