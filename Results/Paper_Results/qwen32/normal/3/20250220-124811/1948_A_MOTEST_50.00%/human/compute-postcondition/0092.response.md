The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends to the string `ans` the character at index `x` in the string `s`, repeated twice. Given that `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" and `x` is 3, the character at index 3 in `s` is 'D'. Therefore, 'D' repeated twice is 'DD', which is appended to `ans`.

Thus, the new value of `ans` becomes 'AAABBCCDD'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an odd integer that is at least 7; `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; `i` is 2; `x` is 3; `j` is 1; `ans` is 'AAABBCCDD'**.
