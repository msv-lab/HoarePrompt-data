Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that start <= end; `t` is an input integer.**

In natural language: The variables `start` and `end` remain unchanged and still satisfy the condition that `start` is less than or equal to `end`. A new variable `t` is introduced and is assigned the value of an integer input.
