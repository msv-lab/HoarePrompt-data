The `print('YES')` statement will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` because the print statement explicitly specifies the string to be printed.

Here's the breakdown:
- The value of `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- The value of `t` is 2.
- The value of `n` is an integer input by the user.
- The value of `s` is a new string input by the user.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
