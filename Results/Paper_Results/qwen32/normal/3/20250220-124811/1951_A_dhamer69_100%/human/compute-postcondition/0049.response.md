Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 2; `n` is the integer input by the user; `s` is the new string input by the user. If `n` is equal to 2, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged regardless of the number of '1's in `s` or whether `s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2`.**
