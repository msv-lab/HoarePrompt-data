The code snippet provided only resets the variable `cnt` to 0. None of the other variables are affected. Thus, the values of `ans`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and the condition `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum between the new input integer `n` and 0, `t` is `t - 1` and remains greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` remains `a[0]`, `aa` is the set containing unique elements from `a`, `cnt` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**
