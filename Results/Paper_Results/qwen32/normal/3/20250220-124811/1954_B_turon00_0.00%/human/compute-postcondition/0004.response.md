Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `tmp` is assigned the value of `a[0]`.**

In simple terms, the variable `tmp` has been assigned the value of the first element in the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
