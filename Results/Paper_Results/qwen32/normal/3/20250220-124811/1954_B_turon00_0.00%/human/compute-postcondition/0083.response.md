The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` is already incremented from its previous value. Since `cnt` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it could hold any value, but it will be incremented by 1 due to the code execution.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`**.
