Postcondition: **`ans` is `n` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is `min(ans, cnt)`. `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is reset to 0.**
