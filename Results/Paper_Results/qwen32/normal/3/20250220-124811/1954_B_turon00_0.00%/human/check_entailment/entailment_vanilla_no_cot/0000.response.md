Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful, but it does so incorrectly. The logic in the program is flawed because it only considers contiguous segments of the same number and tries to find the shortest such segment, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove so that it becomes impossible to perform the specified operation to make all elements the same. The program should check for the longest contiguous segments of the same number and consider the possibility of removing elements to break these segments in a way that prevents the array from being beautiful. The current implementation does not account for the correct conditions to break the beauty of the array.
