The code snippet increments the variable `cnt` by 1. The previous values of `ans`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `aa` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`ans` is `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
