Given the initial state that `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, we can deduce the following:

- `ans` is a variable that has been updated to hold the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`.
- `cnt` is another variable whose value is not explicitly given, but it is used in the comparison to update `ans`.

Since we don't have the specific values of `ans` or `cnt` before this operation, we can only describe the state of `ans` after the operation in terms of `cnt` and its previous value.

The print statement will output the current value of `ans`, which is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.

Therefore, the precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum of its previous value and cnt)**
