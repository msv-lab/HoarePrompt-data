In this task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times. The variables `n` and `a` are defined outside the loop and are used within the loop body, but they are not part of the loop head. Therefore, the only variable we can adjust in the loop head to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, it is already in a state that ensures the loop will execute. However, we need to ensure that the state before the loop starts is correctly described according to the requirement to adjust only the state of objects in the loop head.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0** (which is already satisfied by the given condition 1 <= `t` <= 10^4)

Since `t` is already in a valid state that ensures the loop will execute, we do not need to modify it further. The other variables `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
