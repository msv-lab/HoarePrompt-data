The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes a new input string, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. This means `a` is now a new list of integers based on the input, and all other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`; `t` is `t - 1` and remains greater than 0; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the new input list of integers; `tmp` remains `a[0]`; `aa` remains the set containing unique elements from `a`; `cnt` remains the count of the last sequence of `tmp` values.**
