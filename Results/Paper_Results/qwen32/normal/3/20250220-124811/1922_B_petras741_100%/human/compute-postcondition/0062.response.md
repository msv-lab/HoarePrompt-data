The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the loop will iterate over the range from `0` to `n` inclusive (i.e., `range(n + 1)`). Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is set to the starting value of the loop, which is `0`.

Given the provided state, `j` is currently set to `n-1`. To ensure the loop executes correctly, we need to adjust `j` to `0`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 0, `eta` is an empty list**
