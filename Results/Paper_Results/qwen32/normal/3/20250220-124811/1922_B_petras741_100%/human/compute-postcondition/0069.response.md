The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 2. If `q[j] > 0`, then `eta` is [1]. Otherwise, `eta` is not defined.**
