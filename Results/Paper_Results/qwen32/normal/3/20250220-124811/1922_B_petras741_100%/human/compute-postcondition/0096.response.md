Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` equals 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `res` is the accumulated sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, no additional changes are made to `q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, or `res`.**
