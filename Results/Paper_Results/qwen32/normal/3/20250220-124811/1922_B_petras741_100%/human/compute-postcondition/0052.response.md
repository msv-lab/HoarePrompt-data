The provided Python code snippet updates the variable `w` by reading a new list of integers from the input. The variables `t`, `i`, and `buffer` are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `n` is already defined as the number of integers that will be read into the list `w`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input.**
