After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `j` will have taken on every value from 0 to `n` inclusive. For each value of `j`, if the corresponding value in the list `q` is greater than 0, that value of `j` will be appended to the list `eta`. 

Here's the final output state:

Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `eta` contains all values `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j] > 0`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, `j` will be one more than `n`, and `eta` will have all the indices from 0 to `n` for which the value in `q` at that index is greater than 0.
