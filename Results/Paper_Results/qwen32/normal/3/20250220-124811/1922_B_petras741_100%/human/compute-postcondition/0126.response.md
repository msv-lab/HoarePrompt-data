The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `eta_ln`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on these variables.

1. The loop will execute if `eta_ln` is greater than 1. If `eta_ln` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.
2. The variable `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Before the loop starts, `j` is `n + 1`, which does not affect whether the loop will execute, but it must be set to 1 for the loop to start correctly.

Given the above points, the state needs to be adjusted so that `eta_ln` is greater than 1 and `j` is set to 1.

State: **`j` is 1, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1**
