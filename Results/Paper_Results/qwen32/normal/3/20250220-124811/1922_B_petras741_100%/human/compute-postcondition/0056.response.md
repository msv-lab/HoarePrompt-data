The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5. At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `w` is a list of `n` integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `j` is 1**
