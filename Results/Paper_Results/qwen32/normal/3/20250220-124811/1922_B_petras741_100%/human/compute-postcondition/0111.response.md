The code snippet provided is `eta.append(j)`. This appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. 

Since the initial state does not specify the initial contents of `eta`, we can assume `eta` is either an empty list or a list with some elements. After executing the code, `eta` will have `j` as its new last element. The values of `n` and `q[j]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a new input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `q[j]` is greater than 0; `eta` has `j` appended to it.**
