The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. Therefore, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will be updated to the integers provided in the input. The variable `t`, which is an integer input such that 1 <= t <= 1000, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integers provided in the input.**
