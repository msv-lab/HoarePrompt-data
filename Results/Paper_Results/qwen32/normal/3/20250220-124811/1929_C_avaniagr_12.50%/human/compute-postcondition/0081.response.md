Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. It then prints 'YES' if `a` meets or exceeds a certain threshold based on the values of `k` and `x`; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final state of the program is that it has processed all `t` test cases and printed the corresponding results.**
