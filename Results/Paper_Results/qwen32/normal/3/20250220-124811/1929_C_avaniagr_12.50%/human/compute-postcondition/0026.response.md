Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `z` is `x + 1` if `k - 1` is 1, otherwise `z` is a value determined by the loop's iterative process.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `z`, `a`, `x`, or `k` directly. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `z`, `a`, `x`, or `k`.

Output: **YES**
