Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input such that 0 <= t < 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided in the input. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then no specific change is described for `x` or `a` unless `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 3` or less than or equal to `x + 2`. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `z` is `x + 1` if `k - 1` is 1, otherwise `z` is a value determined by the loop's iterative process, and `a` is either greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`. If `a >= x + 3` when `x == k - 1`, the condition is met as described in the if part. Otherwise, no specific change is described for `a` in the else part. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is computed after `x + 1` iterations of the loop, `i` is `x + 1`, and `a` is either greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`.**

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the program after the if-else block has executed, considering all possible cases for the value of `x` relative to `k - 1`.
