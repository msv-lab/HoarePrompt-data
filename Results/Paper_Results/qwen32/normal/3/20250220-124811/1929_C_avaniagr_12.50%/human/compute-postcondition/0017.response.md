Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are the integers provided in the input. `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`; `z` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
