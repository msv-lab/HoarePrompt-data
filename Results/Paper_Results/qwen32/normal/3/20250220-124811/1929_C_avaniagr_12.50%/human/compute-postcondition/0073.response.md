Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is defined as `t - 1`. However, the initial value of `t` is not provided, so we can't determine its exact value. This doesn't affect the `print` statement directly.
2. `k` is an integer provided in the input.
3. `x` is an integer provided in the input and must be at least 0.
4. `a` is an integer provided in the input.
5. `z` is calculated using the formula: \((x + 1) + \frac{(k-1) \left(1 - \left(\frac{1}{k-1}\right)^{x+1}\right)}{k-2}\).
6. `i` is set to `x`.
7. `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print('YES')`. This statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `z`, or `i`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is a simple literal string output, the value printed will always be `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
