The `print('YES')` statement will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` as long as they satisfy the initial conditions provided (1 <= t <= 1000, x < k - 1, and a >= x + 1). 

Since the print statement is a direct output of the string 'YES', the value of the variables does not affect the output of this specific statement.

Output: **YES**
