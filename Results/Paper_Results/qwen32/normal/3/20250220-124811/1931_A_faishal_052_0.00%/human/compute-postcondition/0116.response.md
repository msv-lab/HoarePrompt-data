Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer minus 2 if it was originally <= 26, otherwise `lex` is an integer in the range -1 to 24 if it was originally in the range 27 to 51, or greater than -1 if it was originally > 51, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 6 elements where the last element is `1` and the second-to-last element is `26` if `lex` (after decrementing by 2) is greater than 24 and less than 50, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, so if it was originally <= 26, it is now <= 25 (or -1 if it was 1 originally). If it was originally in the range 27 to 51, it is now in the range 26 to 50 (or -1 to 24 if we consider the original values). If it was originally > 51, it remains > 50. The conditions for `arr` are updated to reflect the new value of `lex`. All other variables remain unchanged.
