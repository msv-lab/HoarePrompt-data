The only variable in the loop head is `k`, and it is used in the `range(3)` function. This means the loop will execute as long as `k` can take on the values 0, 1, and 2 in successive iterations. The initial value of `k` does not need to be specified because the `range` function in Python will automatically initialize `k` to 0 at the start of the loop.

The other variables `t`, `lex`, `cases`, `arr`, and `j` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The loop will run three times regardless of their values.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the variables in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `lex` is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 26 then `lex` is now `lex - 2` (and thus less than or equal to 24), otherwise `lex` is `lex - 27` if it was initially between 26 and 51, or `lex - 52` if it was initially between 52 and 77, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list that is either `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, or `[1, 26, 26]`, and `j` is 1**
