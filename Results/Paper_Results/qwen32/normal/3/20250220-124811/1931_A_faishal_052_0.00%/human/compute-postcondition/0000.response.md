Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `cases` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `cases` is assigned the value of the integer input. The initial state of `t` and the conditions for `n` remain unchanged.
