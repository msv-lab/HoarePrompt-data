To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior based on the provided initial and intermediate states. The loop runs for `j` in the range of 2, meaning it will execute exactly 2 times. However, the description provided for the states after the first 3 iterations seems to be incorrect because the loop only runs 2 times as per the given range. Let's correct this and find the final state.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Initial State:**
  - `t`: 1 <= t <= 100 (unchanged)
  - `lex`: input integer
  - `cases`: > 2 (unchanged)
  - `arr`: []
  - `i`: 3 (unchanged)
  - `j`: 0 (initially, will iterate to 1)
  - `k`: 2 (unchanged)

- **Loop Iterations:**
  - **First Iteration (j = 0):**
    - If `lex <= 26`, append 1 to `arr` and decrement `lex` by 1.
    - If `26 < lex < 52`, append 26 to `arr` and decrement `lex` by 26.
    - If `lex >= 52`, append 26 to `arr` and decrement `lex` by 26.
  
  - **Second Iteration (j = 1):**
    - The same logic as the first iteration applies.

### Final State Analysis:
- The loop runs exactly 2 times, so `j` will be 2 after the loop ends.
- `arr` will have 2 elements after the loop.
- `lex` will be adjusted based on the above logic for 2 iterations.
- `t`, `cases`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.

### Output State:
- `t`: 1 <= t <= 100 (unchanged)
- `lex`: adjusted based on the original value and the loop logic (decremented by 1 or 26 for each iteration).
- `cases`: > 2 (unchanged)
- `arr`: list with 2 elements, each element being either 1 or 26 based on the value of `lex`.
- `i`: 3 (unchanged)
- `j`: 2 (after the loop ends)
- `k`: 2 (unchanged)

### Conclusion:
The final output state after the loop has executed all iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its original value (decremented by 1 or 26 for each iteration), `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with 2 elements (each element being either 1 or 26), `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2.**
