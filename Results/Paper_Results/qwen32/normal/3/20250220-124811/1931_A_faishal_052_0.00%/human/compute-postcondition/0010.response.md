The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer `26` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `arr` contains one element, which is `26`. The other variables (`t`, `lex`, `cases`, and `n`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer greater than 26 but less than 52, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `arr` is a list containing the integer 26.**
