The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` was initially an integer greater than 26 but less than 52, after subtracting 26, `lex` will be an integer greater than 0 but less than 26. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer greater than 0 but less than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 4 elements where the last element is 26, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `k` is 2.**
