The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer `26` to the end of the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` is a list with at least 5 elements where the last element is `26` and the second-to-last element is `26` if `lex` (after decrementing by 1) is greater than `25` and less than `51`. After appending `26` to `arr`, `arr` will now have one more element, which is `26`.

Hereâ€™s the updated state:
- `t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `lex` is still an input integer minus 1 if it was originally <= 26, otherwise `lex` is an integer in the range 0 to 25 if it was originally in the range 27 to 51, or greater than 0 if it was originally > 51.
- `cases` is still greater than 2.
- `arr` now has one more element, which is `26`, making the last element `26` and the second-to-last element also `26` if the conditions for `lex` are met, with an additional `26` at the end.
- `i` is still 3.
- `j` is still 2.
- `k` is still 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer minus 1 if it was originally <= 26, otherwise `lex` is an integer in the range 0 to 25 if it was originally in the range 27 to 51, or greater than 0 if it was originally > 51, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 6 elements where the last element is 26 and the second-to-last element is 26 if `lex` (after decrementing by 1) is greater than 25 and less than 51, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2.**
