Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer in the range 0 to 25 if it was originally in the range 27 to 51, otherwise `lex` is an integer greater than 0 (if it was originally <= 26, `lex` is `lex` minus 1; if it was originally > 51, `lex` remains the same), `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 5 elements where the last element is 26, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2.**
