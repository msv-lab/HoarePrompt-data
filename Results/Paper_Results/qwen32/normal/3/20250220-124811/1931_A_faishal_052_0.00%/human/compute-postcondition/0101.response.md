Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer greater than 52, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `k` is 2.**

The `arr` list has an additional element `26` appended to it, increasing its length by one. The values of `t`, `lex`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
