Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer and its value is less than or equal to 25, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, and `arr` is a list containing the integer `1`.**

In this output state, the value of `lex` has been decremented by 1, so if it was initially less than or equal to 26, it is now less than or equal to 25. All other variables remain unchanged.
