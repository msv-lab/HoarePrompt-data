The code snippet provided appends the integer `1` to the list `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `lex`, `cases`, and `n`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer and its value is less than or equal to 26, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, and `arr` is a list containing the integer `1`.**
