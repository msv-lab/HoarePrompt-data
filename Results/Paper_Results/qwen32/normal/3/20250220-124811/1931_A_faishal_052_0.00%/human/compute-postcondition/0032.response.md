Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `lex` is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 25 then `lex` is now `lex - 26` (and thus less than or equal to -1), otherwise `lex` is `lex - 52`, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list that is either `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, or `[26, 26, 26]`, and `j` is 2.**

In simpler terms, `lex` is further reduced by 26, making it less than or equal to -1 if it was initially less than or equal to 25, or less than or equal to 26 if it was initially greater than 25. All other variables remain unchanged.
