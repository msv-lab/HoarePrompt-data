Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer value provided by the user input, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either [1, 1] or [26, 1], `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**

Explanation: The array `arr` has been modified by appending the value `1` to it. If `arr` was initially `[1]`, it is now `[1, 1]`. If `arr` was initially `[26]`, it is now `[26, 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
