The code snippet `arr.append(lex)` appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` can be one of four possible lists: `[1, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, `[26, 1]`, or `[26, 26]`. After appending `lex` to `arr`, `arr` will now have three elements, with the third element being `lex`.

Since `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value but is less than 26, the new `arr` will be one of the following:
- If `arr` was `[1, 1]`, it becomes `[1, 1, lex]`
- If `arr` was `[1, 26]`, it becomes `[1, 26, lex]`
- If `arr` was `[26, 1]`, it becomes `[26, 1, lex]`
- If `arr` was `[26, 26]`, it becomes `[26, 26, lex]`

The values of the other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value but is less than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], [26, 1, lex], or [26, 26, lex], `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `k` is 3.**
