To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and how the variables evolve over the iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(cases)`)**: This loop runs `cases` number of times. Each iteration processes a single test case.
2. **Inner Loop (`for j in range(2)`)**: This loop runs twice for each test case, adjusting the `lex` value based on its current state.
3. **Array `arr`**: This array is populated based on the value of `lex` after each iteration of the inner loop.
4. **Sorting and Printing**: After the inner loop, `arr` is sorted, and the first three elements are printed as characters.

### Iteration Details:
- **First Iteration**:
  - `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value.
  - `arr` is populated with values based on the adjusted `lex`.
  - `arr` is sorted and printed.
- **Subsequent Iterations**: The same process is repeated for each test case.

### Final Output State:
Given the pattern of the output states after the first few iterations, the final output state will be the result of processing all `cases` test cases. Each test case will contribute a sequence of three characters based on the adjusted `lex` value.

### Output State after All Iterations:
The output state after all iterations will be a concatenation of the sequences of three characters printed for each test case. Since the exact value of `lex` and the number of test cases (`cases`) are not specified, we can't determine the exact sequence of characters. However, we can describe the final state in terms of the loop's behavior.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **Concatenation of three characters for each test case, where each character is determined by the adjusted `lex` value after processing each test case.**

In natural language: The final output state will be a series of characters printed for each test case, where each test case contributes three characters based on the adjusted `lex` value after processing. The exact sequence depends on the initial values of `lex` for each test case.
