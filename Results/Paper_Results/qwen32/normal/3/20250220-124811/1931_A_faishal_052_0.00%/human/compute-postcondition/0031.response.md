The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. The initial state specifies that `arr` can be one of four possible lists: `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, or `[26, 26]`. After appending `26` to `arr`, the new possible values for `arr` are `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, or `[26, 26, 26]`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `lex`, `cases`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `lex` is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 26 then `lex` is now `lex - 1` (and thus less than or equal to 25), otherwise `lex` is `lex - 26`, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list that is either `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, or `[26, 26, 26]`, and `j` is 2.**
