The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `lex` (3 <= lex <= 78). For each test case, it determines three characters based on the value of `lex` and prints these characters concatenated together. The characters are derived from the English alphabet, with the value of `lex` being adjusted to map to specific letters.
