Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is [], `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `k` is 2. The loop will have printed the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96` in sequence.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer minus 1 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise `lex` is an integer greater than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `k` is 2. Additionally, if `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, the last element of `arr` is 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer minus 1 if it was originally <= 26, otherwise `lex` is an integer in the range 0 to 25 if it was originally in the range 27 to 51, or greater than 0 if it was originally > 51, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 5 elements where the last element is 26 and the second-to-last element is 26 if `lex` (after decrementing by 1) is greater than 25 and less than 51, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its original value: if `lex` was originally <= 26, `lex` is decreased by 2; if `lex` was originally in the range 27 to 51, `lex` is decreased by 1; if `lex` was originally > 51, `lex` remains unchanged except for the adjustments described in the else part. `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 5 elements and its last element is 26. If `lex` (after adjustment) is in the range 0 to 24, the second-to-last element of `arr` is 26 and `arr` has at least 6 elements; otherwise, if `lex` (after adjustment) is greater than 25 and less than 51, the second-to-last element of `arr` is 26 and `arr` has at least 6 elements. `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
