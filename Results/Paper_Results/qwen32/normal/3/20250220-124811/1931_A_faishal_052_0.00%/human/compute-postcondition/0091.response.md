Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is [], `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `k` is 2. The loop will have printed the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96` in sequence.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. All other variables retain their initial values.
