Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer minus 27 if the original `lex` was <= 26, otherwise `lex` is an integer greater than 0, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 5 elements where the last element is 26, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2.**

In simpler terms, the value of `lex` is reduced by 26. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, it will now be the original `lex` value minus 27. If `lex` was greater than 26, it will simply be reduced by 26, making it greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
