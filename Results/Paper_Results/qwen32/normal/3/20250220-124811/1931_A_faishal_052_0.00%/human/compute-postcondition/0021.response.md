The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26, after this operation, `lex` will be less than or equal to 0. If `lex` was initially greater than 26, after this operation, `lex` will still be a positive integer. The values of `t`, `cases`, `arr`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer such that if it was initially less than or equal to 26 then `lex` is now less than or equal to 0, otherwise `lex` is `lex - 26`, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list, if `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the integers 1 and 26, if `lex` was initially greater than 26, `arr` contains the integers 26 and 26, `j` is 1.**
