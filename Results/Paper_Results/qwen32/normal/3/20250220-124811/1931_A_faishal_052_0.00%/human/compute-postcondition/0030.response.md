The code snippet `lex = lex - 26` will adjust the value of `lex` by subtracting 26 from it. Given the initial state, `lex` could either be less than or equal to 25 or greater than or equal to 26. If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 25, it would have already been decremented by 1, making it less than or equal to 24. If `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 26, it would have been decremented by 26, making it less than or equal to 0.

After the code `lex = lex - 26` is executed:
- If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 25, it would now be less than or equal to -1.
- If `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 26, it would now be less than or equal to -26.

The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `arr`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `lex` is an integer less than or equal to -1, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list that is either `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, or `[26, 26, 26]`, and `j` is 2.**
