Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer minus 1 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise `lex` is an integer greater than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 5 elements where the last element is 1, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2. Additionally, if `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, the second-to-last element of `arr` is 26.**

In simpler terms, the list `arr` now has one more element, which is 1, added to the end. All other variables retain their initial values.
