The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer `26` to the end of the list `arr`. Given that `arr` is initially either `[1]` or `[26]`, after appending `26`, `arr` will be either `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]`.

The other variables (`t`, `lex`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer value provided by the user input, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either [1, 26] or [26, 26], `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**.
