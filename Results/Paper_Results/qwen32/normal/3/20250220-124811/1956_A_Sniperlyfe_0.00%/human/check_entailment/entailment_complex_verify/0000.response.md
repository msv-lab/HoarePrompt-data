### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies an issue with the program's output formatting. The program is supposed to output the results for each test case on a single line, separated by spaces. However, the current implementation prints each result immediately after it is computed, leading to multiple lines of output for a single test case.

The annotations provided for the code do not capture this specific issue with the output formatting. Instead, they focus on the behavior of `func_1` and the overall structure of `func_2`. The annotations do not mention the incremental printing of results, which is the key problem highlighted in the original assessment.

The corrected version of the program, as suggested in the original assessment, addresses this issue by accumulating the results for each test case and printing them all at once after processing all queries for that test case. This change ensures that the output format matches the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:

While the annotations do not explicitly address the output formatting issue, the original assessment correctly identifies and explains the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the need for a change in the program to meet the problem's output requirements.

**Final: False**

The program, as currently implemented, does not meet the problem's output requirements, even though the annotations do not highlight this specific issue. Thus, the program is incorrect based on the problem description's requirements.
