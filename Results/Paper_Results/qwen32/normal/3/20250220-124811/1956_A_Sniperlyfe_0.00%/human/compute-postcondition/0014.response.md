Based on the provided initial state, let's break down the print statement and understand what will be printed.

### Key Points from Initial State:
1. `n` is the next element in the list `qs` after the current one.
2. `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round.
3. `t` must be greater than 0.
4. `k` and `q` are integers obtained from the input.
5. `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the user input and must have at least one element.
6. `res` is a list containing three elements, each being the output of `func_1(n, p)`.

### The Print Statement:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```
This line of code converts each element in the list `res` to a string and then joins them with a space (' ') in between. The final result is a single string that is printed.

### Analysis:
- `res` is a list of three elements, each of which is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
- Without the definition of `func_1` and the specific values of `n` and `p`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `res`.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of the function and its inputs.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output a string that consists of three space-separated values, each of which is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.

Output: **result1 result2 result3 (where result1, result2, and result3 are the outputs of func_1(n, p) for three different invocations)**
