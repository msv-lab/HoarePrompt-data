The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, it does not need to be adjusted manually; it will be incremented automatically by the loop mechanism. The loop will continue to execute as long as the current value of `_` is less than `t`.

Given that the loop has just completed an iteration, the value of `_` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` should be one less than `t` at the start of the next iteration. However, since `_` is automatically managed by the loop, we only need to ensure that `t` remains unchanged and that `_` is correctly set to the next value it will take in the loop.

State: **`res` is a list containing `len(qs)` elements, each being the output of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `t` remains unchanged.**
