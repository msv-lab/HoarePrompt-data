To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the variables and their relationships based on the initial state provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **qs**: This is a list of integers obtained from the input, and it must have at least 3 integers.
2. **res**: This is a list containing three elements. The third element of `res` is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
3. **t**: This variable remains unchanged, but its value is not relevant to the `print` statement.
4. **k**: This is the first integer from the input.
5. **q**: This is the second integer from the input.
6. **p**: This is a list of integers obtained from the input.
7. **n**: This is the next integer in the list `qs`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```
This statement converts each element of the list `res` to a string and joins them with a space in between, then prints the resulting string.

Given that `res` is a list containing three elements, the output will be a string that consists of those three elements separated by spaces. The third element of `res` is specifically the result of `func_1(n, p)`, but without knowing the definition of `func_1` or the specific values of `n` and `p`, we can't determine its exact numerical value.

Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is in terms of the elements of `res`.

Output: **res[0] res[1] res[2] (where res is a list containing three elements and res[2] is the result of func_1(n, p))**
