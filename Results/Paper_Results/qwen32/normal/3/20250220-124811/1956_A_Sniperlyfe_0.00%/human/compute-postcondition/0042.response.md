The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If there are more elements in `qs`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the second element of `qs`. For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least one more element after the second element.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least three elements, `res` contains two elements where the first is the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the second is the result of `func_1(n, p)` again, `t` is `x-1`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the third element of `qs`**
