Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least the number of integers equal to the total iterations of the loop, `res` is a list containing as many elements as there are integers in `qs`, where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `t` remains unchanged, `k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.`**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `res` list will contain the results of applying the `func_1` function to each integer in the `qs` list. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, and `p`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.
