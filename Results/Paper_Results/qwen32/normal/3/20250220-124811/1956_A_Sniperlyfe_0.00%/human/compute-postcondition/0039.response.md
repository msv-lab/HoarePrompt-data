The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the first element of `qs`. For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least one more element. The next value of `n` will be the second element of `qs`.

State: **`k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `res` contains one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is `x-1`, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the second element of `qs`**
