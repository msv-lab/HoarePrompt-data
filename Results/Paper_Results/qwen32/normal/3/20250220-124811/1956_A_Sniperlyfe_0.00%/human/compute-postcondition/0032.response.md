The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `k` and `q`. The other variables (`qs`, `res`, `t`, and `p`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`k` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is a list containing as many elements as there are integers in `qs`, where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `t` is `x-1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
