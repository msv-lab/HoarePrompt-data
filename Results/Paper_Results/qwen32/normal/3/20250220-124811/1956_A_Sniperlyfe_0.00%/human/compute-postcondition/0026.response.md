Let's break down the given information step-by-step to determine what will be printed by the `print` statement.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `qs` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers.
   - `res` is a list containing two elements. The second element of `res` is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `t` remains unchanged (though it's not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
   - `k` is the first integer in the input.
   - `q` is the second integer in the input.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `n` is the next integer in `qs` after `k` and `q`.

2. **What is printed**:
   - The `print` statement uses `map(str, res)` to convert each element of the list `res` to a string and then joins them with a space.
   - Therefore, the output will be a string that contains the two elements of `res` separated by a space.

3. **Determining the values**:
   - The first element of `res` is not specified, so we can denote it as `res[0]`.
   - The second element of `res` is `func_1(n, p)`, which is a function call whose result depends on the values of `n` and `p`.

Given these points, the output will be the string representation of the elements in `res` separated by a space. Since `res[0]` and `func_1(n, p)` are not explicitly defined, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **res[0] func_1(n, p)** (where `res[0]` is the first element of the list `res` and `func_1(n, p)` is the result of the function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `p`)
