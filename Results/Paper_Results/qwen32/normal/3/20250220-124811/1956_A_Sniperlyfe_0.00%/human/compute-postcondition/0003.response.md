The code snippet `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring into an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `p`. The initial state specifies that `p` is a list of integers representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round. After executing this line, `p` will be updated to the new list of integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of players initially in the game, `p` is a list of integers provided by user input representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from the input.**
