The code provided is:

```python
qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

This line of code reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `qs`.

Given the initial state, `n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers, `t` is greater than 0, and `k` and `q` are integers. The variable `qs` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it is undefined or does not exist until this point.

After running the code, the variable `qs` will be a list of integers obtained from the user input. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `t`, `k`, `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of players initially in the game, `p` is a list of integers provided by user input representing the positions of players to be kicked out in each round, `t` must be greater than 0, `k` and `q` are integers obtained from the input, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the user input.**
