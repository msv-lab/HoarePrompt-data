Let's break down the given initial state and deduce the value of `j` that will be printed.

1. **Understanding the Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` and `n` are integers where `t >= 1` and `n >= 1`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers. `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in `a` for each `i` from `0` to `n`.
   - `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
   - `c` is defined as the minimum value between `2` and `cntl[0] - 1`.
   - The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.
   - Either `c` is `0` or `j` equals `n`.

2. **Deducing the Value of `j`:**
   - The condition `cntl[j] < 2` tells us that the count of `j` in the list `a` is either `0` or `1`.
   - The additional condition that either `c` is `0` or `j` equals `n` gives us two scenarios to consider:
     - **Scenario 1:** `c` is `0`. This implies `cntl[0] - 1 < 2`, which means `cntl[0]` can be `1` or `2`.
       - If `cntl[0]` is `1`, then `c = min(2, 1 - 1) = min(2, 0) = 0`.
       - If `cntl[0]` is `2`, then `c = min(2, 2 - 1) = min(2, 1) = 1`. This contradicts the condition that `c` is `0`, so `cntl[0]` must be `1`.
       - Given `cntl[0] = 1`, `cntl[j] < 2` is always true for any `j` (since `cntl[0]` is the only `cntl[i]` that could be `1` and `cntl[j]` for `j > 0` can only be `0`).
     - **Scenario 2:** `j` equals `n`. This directly gives us the value of `j` as `n`.

Since the second scenario directly gives us the value of `j` as `n` and fits all the given conditions (especially the condition that `cntl[j] < 2` must hold true), we can conclude that `j` must be `n`.

**Output:**
Output: **n**
