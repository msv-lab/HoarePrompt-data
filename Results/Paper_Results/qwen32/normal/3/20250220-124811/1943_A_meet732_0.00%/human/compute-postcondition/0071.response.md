Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a` for each `i` from 0 to `n`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is `j + 2`. If `cntl[j] < 2`, then `c` is `c - 1`. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
