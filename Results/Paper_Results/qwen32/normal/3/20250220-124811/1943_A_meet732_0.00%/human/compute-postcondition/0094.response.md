Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1 from its previous value, and either `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `n`, `cntl[j]`, and the condition related to `c` and `j` remain the same. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
