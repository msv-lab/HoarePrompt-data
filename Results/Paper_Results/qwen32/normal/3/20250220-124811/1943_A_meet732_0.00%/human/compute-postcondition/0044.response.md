The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `cntl` by 1. Given the initial state, `cntl[i]` is initially 1, so after the operation, `cntl[i]` becomes 2. All other elements of `cntl` remain unchanged, staying at 0.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input and must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is 2 and all other `cntl[j]` for `j != i` are 0.**
