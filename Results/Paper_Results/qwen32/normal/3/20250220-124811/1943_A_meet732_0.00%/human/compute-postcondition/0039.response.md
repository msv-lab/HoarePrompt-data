The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a list `a` from these integers. This operation modifies the list `a` based on the new input, but it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `cntl`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, and `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the original `a`.**
