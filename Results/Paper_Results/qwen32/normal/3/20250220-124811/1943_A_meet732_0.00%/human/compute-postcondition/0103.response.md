In this task, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop based on the given conditions. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` inclusive. The loop head contains the variable `j`, and we need to adjust the state of `j` and `n` for the next iteration.

Here's the given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is at least 1.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and is less than or equal to `n`.
- If `cntl[j] < 2`, then `c` is decreased by 1 from its previous value.
- If `c` is zero or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

The loop statement is:
```
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

To proceed to the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, provided that `j` is still less than `n`. The variable `n` does not change.

Given these points, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `j` was equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have terminated, so we do not need to consider that case for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `n` remains the same.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and is less than or equal to `n`**.
