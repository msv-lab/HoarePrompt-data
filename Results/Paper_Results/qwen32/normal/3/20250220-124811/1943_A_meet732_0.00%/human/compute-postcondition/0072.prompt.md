Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a` for each `i` from 0 to `n`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0; `c` is the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        c -= 1
        if not c or j == n:
            print(j)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a` for each `i` from 0 to `n`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1. Additionally, either `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a` for each `i` from 0 to `n`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is `j + 1`. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a` for each `i` from 0 to `n`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is `j + 2`. If `cntl[j] < 2`, then `c` is `c - 1`. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
