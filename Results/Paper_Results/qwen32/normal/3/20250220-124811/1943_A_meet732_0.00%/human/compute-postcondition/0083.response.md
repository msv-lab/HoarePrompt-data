The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is the next element in the list `a`, this means the element at index `i` in the list `cntl` will be incremented by 1. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input and must have at least two elements, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, `cntl[0]` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged, `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**
