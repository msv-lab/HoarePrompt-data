Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of how many times `i` appears in `a` for each `i` from 0 to `n`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0; `c` is the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0]`. The current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.**
