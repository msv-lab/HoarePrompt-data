Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` (length of permutation, number of turns, starting positions of Bodya and Sasha).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program uses a `vis` (visited) array to detect cycles in the permutation for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It correctly identifies the cycle that Bodya and Sasha will follow and stores the scores they will collect in `pathb` and `paths`.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each player, the program calculates the maximum possible score they can achieve within `k` turns.
   - It iterates through the path and calculates the score for each possible number of turns (`i`), updating the maximum score (`resb` for Bodya and `ress` for Sasha).

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the scores, the program compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Potential Issues:
- **Cycle Detection:** The cycle detection logic seems correct. It uses a visited array to track positions and breaks the loop when a cycle is detected.
- **Score Calculation:** The score calculation logic appears to be correct. It considers all possible ways to collect scores within `k` turns and picks the maximum possible score.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles the constraints well, including large values of `k` (up to \(10^9\)) by breaking the loop if `i + 1` exceeds `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. It handles cycle detection, score calculation, and comparison accurately.

**Correctness: True**
