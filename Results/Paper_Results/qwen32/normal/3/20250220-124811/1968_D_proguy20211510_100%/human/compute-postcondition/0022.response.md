In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered within the loop body. Since the loop condition is always `True`, there are no specific variables in the loop head that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration can be repeated as is.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer equal to `p[p[pb - 1] - 1]`; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` twice; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the element at index `pb - 1` is 1 and all other elements are 0; if `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
