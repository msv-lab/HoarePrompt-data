Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is the index of the first repeated element in the cycle; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is a list containing the integers from `a[initial ps - 1]` to `a[ps - 1]` until the cycle is detected and must have at least 1 element; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`; `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `curr`; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`; `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`; `i` is `i + 1` (incremented by 1); and if `k < i + 1`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged.**
