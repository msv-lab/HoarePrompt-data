The provided code snippet initializes two variables, `resb` and `ress`, both to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is the index of the first repeated element in the cycle; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is a list containing the integers from `a[initial ps - 1]` to `a[ps - 1]` until the cycle is detected; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0; `resb` is 0; `ress` is 0.**
