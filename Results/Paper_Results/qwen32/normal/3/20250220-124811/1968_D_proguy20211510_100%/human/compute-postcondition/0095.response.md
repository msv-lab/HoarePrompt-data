The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state provides a detailed description of various variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are directly used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'Draw'` as specified in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('Draw')`.
2. The string `'Draw'` is a literal string and does not depend on any variables or their values.
3. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, `i`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is the literal string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
