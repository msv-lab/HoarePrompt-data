To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the conditions under which it terminates.

The loop continues to execute until it encounters a cycle, which is detected when `vis[ps - 1]` is 1. At each iteration, the loop appends the value `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths` and updates `ps` to `p[ps - 1]`. It also marks `vis[ps - 1]` as 1 to indicate that this index has been visited.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After the first iteration, `paths` contains one element: `a[ps - 1]`.
- After the second iteration, `paths` contains two elements: `a[ps - 1]` (from the first iteration) and `a[ps - 1]` (from the second iteration).
- After the third iteration, `paths` contains three elements: `a[ps - 1]` (from the first iteration), `a[ps - 1]` (from the second iteration), and `a[ps - 1]` (from the third iteration).

The loop will terminate when `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, meaning `ps` points to an index that has already been visited. At this point, `paths` will contain all the elements from the start of the path until the cycle is detected.

Let's denote the number of iterations until the cycle is detected as `m`. The final state of the variables will be:
- `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `vis` will remain unchanged from their initial states.
- `ps` will be the index of the first repeated element in the cycle.
- `paths` will contain the elements from the start of the path until the cycle is detected.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer that points to an index already visited; `ps` is the index of the first repeated element in the cycle; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is a list containing the integers from `a[initial ps - 1]` to `a[ps - 1]` until the cycle is detected; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0.**

In simpler terms, the loop will continue until it finds a repeated index, and `paths` will contain all the elements from the start of the path until the cycle is detected.
