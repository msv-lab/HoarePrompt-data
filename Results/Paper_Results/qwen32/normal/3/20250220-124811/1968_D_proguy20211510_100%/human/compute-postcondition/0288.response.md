Postcondition: **`pathb`, `pb`, `vis`, `preb`, `paths`, and `ps` remain the same. `i` is `min(len(paths), k)`. `ress` is the maximum `curr` value computed during the iterations. `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`. If `resb` was greater than `ress` before the if-else block, `resb` remains the same. Otherwise, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and `ress`.**
