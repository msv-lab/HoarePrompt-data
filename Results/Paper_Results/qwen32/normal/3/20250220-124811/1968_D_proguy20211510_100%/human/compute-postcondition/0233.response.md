The code snippet updates the value of `ps` to `p[ps - 1]`. Therefore, the new value of `ps` is determined by the value of `p[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pathb` contains values from `a` corresponding to the nodes visited before the cycle, `pb` is the node that completes the cycle, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 0, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` and `ress` are the maximum values of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`, `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`, `paths` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`.**
