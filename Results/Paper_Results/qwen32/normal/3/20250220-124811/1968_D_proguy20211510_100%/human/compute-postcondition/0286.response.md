The given Python code snippet contains only a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state describes various variables (`pathb`, `pb`, `vis`, `preb`, `resb`, `ress`, `pres`, `i`, `paths`, `ps`) and their relationships, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'Draw'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is: `print('Draw')`.
2. The string `'Draw'` is a literal and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.
3. Since there are no variables or expressions to evaluate, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward.

Output: **Draw**
