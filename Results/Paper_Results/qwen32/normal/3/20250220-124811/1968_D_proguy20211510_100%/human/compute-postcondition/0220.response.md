In the given task, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it is designed to execute indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered within the loop body. Since the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the first iteration to proceed.

Thus, the state right before the loop can be repeated as is.

State: **`pathb` contains values from `a` corresponding to the nodes visited before the cycle, `pb` is the node that completes the cycle, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` and `ress` are the maximum values of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`, and `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`.**
