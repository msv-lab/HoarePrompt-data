To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior and the given output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop continues to execute as long as the condition `vis[pb - 1] != 1` holds true. The loop appends `a[pb - 1]` to `pathb` and updates `pb` to `p[pb - 1]`. It also sets `vis[pb - 1]` to 1, marking the node as visited. The loop terminates when it encounters a node that has already been visited (`vis[pb - 1] == 1`).

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until it finds a repeated value of `pb` (indicating a cycle or a repeated node).

### Final Output State:
The loop will terminate when `pb` points to a node that has already been visited. At this point, `pathb` will contain the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, and `vis` will have marked all nodes in this sequence as visited.

### Output State: **the output state you calculate.**
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer value from input; `k` is the integer value from input; `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates (i.e., the repeated node); `ps` is the integer value from input; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the elements at indices corresponding to the nodes in `pathb` are 1 and all other elements are 0; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(paths), k) - 1`; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`; `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`; `i` is `min(len(paths), k)`;**

### Natural Language Explanation:
The loop continues to append values to `pathb` and update `pb` until it encounters a node that has already been visited (`vis[pb - 1] == 1`). At this point, `pathb` contains the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, and `vis` marks all these nodes as visited. The values of `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, and `i` are updated based on the current state of `pathb` and `paths`, but `paths` remains empty as per the given information.
