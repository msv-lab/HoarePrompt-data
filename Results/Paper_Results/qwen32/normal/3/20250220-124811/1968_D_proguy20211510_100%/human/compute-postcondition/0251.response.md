The code snippet updates the variable `resb` by comparing its current value with `curr` and taking the maximum of the two. The values of `i`, `k`, `preb`, and `curr` are not altered by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no action is taken. `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`. `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `curr`.**
