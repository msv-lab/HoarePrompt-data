The provided initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the `print('Draw')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the specific values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, or `i`. 

The print statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **Draw**
