The code snippet provided reads four values from the input and splits them into `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. These values are read as strings initially, so they need to be converted to integers for further processing.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are updated to their respective integer values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer value from input; `k` is the integer value from input; `pb` is the integer value from input; `ps` is the integer value from input; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the integers `a[pb - 1]` from the start until a cycle is detected; `paths` is a list containing the integers from `a[initial ps - 1]` to `a[ps - 1]` until the cycle is detected; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where `vis[ps - 1]` is 1 and all other elements are 0; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(paths), k) - 1`; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`; `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`; `i` is `min(len(paths), k)`. The final result is `resb` if `resb` is greater than `ress`, otherwise it is `ress`.**
