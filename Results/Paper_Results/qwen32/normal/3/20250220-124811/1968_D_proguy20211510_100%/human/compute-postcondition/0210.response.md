Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first input integer converted to an integer; `k` is the second input integer converted to an integer; `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`; `ps` is the fourth input integer converted to an integer; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1], a[pb - 1]`; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the element at index `pb - 1` is 1 and all other elements are 0; `resb` and `ress` are the maximum values of `curr` calculated during the iterations, where `resb` is greater than or equal to `ress`; `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the point where the loop terminates; `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`; `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`. The loop or if statement is terminated.** 

In simpler terms, the loop or if statement is terminated, but all other variables retain their initial values and states as described.
