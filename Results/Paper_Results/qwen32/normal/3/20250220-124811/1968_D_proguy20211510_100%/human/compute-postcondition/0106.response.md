In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least once regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure that the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer value from input; `k` is the integer value from input; `pb` is the integer value from input; `ps` is the integer value from input; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `pathb` is an empty list; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the element at index `pb - 1` is 1 and all other elements are 0; `resb` is the maximum value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(pathb), k) - 1`; `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `min(len(paths), k) - 1`; `preb` is the sum of the first `min(len(pathb), k)` elements of `pathb`; `pres` is the sum of the first `min(len(paths), k)` elements of `paths`; `i` is `min(len(paths), k)`**
