The code snippet provided is a single `break` statement, which will terminate the most internal loop or if statement it is located within. The values of the variables do not change due to this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the exception that the loop or if statement is exited.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `k` are integer values from input; `pb` is the value of `p[pb - 1]` when the loop terminates; `ps` is the repeated node; `p` is a list of integers read from input; `a` is a new list of integers read from input; `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node and must have at least one element; `paths` is a list containing the sequence of values from the start node to the repeated node, including the repeated node; `vis` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all initialized to 0 except the indices corresponding to visited nodes which are 1; `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr`; `ress` is 0; `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`; `pres` is 0; `i` is `i + 1` if `i + 1 < len(pathb)`; `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
