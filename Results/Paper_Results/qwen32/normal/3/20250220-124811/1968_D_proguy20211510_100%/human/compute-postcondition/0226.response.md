In the provided task, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement within the loop body. Since the loop body is omitted, we assume that there are no conditions within the loop that would cause it to break, and thus the loop will always execute one more time.

Given this, we do not need to adjust any of the states to ensure the loop can execute one more time. The state provided at the end of the previous iteration can be repeated as is.

Here is the answer:

State: **`pathb` contains values from `a` corresponding to the nodes visited before the cycle, `pb` is the node that completes the cycle, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` and `ress` are the maximum values of `curr` calculated during the iterations, `pres` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `paths`, `i` is the smaller of `len(paths)` and `k`, `paths` now includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`. Additionally, if `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
