Output State: **`pathb` remains the same, `pb` remains the same, `vis` remains the same, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` up to the last iteration, `resb` is the maximum of the previous `resb` and `curr`, `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `curr`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `paths` must have at least 1 element, `ps` remains the same, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`**

Natural Language: The value of `curr` is updated to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. All other variables remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
