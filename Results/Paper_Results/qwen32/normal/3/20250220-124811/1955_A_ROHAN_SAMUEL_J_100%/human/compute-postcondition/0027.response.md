Let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\). This variable `t` seems to be a loop counter or a test case counter, but it does not directly influence the print statement.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The relationship between `2 * a` and `b` remains unchanged regardless of whether `n` is odd or even. This means that the values of `a` and `b` are fixed and do not depend on the parity of `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n // 2 * b + a)
```

### Explanation:
- `n // 2`: This expression performs integer division of `n` by 2. It gives the quotient of the division, discarding any remainder.
- `n // 2 * b`: This expression multiplies the result of `n // 2` by `b`.
- `n // 2 * b + a`: Finally, `a` is added to the result of `n // 2 * b`.

### Output:
The output of the print statement will be the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`.

Given the initial state, we don't have specific values for `n`, `a`, and `b`, but we know their roles:
- `n` is some integer.
- `a` and `b` are fixed integers, and their relationship with each other (specifically `2 * a` and `b`) is consistent.

### Final Output:
Output: **n // 2 * b + a (where n, a, and b are integers read from the input)**
