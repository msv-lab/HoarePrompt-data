The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means the initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are overwritten by the new values provided through the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. The relationship between `2 * a` and `b` remains unchanged regardless of whether `n` is odd or even.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 10,000. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers provided through the input. The relationship between `2 * a` and `b` remains the same as described, regardless of whether `n` is odd or even.
