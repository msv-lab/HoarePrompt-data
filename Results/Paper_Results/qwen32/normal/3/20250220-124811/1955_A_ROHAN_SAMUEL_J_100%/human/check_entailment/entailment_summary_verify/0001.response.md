### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the program based on the provided problem description, the program code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective:** Calculate the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.
- **Pricing:**
  - One yogurt costs `a` burles.
  - Two yogurts cost `b` burles (promotion price).

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the minimum cost based on the following logic:
- If `n` (number of yogurts) is odd:
  - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually).
  - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible and paying `a` for the last yogurt).
- If `n` is even:
  - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually).
  - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying pairs of yogurts).

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes each test case by determining if `n` is odd or even and comparing `2 * a` with `b` to decide the minimum cost.

#### Verification Against Example:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - **Input:** `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`
   - **Analysis:** `n` is even, and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`.
   - **Program Output:** `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
   - **Expected Output:** `9`.
   - **Result:** Correct.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - **Input:** `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`
   - **Analysis:** `n` is odd, and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`.
   - **Program Output:** `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - **Expected Output:** `14`.
   - **Result:** Correct.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - **Input:** `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`
   - **Analysis:** `n` is odd, and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`.
   - **Program Output:** `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
   - **Expected Output:** `15`.
   - **Result:** Correct.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - **Input:** `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`
   - **Analysis:** `n` is even, and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`.
   - **Program Output:** `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.
   - **Expected Output:** `20`.
   - **Result:** Correct.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. It accurately handles both even and odd values of `n` and correctly compares the cost of buying individual yogurts versus buying pairs under promotion.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
