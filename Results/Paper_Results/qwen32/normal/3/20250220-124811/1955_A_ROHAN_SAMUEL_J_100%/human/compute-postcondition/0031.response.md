Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. The relationship between `2 * a` and `b` remains unchanged regardless of whether `n` is odd or even. If `2 * a < b`, the condition is satisfied without any changes to `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. Otherwise, the condition is not met, and there are no changes to `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`.**
