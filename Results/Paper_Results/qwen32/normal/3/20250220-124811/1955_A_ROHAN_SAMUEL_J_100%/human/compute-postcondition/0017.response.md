To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The conditions given about `n`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the value of `a * n` directly. They only provide constraints on the relationship between `2 * a` and `b` based on whether `n` is odd or even.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a * n)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs the value of `a * n`.
- The value of `a * n` depends on the specific values of `a` and `n` which are read from the input.
- Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot compute a numerical value for `a * n`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the product of `a` and `n` based on the values provided as input.

### Final Output:
Output: **a * n (where a and n are integers read from the input)**
