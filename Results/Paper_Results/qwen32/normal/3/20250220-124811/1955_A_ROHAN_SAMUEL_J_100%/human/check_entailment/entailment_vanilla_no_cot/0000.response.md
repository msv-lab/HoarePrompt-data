To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to verify if it correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

The logic of the program can be broken down as follows:
1. For each test case:
   - Read the number of yogurts `n`, the price of one yogurt `a`, and the price of two yogurts on promotion `b`.
   - If `n` is odd:
     - Check if the cost of buying two yogurts separately (2 * a) is less than the promotion price (b).
     - If true, buy all yogurts individually, resulting in a total cost of `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible using the promotion (`n // 2 * b`) and then buy the remaining yogurt individually (`a`).
   - If `n` is even:
     - Check if the cost of buying two yogurts separately (2 * a) is less than the promotion price (b).
     - If true, buy all yogurts individually, resulting in a total cost of `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, buy all yogurts in pairs using the promotion, resulting in a total cost of `n // 2 * b`.

Let's analyze the logic against the provided examples:
1. For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
   - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9). This is false, so it buys the yogurts in pairs for `n // 2 * b` (1 * 9 = 9).
   - This matches the expected output of 9.

2. For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
   - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 9). This is false, so it buys one pair of yogurts for `n // 2 * b` (1 * 9 = 9) and the remaining yogurt individually for `a` (5).
   - This results in a total cost of 14, which matches the expected output.

3. For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
   - Since `n` is odd, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11). This is true, so it buys all yogurts individually for `a * n` (5 * 3 = 15).
   - This matches the expected output of 15.

4. For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
   - Since `n` is even, the program checks if `2 * a < b` (10 < 11). This is true, so it buys all yogurts individually for `a * n` (5 * 4 = 20).
   - This matches the expected output of 20.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
