Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `2 * a` is less than `b`, then `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. The parity of `n` (odd or even) does not affect the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`.**
