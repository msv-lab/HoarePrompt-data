Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the annotated version.

### Problem Recap
Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts at the minimum cost. He can buy one yogurt for `a` burles or two yogurts for `b` burles under promotion. The task is to determine the minimum cost for each test case.

### Program Analysis
The program iterates through each test case and calculates the minimum cost based on the logic:
- If `n` is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is cheaper than buying them individually (`2 * a`). If it is, it buys as many pairs as possible and pays for the remaining single yogurt at the regular price. Otherwise, it buys all yogurts at the regular price.
- If `n` is even, it performs a similar check and then buys all yogurts in pairs if the promotion price is cheaper, or individually otherwise.

### Code
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Verification
Let's verify the logic for different cases:

1. **Odd `n`**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, the cost is `a * n` because buying individually is cheaper.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, the cost is `n // 2 * b + a` because buying pairs is cheaper, and we need to pay for one additional yogurt individually.

2. **Even `n`**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, the cost is `a * n` because buying individually is cheaper.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, the cost is `n // 2 * b` because buying pairs is cheaper.

### Edge Cases
- **`n = 1`**: Since `n` is odd, if `2 * a < b`, the cost is `a * 1 = a`. Otherwise, the cost is `0 * b + a = a`.
- **`n = 2`**: Since `n` is even, if `2 * a < b`, the cost is `2 * a`. Otherwise, the cost is `1 * b = b`.
- **`n = 3`**: Since `n` is odd, if `2 * a < b`, the cost is `3 * a`. Otherwise, the cost is `1 * b + a = b + a`.
- **`n = 100`**: Since `n` is even, if `2 * a < b`, the cost is `100 * a`. Otherwise, the cost is `50 * b`.

### Annotated Code
The annotations describe the state of the program before and after processing each test case. The annotations confirm that the program correctly processes each test case by checking the conditions and calculating the cost accordingly.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and verifies it for various cases, concluding that the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the analysis, the program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs as per the problem description. It calculates the minimum cost accurately for all values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the given constraints.

**Final:** **True**
