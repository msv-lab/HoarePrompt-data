Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The relationship between `2 * a` and `b` remains unchanged regardless of whether `n` is odd or even. This information is not directly relevant to the given print statement.

### Code Snippet
The code snippet is:
```python
print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Analysis
- `n // 2` computes the integer division of `n` by 2, which means it divides `n` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
- The result of `n // 2` is then multiplied by `b`.

### Output Calculation
- If `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer and the result will be the product of this integer and `b`.
- If `n` is odd, `n // 2` will be an integer (specifically, the floor of `n/2`), and the result will be the product of this integer and `b`.

### Final Output
The output will be the product of `n // 2` and `b`.

Output: **n // 2 * b (where n // 2 is the integer division of n by 2 and b is the value of b)**
