### Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices `a` and `b` for one and two yogurts, respectively. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Reading:** The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Odd `n` Case:** If `n` is odd, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price `b` is cheaper than buying them individually at `2 * a`. If `2 * a < b`, it buys all yogurts individually, otherwise, it buys as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and buys the last yogurt individually.
3. **Even `n` Case:** If `n` is even, the program again checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price `b` is cheaper than buying them individually at `2 * a`. If `2 * a < b`, it buys all yogurts individually, otherwise, it buys all pairs at the promotion price.

Let's verify this logic with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is even and `2 * a < b` (10 < 9 is false), the program buys both yogurts at the promotion price, so the cost is `9`.
- **Test Case 2:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a < b` (10 < 9 is false), the program buys two yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt individually, so the cost is `9 + 5 = 14`.
- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a < b` (10 < 11 is true), the program buys all yogurts individually, so the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
- **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is even and `2 * a < b` (10 < 11 is true), the program buys all yogurts individually, so the cost is `4 * 5 = 20`.

The program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case.
