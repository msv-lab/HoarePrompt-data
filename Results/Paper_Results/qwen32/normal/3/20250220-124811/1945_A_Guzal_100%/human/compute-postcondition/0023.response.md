Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the next t lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, `b`, `c` <= 10^9; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
