The provided Python code snippet initializes a variable `k` to 0. The initial state includes `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but the code does not modify these variables. The only change is the introduction of `k` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the next t lines contains three integers a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `k` is 0.**
