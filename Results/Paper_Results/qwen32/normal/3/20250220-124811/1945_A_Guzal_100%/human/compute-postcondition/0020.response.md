To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the operations performed on the variable `k`.

### Initial State and Operations:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. Each of the next `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).
3. `n` is greater than `i + 1` (though `n` is not used in the given code snippet).
4. `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input.
5. `i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.
6. `k` is updated in each iteration based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`:
   - `k` is incremented by `a + \left\lfloor \frac{b + c}{3} \right\rfloor`.
   - If \((b + c) \% 3 \neq 0\), then `k` is further incremented by 1.

### Calculation of `k`:
For each of the `t` iterations:
- `k` is incremented by `a`.
- `k` is incremented by the integer division of `(b + c)` by 3, i.e., \(\left\lfloor \frac{b + c}{3} \right\rfloor\).
- If `(b + c)` is not divisible by 3, `k` is incremented by an additional 1.

### Final Output:
The value of `k` after `t` iterations will be the sum of all `a` values plus the sum of the integer divisions of `(b + c)` by 3 for each iteration, plus an additional 1 for each iteration where `(b + c)` is not divisible by 3.

Given that the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each iteration are not provided, the final value of `k` can be described in terms of these variables.

### Final Answer:
The `print(k)` statement will output the final value of `k` after processing all `t` lines of input.
Output: **k (where k is the sum of all a values plus the sum of the integer divisions of (b + c) by 3 for each iteration, plus an additional 1 for each iteration where (b + c) is not divisible by 3)**
