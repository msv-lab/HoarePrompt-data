Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the next t lines contains three integers a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1; `k` is `k + a + (b + c) // 3`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the expression `a + (b + c) // 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
