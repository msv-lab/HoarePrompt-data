The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into three integers, which are then assigned to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of `t` and the constraints on `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the next t lines contains three integers a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input.**
