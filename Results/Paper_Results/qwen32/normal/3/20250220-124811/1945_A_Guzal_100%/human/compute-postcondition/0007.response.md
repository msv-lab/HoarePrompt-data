The code snippet modifies the value of `k` by adding the value of `a` plus the integer division of `b + c` by 3. The values of `t`, the precondition involving `b` and `c`, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the next t lines contains three integers a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`.**
