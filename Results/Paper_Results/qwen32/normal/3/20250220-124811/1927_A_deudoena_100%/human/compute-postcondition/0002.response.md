The code snippet `s = input()` assigns a new value to the variable `s` based on the input provided. The initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string. After executing the `input()` function, `s` will be updated to whatever string is provided as input, but it will still satisfy the condition that it consists of characters 'W' or 'B', and contains at least one 'B'. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ma`, `mi`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `ma` is 0; `mi` is 0; `m` is an input integer.**
