Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `ma` is `n - 2`; `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`; `m` is an input integer; `c` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`; `d` is 2; `l` is an empty list; `j` is the second last character of `s` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
