Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. The logic used in the function `func_1()` does not correctly determine the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white. The function seems to be trying to find the first and last black cells and then calculating the distance between them, but it does not account for the possibility of having multiple segments of black cells that might require a shorter segment to be painted.

For example, in the first test case of the example, the strip is "WBBWBW". The correct minimum segment length is 4 (from the 2nd to the 5th cell), but the function might incorrectly calculate it as something else due to its flawed logic.

A correct approach would involve finding the longest continuous segment of black cells, as painting that segment will ensure all black cells are painted white with the minimum segment length.
