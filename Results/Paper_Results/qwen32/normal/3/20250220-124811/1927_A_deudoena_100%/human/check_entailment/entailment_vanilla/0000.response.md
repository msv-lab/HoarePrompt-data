Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells in a strip white. The strip is represented by a string of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two main parts:
1. The main loop that reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.
2. The function `func_1()` which calculates the minimum length of the segment to be painted white.

Let's break down `func_1()`:
- The function initializes `ma` and `mi` to 0. These variables will be used to store the positions of the last and first black cells, respectively.
- It reads the length of the strip `m` and the strip string `s`.
- It then looks for the first occurrence of 'B' from the start of the string and stores its position in `mi`.
- Next, it looks for the first occurrence of 'B' from the end of the string and stores its position in `ma`.
- Finally, it returns `ma - mi + 2` as the minimum length of the segment to be painted white.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The logic in the program is flawed. The calculation of `ma - mi + 2` does not correctly determine the minimum length of the segment. Here's why:

- The function correctly identifies the positions of the first and last 'B' in the string.
- However, the minimum segment to be painted white should be the distance between the first and last 'B' plus one (not plus two). This is because the segment includes both the first and last 'B'.
- Additionally, the logic does not consider cases where the entire segment between the first and last 'B' might not be necessary if there are multiple segments of 'B's that can be covered more efficiently.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input "BBWBB". The program would identify the first 'B' at position 1 and the last 'B' at position 5. It would then calculate the segment length as `5 - 1 + 2 = 6`, which is incorrect. The correct minimum length is 3 (the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B', inclusive).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the minimum length of the segment to be painted white.

Correctness: **False**
