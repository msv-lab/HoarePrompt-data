You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates and returns the length of the substring of `s` that starts at the first occurrence of 'B' and ends at the last occurrence of 'B', inclusive, plus 2.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells in a strip white. The strip is represented by a string of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two main parts:
1. The main loop that reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.
2. The function `func_1()` which calculates the minimum length of the segment to be painted white.

Let's break down `func_1()`:
- The function initializes `ma` and `mi` to 0. These variables will be used to store the positions of the last and first black cells, respectively.
- It reads the length of the strip `m` and the strip string `s`.
- It then looks for the first occurrence of 'B' from the start of the string and stores its position in `mi`.
- Next, it looks for the first occurrence of 'B' from the end of the string and stores its position in `ma`.
- Finally, it returns `ma - mi + 2` as the minimum length of the segment to be painted white.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The logic in the program is flawed. The calculation of `ma - mi + 2` does not correctly determine the minimum length of the segment. Here's why:

- The function correctly identifies the positions of the first and last 'B' in the string.
- However, the minimum segment to be painted white should be the distance between the first and last 'B' plus one (not plus two). This is because the segment includes both the first and last 'B'.
- Additionally, the logic does not consider cases where the entire segment between the first and last 'B' might not be necessary if there are multiple segments of 'B's that can be covered more efficiently.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input "BBWBB". The program would identify the first 'B' at position 1 and the last 'B' at position 5. It would then calculate the segment length as `5 - 1 + 2 = 6`, which is incorrect. The correct minimum length is 3 (the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B', inclusive).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the minimum length of the segment to be painted white.

Correctness: **False**
