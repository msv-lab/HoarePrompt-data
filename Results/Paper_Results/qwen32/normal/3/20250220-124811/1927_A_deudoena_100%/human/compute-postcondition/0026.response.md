Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `ma` is `len(s) - 1`; `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`; `m` is an input integer; `c` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`; `d` is 1; `l` is an empty list; `j` is the last character of `s` and `j` equals 'B'; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `ma`, `mi`, `m`, `c`, `d`, `l`, and `j` remain unchanged. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
