The code snippet `ma = len(s) - d` calculates the new value of `ma` by subtracting `d` from the length of the string `s`. Given that `d` is 2, `ma` will be updated to `len(s) - 2`.

Since `s` is a string of length `n` and `d` is 2, the new value of `ma` is `n - 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `ma` is `n - 2`; `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`; `m` is an input integer; `c` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`; `d` is 2; `l` is an empty list; `j` is the second last character of `s`. If `j` equals 'B', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
