Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"); `trump` is assigned the value of `input()`, which must be a valid card or part of a string containing valid cards; `trumps` is a non-empty list containing the ranks of all cards whose suits match the `trump`; `answers` is a list containing the sorted pairs of ranks for each suit that had more than one card of that suit, concatenated with the suit; `suits` is a dictionary where each key ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') has the value `None` if there were an even number of cards for that suit or no cards, and has the rank of the unpaired card for that suit if there was an odd number of cards; `suits` must contain at least one entry, e.g., `suits = {'C': '7'}`.**
