The `print('IMPOSSIBLE')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variable or object defined in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'IMPOSSIBLE' as it is.

Here's the breakdown:
- The string 'IMPOSSIBLE' is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
- No variables or objects from the initial state are involved in this print statement.

Therefore, the output will be the exact string 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

Output: **IMPOSSIBLE**
