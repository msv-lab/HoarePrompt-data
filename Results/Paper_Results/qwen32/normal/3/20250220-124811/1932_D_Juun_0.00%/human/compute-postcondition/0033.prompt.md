Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"); `trump` is assigned the value of `input()`; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is an empty list; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and each key has the value `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"); `trump` is assigned the value of `input()`, which must be a valid card or part of a string containing valid cards; `rank` is the rank of the first card in `cards`; `suit` is the suit of the first card in `cards`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the first card in `cards`. Otherwise, `trumps` is an empty list and `answers` is a list containing one string if `suits[suit]` was not `None`, which is the sorted combination of `suits[suit]` and `rank` concatenated with `suit`, or `answers` is an empty list if `suits[suit]` was `None`. The value of `suits[suit]` is `None` if it was not `None` before, or it is the value `rank` if it was `None` before.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"); `trump` is assigned the value of `input()`, which must be a valid card or part of a string containing valid cards; `rank` is the rank of the next card in `cards`; `suit` is the suit of the next card in `cards`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the first card in `cards` and the `rank` of the current card. Otherwise, `trumps` is an empty list and `answers` is a list containing one string if `suits[suit]` was not `None`, which is the sorted combination of `suits[suit]` and `rank` concatenated with `suit`, or `answers` is an empty list if `suits[suit]` was `None`. The value of `suits[suit]` is updated to `rank` if it was `None` before, or it is updated to the sorted combination of `suits[suit]` and `rank` if it was not `None` before. `card` is the next card in the input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump_suit` is a character that is one of "CDHS"; `cards` is a list of 2n unique two-character strings where each string consists of a rank (one of "23456789") followed by a suit (one of "CDHS"); `trump` is assigned the value of `input()`, which must be a valid card or part of a string containing valid cards; `rank` is the rank of the current card in `cards`; `suit` is the suit of the current card in `cards`; `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the first card in `cards` and the `rank` of the current card if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is a list containing one string if `suits[suit]` was not `None`, which is the sorted combination of `suits[suit]` and `rank` concatenated with `suit`, or `answers` is an empty list if `suits[suit]` was `None`; the value of `suits[suit]` is updated to `rank` if it was `None` before, or it is updated to the sorted combination of `suits[suit]` and `rank` if it was not `None` before; `card` is `next_card`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
