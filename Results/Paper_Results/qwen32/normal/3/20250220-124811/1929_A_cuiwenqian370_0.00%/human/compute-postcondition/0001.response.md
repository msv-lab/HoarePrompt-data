The provided code initializes an empty list `new_arr`. The variables `n` and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is an empty list.**
