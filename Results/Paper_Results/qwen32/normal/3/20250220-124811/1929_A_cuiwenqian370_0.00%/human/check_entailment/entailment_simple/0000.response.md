### Reasoning:

The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. The provided program attempts to achieve this by sorting the array and then rearranging the elements in an alternating fashion between the largest and smallest remaining elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows easy access to the smallest and largest elements.

2. **Alternating Rearrangement**: The program then rearranges the elements in the `new_arr` list by alternating between the largest and smallest elements from the sorted array. This is done using two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `left` starts from the beginning of the sorted array and `right` starts from the end. Elements are added to `new_arr` starting from the largest element (pointed by `right`), then the smallest element (pointed by `left`), and so on, until all elements are included.

3. **Calculating Beauty**: After rearranging the elements, the program calculates the beauty of the array by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the `new_arr` list.

This approach works because alternating between the largest and smallest elements maximizes the absolute differences, thereby maximizing the beauty of the array.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's verify the approach with the first test case from the problem statement:
- Input: `3, 2 1 3`
- After sorting: `1 2 3`
- After alternating rearrangement: `3 1 2`
- Calculating beauty: `|3-1| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 - 1 + 2 - 1 = 2`

This matches the expected output of `2`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and rearranging the elements in an alternating fashion between the largest and smallest elements. Therefore, the program is correct.
