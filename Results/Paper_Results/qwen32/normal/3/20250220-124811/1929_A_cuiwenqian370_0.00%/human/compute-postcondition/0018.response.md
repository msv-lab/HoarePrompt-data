The value of `left` is incremented by 1. 

- If `n` is 2, `right` is 1, and since `left` was initially 1, `left` now equals `right`. Therefore, `new_arr` will have the element at index 1 of `arr` appended to it.
- If `n` is greater than 2, `right` is `n - 2`, and since `left` was initially 1, `left` is now 2. `left` does not equal `right` unless `n` is 4. If `n` is 4, `right` is 2, and `left` also becomes 2, so `new_arr` will have `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` appended to it (which are the same element, `arr[2]`).

Output State: **`left` is 2; if `n` is 2, `new_arr` has the element at index 1 of `arr` appended to it; if `n` is greater than 2, `new_arr` has `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` appended to it if `left` equals `right` (only possible if `n` is 4); `right` is 1 if `n` is 2, otherwise `right` is `n - 2`.**
