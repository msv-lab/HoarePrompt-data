In this case, the only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the loop starts with `i` equal to 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

The states of `left`, `right`, `new_arr`, and `max_beauty` are not directly related to the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. However, we can ensure that `n` is greater than 1 to make sure the loop runs at least once.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 1. The initial value of `i` does not need adjustment as the loop initializes it to 1.

State: **`left` will be equal to `right + 1` after the loop terminates; `right` will be equal to `left - 1`; `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` but arranged such that the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes; `max_beauty` is 0; `n` must be greater than 1**
