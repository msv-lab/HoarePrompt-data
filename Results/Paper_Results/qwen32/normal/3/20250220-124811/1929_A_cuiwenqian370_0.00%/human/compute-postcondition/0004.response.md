To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `left <= right` is satisfied right before the loop starts.

Given the state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order
- `new_arr` is an empty list
- `left` is 0
- `right` is `n - 1`

The condition for the loop to execute is `left <= right`.

Since:
- `left` is initialized to 0
- `right` is initialized to `n - 1`

For the loop to execute, `left` (which is 0) should be less than or equal to `right` (which is `n - 1`). Given that `n` is at least 2, `n - 1` will always be at least 1, ensuring that `0 <= n - 1` is always true.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `left` and `right` to satisfy the loop condition. The state right before the loop already allows the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`**
