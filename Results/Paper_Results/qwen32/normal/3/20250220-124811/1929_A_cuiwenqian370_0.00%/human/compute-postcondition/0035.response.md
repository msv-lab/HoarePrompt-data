To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it affects the variables. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, and for each iteration, it updates the `max_beauty` variable by adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i-1]`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. `left` will be equal to `right + 1` after the loop terminates.
2. `right` will be equal to `left - 1`.
3. `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` but arranged such that the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes.
4. `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.

Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, the final value of `max_beauty` will be the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`left` will be equal to `right + 1` after the loop terminates; `right` will be equal to `left - 1`; `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` but arranged such that the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes; `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `left` and `right` will have their final values as specified, `new_arr` will be rearranged as described, and `max_beauty` will reflect the total "beauty" calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.
