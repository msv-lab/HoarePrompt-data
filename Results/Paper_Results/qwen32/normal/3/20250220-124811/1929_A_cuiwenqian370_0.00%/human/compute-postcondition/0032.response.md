Output State: **`left` will be equal to `right + 1` after the loop terminates; `right` will be equal to `left - 1`; `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` but arranged such that the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes; `max_beauty` is `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])` where `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `max_beauty` has been updated by adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[2]` and `new_arr[1]`. The values of `left`, `right`, `new_arr`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
