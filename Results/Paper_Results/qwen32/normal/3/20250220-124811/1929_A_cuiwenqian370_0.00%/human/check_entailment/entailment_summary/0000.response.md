### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The provided program sorts the array and then alternates between the largest and smallest remaining elements to form a new array. This approach is designed to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements, thereby maximizing the beauty of the array.

Let's break down the steps in the program:
1. **Sorting the Array:** The array is sorted in ascending order.
2. **Rearranging the Array:** The program then creates a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array. This is done by maintaining two pointers, `left` and `right`, which start at the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively. Elements at these positions are added alternately to the new array.
3. **Calculating Beauty:** The beauty is calculated by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the newly formed array.

This strategy works because by alternating between the largest and smallest elements, we create the largest possible differences between consecutive elements, which in turn maximizes the beauty of the array.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Test Case 1:** For the input `[2, 1, 3]`, sorting gives `[1, 2, 3]`. Rearranging to alternate gives `[3, 1, 2]` or `[1, 3, 2]`. The beauty is `|3-1| + |1-2| = 2` or `|1-3| + |3-2| = 2`.
- **Test Case 2:** For the input `[69, 69, 69]`, sorting gives `[69, 69, 69]`. Rearranging does not change the array. The beauty is `|69-69| + |69-69| = 0`.
- **Test Case 3:** For the input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. Rearranging gives `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`. The beauty is `|100-43| + |43-90| + |90-54| + |54-80| = 57`.
- **Test Case 4:** For the input `[3, 4, 3, 3]`, sorting gives `[3, 3, 3, 4]`. Rearranging gives `[4, 3, 3, 3]`. The beauty is `|4-3| + |3-3| + |3-3| = 1`.
- **Test Case 5:** For the input `[2, 1]`, sorting gives `[1, 2]`. Rearranging gives `[2, 1]`. The beauty is `|2-1| = 1`.

All these test cases align with the expected output, confirming that the program's logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
