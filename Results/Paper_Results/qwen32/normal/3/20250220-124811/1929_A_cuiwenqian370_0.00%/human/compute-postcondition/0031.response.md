The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. The variable `n` remains the same.

Hereâ€™s the adjusted state:

State: **`left` will be equal to `right + 1` after the loop terminates; `right` will be equal to `left - 1`; `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` but arranged such that the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes; `max_beauty` is `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])`; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is incremented by 1**

Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be 2 for the next iteration to proceed.

State: **`left` will be equal to `right + 1` after the loop terminates; `right` will be equal to `left - 1`; `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` but arranged such that the largest elements come first, followed by the smallest elements, alternating between the two extremes; `max_beauty` is `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])`; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2**
