Let's evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, the code, the annotations, and the initial assessment.

### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to maximize the beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array.

### Provided Program Recap
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted in ascending order.
3. **Alternating Construction**: A new array is constructed by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array.
4. **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty of the new array is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
5. **Output**: The maximum beauty for each test case is printed.

### Annotations Recap
- The array is sorted.
- The new array is constructed by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
- The beauty is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.

### Original Assessment Recap
The original assessment claims that the program correctly maximizes the beauty of the array by alternating between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array.

### Evaluation
Let's verify if the alternating construction method indeed maximizes the beauty of the array.

#### Key Insight
To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. The alternating construction method does this by placing the largest and smallest elements next to each other, which indeed maximizes the differences.

#### Verification Using Annotated Code
The annotations confirm that the new array is constructed by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array. This means the array will look something like `[max1, min1, max2, min2, ..., maxk, mink]` or `[max1, min1, max2, min2, ..., maxk]` depending on whether `n` is odd or even.

Let's consider the differences:
- `max1 - min1` is maximized because `max1` is the largest and `min1` is the smallest.
- `max2 - min2` is maximized for the same reason.
- This pattern continues, ensuring that each difference is maximized.

Thus, the alternating construction method does indeed maximize the beauty of the array.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly maximizes the beauty of the array by sorting the elements and then constructing a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
