Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is N, `s` is the last index where a change in `nums` occurred or N, `num` is `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`, and `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. If `ppp` is 23, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables also remains unchanged as there is no else part.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if tc > 5:
        if ppp == 23:
            print(l, r)
        continue
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is N, `s` is the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`, `num` is `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `e` is the second element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`. If `s` is greater than `l`, and `s` is equal to 1, then `s` is also greater than `l`. If `s` is greater than `l` and not equal to 1, then `s` is still greater than `l`. If `s` is less than or equal to `l`, and `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `s` is less than or equal to `l` and `e` is less than `r`, the state of the variables remains unchanged regardless of whether `e` is less than or greater than `N`. If `tc` is greater than 5 and `ppp` is 23, the state of the variables remains unchanged in all cases. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as well.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The state of the variables remains unchanged regardless of whether `s` is greater than `l` or not. Specifically, `i` is `N`, `s` is the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`, `e` is the second element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`, `num` is `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` and `r` are the new integers from the input, `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order. If `s` is greater than `l` and `s` is equal to 1, then `s` is also greater than `l`. If `s` is greater than `l` and not equal to 1, then `s` is still greater than `l`. If `s` is less than or equal to `l` and `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `s` is less than or equal to `l` and `e` is less than `r`, the state of the variables remains unchanged regardless of whether `e` is less than or greater than `N`. The state of the variables remains unchanged if `tc` is greater than 5, regardless of the value of `ppp`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `N`, `s` is the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`, `e` is the second element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`, `num` is `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` and `r` are the new integers from the input, `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, and `tc` is greater than 5 or `tc` is less than or equal to 5 and `ppp` is unspecified. If `s > l`, there is no change in the variables. If `s <= l`, the value of `e` is compared to `r`, but the values of the variables remain unchanged regardless of whether `e >= r` or `e < r`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
