Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
1. `i` is set to `N`.
2. `s` is the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]` and is explicitly given as `1`.
3. `s` is greater than `l`.
4. `num` is `nums[N]`.
5. `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`.
6. `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
7. `l` is the first integer from the input.
8. `r` is the second integer from the input.
9. `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
10. `e` is the second element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`.
11. If `tc` is greater than 5 and `ppp` is 23, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as well.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(-1, -1)` is straightforward. It prints the two integers `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of any variables in the initial state. The values of `i`, `s`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `e`, `tc`, and `ppp` do not influence the output of this print statement.

### Output:
Output: **-1, -1**
