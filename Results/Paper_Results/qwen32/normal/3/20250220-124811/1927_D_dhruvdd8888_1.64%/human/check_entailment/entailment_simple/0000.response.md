Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to handle multiple test cases where for each test case, we have an array and a series of queries. Each query asks if there are two different elements within a specified subarray. If such elements exist, we need to return their indices; otherwise, we return `-1 -1`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the array `nums`, the number of queries `q`, and then the queries themselves.

2. **Segmentation of the Array:**
   - The program creates segments of the array where each segment consists of contiguous elements that are the same.
   - It uses a list `arr` to store these segments as tuples `(start_index, end_index, value)`.
   - The segments are created by iterating through the array and identifying where the value changes.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or after the left boundary of the query.
   - It then checks if the segment can provide a valid pair of indices:
     - If the segment starts after the left boundary, it checks the previous segment.
     - If the segment ends before the right boundary, it checks the next segment.
     - If no valid pair is found within the segment, it reports `-1 -1`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Handling of Queries:**
   - The program does not correctly handle all cases of queries.
   - Specifically, the logic for finding a valid pair of indices is flawed. The program only checks the segment that starts at or after the left boundary and the segment that ends before the right boundary, but it does not properly handle cases where the valid pair might be within the same segment or across multiple segments.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases effectively. For example, if the subarray contains only one unique element, it should correctly return `-1 -1`.
   - The program also does not handle cases where the subarray contains exactly two different elements correctly.

3. **Debugging Code:**
   - The program includes debugging code (`print(nums)` and `print(l, r)`) that is not necessary for the solution and might be confusing.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program is not correctly solving the problem as described. It fails to handle various cases and does not provide the correct output for all possible inputs.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
