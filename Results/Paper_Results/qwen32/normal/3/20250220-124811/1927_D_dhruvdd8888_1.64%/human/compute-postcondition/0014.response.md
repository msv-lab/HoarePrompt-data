The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `N` must be at least 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `N` does not need to be changed as long as it remains at least 0 to ensure the loop can continue.

State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `num` is `nums[0]`, and if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `arr` has a new element `(1 + s, 0, num)` appended to it.**
