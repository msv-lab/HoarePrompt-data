The code appends a new tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple consists of three elements: `(1 + s, i, num)`. Given the initial state, `s` is 0, `i` is 1, and `num` is `nums[0]`. Therefore, the new tuple added to `arr` will be `(1 + 0, 1, nums[0])`, which simplifies to `(1, 1, nums[0])`.

The variable `arr` is updated to include this new tuple, but the values of `N`, `i`, `s`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `num` is `nums[0]`, and `arr` has a new element `(1, 1, nums[0])` appended to it.**
