The code snippet `l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `l` and `r`. The other variables (`i`, `s`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is N, `s` is the last index where a change in `nums` occurred or N, `num` is `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` is the first integer from the input, and `r` is the second integer from the input.**
