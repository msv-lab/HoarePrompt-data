The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1, -1`. The initial state details various variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables. It simply outputs the values `-1` and `-1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`.
2. The values `-1` and `-1` are explicitly provided in the statement and do not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state.
3. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be `-1, -1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
