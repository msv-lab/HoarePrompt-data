The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `arr`. This action does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`N`, `a`, `q`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, `num`). Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables, except for the newly introduced `arr`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the array `a` for a test case; `a`, `q`, and the queries remain unchanged; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is an empty list.**
