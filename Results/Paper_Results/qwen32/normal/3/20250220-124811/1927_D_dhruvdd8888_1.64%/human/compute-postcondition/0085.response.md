To determine the output of the `print(s, e + 1)` statement, we need to understand the values of `s` and `e` based on the given initial state.

1. **Variable `s`**:
   - `s` is defined as the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, which is the last index of the list `arr`.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - Therefore, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)`. This means `s` will be the first element of the tuple at the position that is either `eli` or the last index of `arr`, whichever is smaller.

2. **Variable `e`**:
   - `e` is defined as the second element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`.
   - Following the same logic as `s`, `e` will be the second element of the tuple at the position `min(eli, LA)`.

3. **Expression `e + 1`**:
   - This expression simply adds 1 to the value of `e`.

Given that `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`, the elements of each tuple in `arr` are structured as `(value, start_index, length)`. Therefore:
- `s` (the first element of the tuple) represents the value of the segment.
- `e` (the second element of the tuple) represents the start index of the segment.
- `e + 1` will be the index immediately following the start index of the segment.

Since the exact values of `arr`, `eli`, `LA`, `l`, and `nums` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `s` and `e`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the value of the segment and e + 1 is the index immediately following the start index of the segment at the position min(eli, LA) in the list arr)**
