You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) which are the elements of the array a. The following line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of the values of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of the values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: i is N, s is the last index where a change in nums occurred or N, num is nums[N], arr contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in nums.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    if (ppp == 23) :
        print(nums)
        #This is printed: nums (where nums is the list of elements as defined by the initial state)
    #State: `i` is N, `s` is the last index where a change in `nums` occurred or N, `num` is `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`, and `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. If `ppp` is 23, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables also remains unchanged as there is no else part.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if tc > 5:
            if ppp == 23:
                print(l, r)
            continue
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: `i` is N, `s` is the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`, `num` is `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers which are the elements of the array `a`. Then, it accepts an integer `q` representing the number of queries, followed by `q` lines each containing two integers `l` and `r` representing the boundaries of the query. The function returns the sum of the elements in the subarray `a[l-1:r]` for each query.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
