The variable `s` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables (`N`, `nums`, and `arr`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, `arr` has a new element `(1 + s, 0, num)` appended to it.**

In natural language: The value of `s` is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state.
