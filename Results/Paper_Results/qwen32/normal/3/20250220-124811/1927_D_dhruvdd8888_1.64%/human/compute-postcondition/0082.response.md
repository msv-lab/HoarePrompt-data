To determine the output of the `print(s - 1, s)` statement, we need to understand the values of the variables `s` and `i` based on the given initial state.

1. **Understanding `s`:**
   - `s` is defined as the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the list `arr`.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
   - Therefore, `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.

2. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement will output `s - 1` and `s`.
   - Since `s` is the first element of a tuple in `arr`, it is an integer.

Given the above understanding, the output of the `print` statement will be `s - 1` and `s`, where `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at the index min(eli, LA) in the list arr)**
