To determine what will be printed by the `print(nums)` statement, we need to understand the context provided by the initial state. However, the initial state description does not explicitly mention the contents of the `nums` list. It only provides information about other variables and their relationships to `nums`.

Given the information:
- `i` is `N`
- `s` is the last index where a change in `nums` occurred or `N`
- `num` is `nums[N]`
- `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`
- `ppp` is 23

The critical piece of information here is that the `nums` list is mentioned, but its exact contents are not specified. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, we can describe the print statement's output in terms of the `nums` list.

Output: **nums (where nums is the list of elements as defined by the initial state)**

Since the exact elements of `nums` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the list itself.
