The provided code snippet uses the `bisect_left` function to find the insertion point for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the list `arr`. This operation does not change the values of the existing variables but introduces a new variable `eli` which holds the result of the `bisect_left` function.

Since the code does not modify `i`, `s`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `tc`, or `ppp`, their states remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `eli`, which holds the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.

Output State: **`i` is N, `s` is the last index where a change in `nums` occurred or N, `num` is `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order. If `tc` is greater than 5 and `ppp` is 23, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as well.**
