Postcondition: **`i` is N, `s` is the first element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`, `num` is `nums[N]`, `arr` contains tuples representing contiguous segments of equal elements in `nums`, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, `l` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `e` is the second element of `arr[min(eli, LA)]`. Additionally, `s` is less than or equal to `l`. `e` is less than `r`. If `tc` is greater than 5 and `ppp` is 23, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as well.**
