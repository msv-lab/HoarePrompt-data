The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) which are the elements of the array a. The following line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of the values of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of the values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
