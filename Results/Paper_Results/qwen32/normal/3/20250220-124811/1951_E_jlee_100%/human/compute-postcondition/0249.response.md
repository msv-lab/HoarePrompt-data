To determine what will be printed by the `print(string[:j], string[j:])` statement, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the conditions provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This variable doesn't directly influence the print statement.
2. **`string`**: The input string.
3. **`s`**: A list of characters derived from `string`.
4. **`n`**: The length of `string`.
5. **`x`**: The first character of `string`.
6. **`j`**: Initialized to 1.
7. **`i`**: Initialized to 0.
8. **`count`**: Not explicitly initialized but set to 1 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.
9. **`count2`**: Not explicitly initialized but set to 1 if `s[j]` is equal to `x` when `count` is greater than 0.
10. **`done`**: Set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or if `count` is greater than 0 and `count2` is less than or equal to `count`.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **`j`** is initialized to 1, so the initial slice of `string[:j]` will be the first character of the string, and `string[j:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the second character.
- **`count`** is set to 1 if `s[j]` (which is `s[1]` initially) is not equal to `x` (the first character of the string).
- **`done`** is set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` (i.e., the character at position `j` is not equal to the character at the mirrored position from the end of the string) or if `count` is greater than 0 and `count2` is less than or equal to `count`.

### Key Points to Consider:
- The print statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])` will execute immediately after the initial setup and before any loop or further conditions are checked.
- Since `j` is 1, `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`, and `string[j:]` will be the rest of the string.

### Output Calculation:
Given the initial value of `j` which is 1, the print statement will output the first character of the string followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Final Output:
Output: **the first character of `string`, the rest of `string` starting from the second character** (where the first character of `string` is `s[0]` and the rest of `string` starting from the second character is `s[1:]`)

For example, if `string` is "example", the output will be:
Output: **e xample**
