Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `string` is the new value of the input.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
   - `n` is the length of the new `string`.
   - `x` is the first character of the new `string`.
   - `count` is the index of the first character not equal to `x` in the new `string`.
   - `count2` is the count of characters equal to `x` after `count` in the new `string`.
   - `done` is `False`.
   - `j` is `n` (indicating all iterations are completed).
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `done` remains `False`.

2. **Condition:**
   - If the first character `x` is not equal to the last character of the `string`, the condition `x != s[-1]` holds true.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet simply contains `print('NO')`.

### Explanation:
- The `print('NO')` statement is executed regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, `done`, `j`, and `i`.
- The only condition mentioned in the initial state is `x != s[-1]`, but this condition does not affect the execution of the `print('NO')` statement. It only affects the logical flow of the program, which is not shown in the provided snippet.
- Therefore, the `print('NO')` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **NO**
