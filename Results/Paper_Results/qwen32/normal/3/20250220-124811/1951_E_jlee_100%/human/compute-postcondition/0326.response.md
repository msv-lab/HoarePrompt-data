The given initial state describes several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables directly. The `print` statement is:

```python
print(1)
```

This statement will simply print the integer `1` regardless of the values of the other variables (`t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, `done`, `j`).

Thus, the output is:

Output: **1**
