Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `string` is the value of the input.
3. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
4. `n` is the length of `string`.
5. `done` is `False`.
6. `x` is the first character of `string`.
7. The count of `x` in `s` equals `n`, meaning every character in `s` is `x`.
8. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`, then `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.

### Key Observations:
- Since the count of `x` in `s` equals `n`, it means every character in `string` is the same as `x`.
- Therefore, `x` must be equal to the last character of `string` because every character in the string is `x`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`, or `x`. It simply prints `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
