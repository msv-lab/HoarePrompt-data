Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the new value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `count` is either 0 or greater than 0; `j` is 1; `done` is True.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `done` is set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
