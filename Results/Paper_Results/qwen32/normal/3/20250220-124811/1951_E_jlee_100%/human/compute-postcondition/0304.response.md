Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the new value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string`; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `count` is the index of the first character not equal to `x` in the new `string`; `count2` is the count of characters equal to `x` after `count` in the new `string`; `done` is False; `j` is `n` (indicating all iterations are completed); `i` is 1; and `done` remains False. If `n` is equal to 1, the conditions described above hold without any further changes. Otherwise, the conditions described in the else part apply, but since there is no else part, the conditions remain as specified in the precondition.**
