Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines if it is possible to split the string into two non-empty parts such that the two parts are not identical and the concatenation of these parts in any order results in the original string. If such a split is possible, it prints "YES" followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting substrings. If no such split is possible, it prints "NO".**
