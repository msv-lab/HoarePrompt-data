The given `print` statement is `print(1)`. This statement is independent of the variables and objects described in the initial state. It directly prints the integer `1`.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the initial state for clarity:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `string` is the input value.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `done` is a boolean set to `False`.
- `x` is the first character of `string` and is not equal to the last character of `string`.

However, none of these variables or objects affect the `print(1)` statement, which simply outputs the number `1`.

Output: **1**
