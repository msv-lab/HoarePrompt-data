Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is 0; `i` is 0. If `count` is greater than 0, then `count2` is less than or equal to `count` and `done` is True. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` when `count` is greater than 0, then `count2` is 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, the values of `count2` and `done` remain unchanged.**
