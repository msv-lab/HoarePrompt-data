The code snippet only initializes the variable `done` to `False`. It does not affect the values of `t`, `string`, `s`, or `n`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `done` is `False`.**
