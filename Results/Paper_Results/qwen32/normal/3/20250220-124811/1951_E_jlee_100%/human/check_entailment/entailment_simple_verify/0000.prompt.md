You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider cases where the string can be partitioned into more than two parts, and where the string contains repeating characters in a way that prevents a simple two-part partition from being a valid solution.

Let's consider a few edge cases:

1. **Case with repeating characters but possible partition:**
   - Input: `aaabaa`
   - Expected Output: `YES\n3\naaa b a`
   - The program will output `NO` because it does not attempt to partition the string into more than two parts if it cannot find a suitable two-part partition.

2. **Case with a single character repeated multiple times:**
   - Input: `aaaa`
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - The program correctly outputs `NO` for this case, but it does not generalize well to other cases.

3. **Case with a single non-matching character in the middle:**
   - Input: `aba`
   - Expected Output: `YES\n3\na b a`
   - The program outputs `NO` because it does not attempt to partition the string into more than two parts.

4. **Case where the string can be partitioned into more than two parts:**
   - Input: `abacaba`
   - Expected Output: `YES\n3\naba c aba`
   - The program outputs `NO` because it does not attempt to partition the string into more than two parts.

The program needs to be modified to handle these cases by attempting to partition the string into more than two parts if necessary. The current implementation is too restrictive and does not cover all possible valid partitions.

Here is a corrected version of the program that handles these cases:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        parts = []
        start = 0
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if not is_palindrome(string[start:j]):
                parts.append(string[start:j])
                start = j
        if start < n:
            parts.append(string[start:])
        if len(parts) > 1 and all(not is_palindrome(part) for part in parts):
            print('YES')
            print(len(parts))
            print(' '.join(parts))
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version attempts to partition the string into the smallest number of non-palindromic substrings and checks if all parts are non-palindromic. If it finds a valid partition, it prints the result; otherwise, it prints `NO`.
