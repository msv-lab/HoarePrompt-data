The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in this context, there is no loop present, so the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the flow of the program. Therefore, none of the variables will be changed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input with a length of 1; `s` is a list of characters from `string` containing exactly one character; `n` is the length of `string` and is equal to 1; `done` is `False`.**
