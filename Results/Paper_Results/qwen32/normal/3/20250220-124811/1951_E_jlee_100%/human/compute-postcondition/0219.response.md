Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is 0; `i` is 0; the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`. If `count2` is less than `count`, `count2` is less than `count` and `done` is True. If `count2` is equal to `count`, `count2` remains equal to `count` and `done` is True. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True.**
