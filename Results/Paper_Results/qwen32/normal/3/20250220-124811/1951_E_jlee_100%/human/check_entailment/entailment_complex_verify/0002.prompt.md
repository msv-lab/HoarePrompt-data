You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: All `t` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding outputs (either 'YES' or 'NO' along with the required indices and substrings if applicable) have been printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines if it is possible to split the string into two non-empty parts such that the two parts are not identical and the concatenation of these parts in any order results in the original string. If such a split is possible, it prints "YES" followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting substrings. If no such split is possible, it prints "NO".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
We need to partition a given string into substrings such that none of the substrings is a palindrome. If such a partition is possible, we need to print "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves. If it's not possible, we print "NO".

### Program Analysis

1. **Single Character Strings**: The program correctly identifies that a single character string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO".

2. **Checking Non-Palindrome Condition**:
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different, the string itself is non-palindromic, and the program correctly returns "YES" with the entire string as the partition.
   
3. **Uniform Strings**:
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the program correctly identifies that no partition can result in non-palindromic substrings, hence printing "NO".
   - If all but one character are the same and the string length is odd, the program correctly identifies that no partition can result in non-palindromic substrings, hence printing "NO".

4. **General Case**:
   - The program iterates through the string to find a point where the characters differ from the first character and the last character, indicating a potential non-palindromic partition.
   - If a non-palindromic partition is found, it prints "YES" and the partition.
   - However, the logic for handling cases where the string is nearly uniform (all but one character are the same) seems flawed. The program attempts to handle this but the logic is complex and not thoroughly tested by the example cases provided.

### Potential Issues
- The program's logic for handling cases where the string is nearly uniform (all but one character are the same) seems overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly.
- The logic for splitting the string into two parts where the first part ends at the first differing character from the first character and the last part starts from the last differing character from the last character is not entirely clear and may not cover all scenarios.

### Example Case Analysis
- For the string "lllllllll", the program correctly prints "NO" because all characters are the same.
- For the string "sinktheyacht", the program correctly prints "YES" and the entire string as the partition because it is non-palindromic.
- For the string "uwuowouwu", the program correctly prints "YES" and a valid partition such as "uw uow ouwu".

### Conclusion
While the program seems to handle some edge cases correctly, the logic for handling nearly uniform strings is complex and may not cover all scenarios. However, based on the provided examples, the program seems to work correctly.

Correctness: **True**

However, it's important to note that the program's logic for handling nearly uniform strings is complex and may need further testing for all edge cases.
