Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`. If all characters in `string` are `x` (i.e., `s.count(x) == n`), the conditions regarding the count of `x` in `s` and other variables remain as in the precondition. Otherwise, if `n` is 1, the conditions regarding the count of `x` in `s` and other variables remain as in the precondition. If `n` is greater than 1 and `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the conditions regarding the count of `x` in `s` and other variables remain as in the precondition. If `n` is odd and `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the middle character of `string` is not equal to `x` if `done` is False. If `s.count(x) != n - 1`, no changes are made to the variables. `count` is 0; `count2` is 0; `done` is False; `j` is `n` (indicating all iterations are completed); `i` is 0. Additionally, if `x` is not equal to the last character of `string`, the conditions remain as described. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is 0; `i` is 0. If `count` is greater than 0, then `count2` is less than or equal to `count` and `done` is True. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` when `count` is greater than 0, then `count2` is 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, the values of `count2` and `done` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is 1; `i` is 0. If `count` is greater than 0, then `count2` is less than or equal to `count` and `done` is True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is equal to `count`, `done` is True if `count` is greater than 1, and `count2` is set to 0 if `count` is not greater than 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, the values of `count2` and `done` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is 2; `i` is 0. If `count` is greater than 0, then if `count2` is less than `count`, `done`, `count`, and `count2` remain unchanged. If `count2` equals `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True. Otherwise, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, then the values of `count`, `count2`, and `done` remain unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
