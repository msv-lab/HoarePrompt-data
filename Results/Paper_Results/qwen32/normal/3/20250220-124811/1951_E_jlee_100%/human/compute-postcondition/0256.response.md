Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is 1; `i` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, the loop or if statement is broken out of and `done` is True. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, the values of `count2` and `done` remain unchanged. If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is less than or equal to `count` and `done` is True. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` when `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True and the loop or if statement is broken out of. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is equal to `count`, `done` is True if `count` is greater than 1, and `count2` is set to 0 if `count` is not greater than 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1.**
