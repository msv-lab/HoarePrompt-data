Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `string` is the new value of the input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0; `j` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains False. Additionally, if the first character `x` is not equal to the last character of the `string`, the condition `x != s[-1]` holds true. If `s.count(x) == n`, then all characters in `s` are equal to `x`. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, then `n` is odd and the middle character `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is not equal to `x`.**

This postcondition captures the state of the variables after the if statement, considering the conditions provided in the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only reflects the changes made when the if condition is true.
