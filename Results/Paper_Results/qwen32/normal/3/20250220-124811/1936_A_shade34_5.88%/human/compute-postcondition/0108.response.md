The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `mak` and `mak2` remain the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` is an empty list if `s` is not equal to '<', `n` is greater than 0, and `s` is the input string.

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1. The values of `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, `n`, and `s` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` is an empty list if `s` is not equal to '<', `n` is greater than 0, and `s` is the input string, `i` is incremented by 1**
