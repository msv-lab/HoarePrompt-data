The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given that `i` is 4, `pans` will now include 4 in its list. The other variables (`mak`, `mak2`, `n`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is `i` if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `pans` is a list containing the value `i` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list, and now `pans` is `[4]`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the new string input provided by the user; `i` is 4.**
