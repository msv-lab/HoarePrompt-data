`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is the last index `i` for which the input was `'>'`, or 0 if no `'>'` was ever input; `mak2` remains the initial value; `pans` remains the initial value; `n` is an input integer**.
