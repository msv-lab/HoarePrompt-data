The provided code snippet only contains `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is a method used to flush the output buffer. This operation does not affect the values of any variables or the state of the program in terms of variable values. Therefore, none of the variables `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, or `n` are altered by this code.

Output State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received, `pans` contains at least two elements, `n` remains unchanged**.
