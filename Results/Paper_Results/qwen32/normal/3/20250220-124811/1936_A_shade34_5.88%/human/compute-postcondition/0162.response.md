Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `mak` is `i + 1` if the input string is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains `i`.
- `mak2` and `pans` remain their initial values (not relevant for the print statement).
- `i` is incremented by 2 (`i = i + 2`).
- `n` is greater than `i` (not directly relevant for the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `mak`:**
   - If the input string is `'<'`, `mak` is set to `i + 1`.
   - If the input string is not `'<'`, `mak` remains `i`.
   
2. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is incremented by 2 before the print statement.

### Output Breakdown:
- The print statement outputs a string starting with `?`.
- It then prints `mak` twice.
- It then prints `i` twice.

Let's consider both scenarios for `mak`:

#### Scenario 1: Input string is `'<'`
- `mak` is set to `i + 1`.
- `i` is then incremented by 2, so the final value of `i` is `i + 2`.
- Therefore, `mak` is `i + 1` and `i` is `i + 2`.

#### Scenario 2: Input string is not `'<'`
- `mak` remains `i`.
- `i` is then incremented by 2, so the final value of `i` is `i + 2`.
- Therefore, `mak` is `i` and `i` is `i + 2`.

### Final Output:
- If the input string is `'<'`, the output will be `? i+1 i+1 i+2 i+2`.
- If the input string is not `'<'`, the output will be `? i i i+2 i+2`.

Since the exact input string is not provided, we can't determine definitively whether `mak` is `i + 1` or `i`. However, we can describe the output based on both scenarios.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] (where [mak] is i+1 if the input string is '<', otherwise i, and [i] is i+2)**
