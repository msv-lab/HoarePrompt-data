Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations prior to this; `pans` is a list containing the value `i`; `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is the string input provided by the user and its current value is `'<'`.**

In simple terms, the list `pans` now contains the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
