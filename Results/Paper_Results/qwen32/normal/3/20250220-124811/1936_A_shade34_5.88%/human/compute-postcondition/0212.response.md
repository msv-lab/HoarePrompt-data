The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range it iterates over, which is `len(pans)`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

From the problem statement:
- `mak` is `i` if the current input is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0.
- `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received.
- `pans` contains at least two elements.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that the loop iterates over `range(1, len(pans))`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to the next value within this range.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `i` should be set to the next integer value in the sequence.

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0; `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received; `pans` contains at least two elements; `n` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1 to the next value in the range, so `i` is now 2.**

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop starts with `i` being 1 (from the range `range(1, len(pans))`), the next value for `i` should be 2.

State: **`mak` is `i` if the current input is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0; `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received; `pans` contains at least two elements; `n` remains unchanged; `i` is 2.**
