The code provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output. This operation does not change any of the variables in the program; it only ensures that all the buffered output is written to the standard output immediately.

Given the initial state and the operation performed, the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `pans` is `[i]` if `s` is equal to '<', otherwise `pans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
