Postcondition: **`mak` is `i` if `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations; `pans` is a list containing the value `i` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list, and if `s` is `'='`, `pans` is now `[4]`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the new string input provided by the user; `i` is 4.**
