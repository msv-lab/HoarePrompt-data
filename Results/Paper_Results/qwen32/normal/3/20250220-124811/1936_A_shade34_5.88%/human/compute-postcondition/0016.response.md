The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written to the standard output immediately. However, it does not affect the values of any variables.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged by this command. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `i` has already been incremented by 1 as per the precondition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
