The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. However, the value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `mak` after the assignment. The other variables `mak2`, `pans`, and the input provided remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is the value of `i`; `mak2` remains the initial value; `pans` contains at least 2 elements; the input provided is `'>'`.**
