To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **mak**: It is set to `i` if the current input is `<`, otherwise it remains `0`. Since we do not have information about the current input, we consider both possibilities:
   - If the current input is `<`, `mak` is `i`.
   - If the current input is not `<`, `mak` is `0`.

2. **mak2**: It is explicitly set to `0`.

3. **pans**: It is a list of all indices where `s` was `=`. The value of `pans` is not directly relevant to the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

4. **n**: It is given that `n` is greater than `i + 1`. This condition does not directly affect the values of `mak`, `mak2`, or `i` in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it as well.

5. **i**: It is explicitly set to `i + 1`.

Given these points, let's construct the output string:

- The first value printed is a literal `?`.
- The second and third values are both `mak`. Since `mak` can be either `i` or `0` depending on the input, we need to consider both possibilities.
- The fourth and fifth values are both `i`, which is explicitly set to `i + 1`.

Let's break down the two possible scenarios for `mak`:

### Scenario 1: Current input is `<`
- `mak` is `i`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

So, the output would be: `?, i, i, i + 1, i + 1`.

### Scenario 2: Current input is not `<`
- `mak` is `0`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

So, the output would be: `?, 0, 0, i + 1, i + 1`.

Since we don't have information about the current input, we must consider both possibilities. However, we can provide a general form that covers both scenarios.

Output: **?, mak, mak, i + 1, i + 1 (where mak is i if the current input is '<', otherwise mak is 0)**
