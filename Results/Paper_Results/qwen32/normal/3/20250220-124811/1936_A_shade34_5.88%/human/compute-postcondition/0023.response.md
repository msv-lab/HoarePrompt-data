To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` based on the provided initial state. However, the initial state does not explicitly define the values of `mak`, `mak2`, or `i`. Therefore, we can only provide a description of what the output will look like in terms of these variables.

Here is the print statement:
```
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

The print statement will output a string with the literal character `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again.

Since the exact values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where [mak], [mak2], and [i] are the values of the variables mak, mak2, and i respectively)**
