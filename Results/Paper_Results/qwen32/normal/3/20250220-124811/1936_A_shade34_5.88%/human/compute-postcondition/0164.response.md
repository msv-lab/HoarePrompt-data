The code snippet `mak = i` directly assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. This means that the previous conditional assignment of `mak` based on the input string (`'<'` or otherwise) is overridden by the new assignment. The values of `mak2` and `pans` remain unchanged as per the problem statement. The value of `i` is already defined as `i + 2` in the Initial State, so `mak` will now hold this value. The condition `n > i` remains valid as it was in the initial state.

Output State: **`mak` is `i + 2`; `mak2` and `pans` remain their initial values; `i` is `i + 2`; `n` is greater than `i`.**
