The given code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the output buffer, but it does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is `len(pans) - 2` if the input is `'>'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0; `mak2` is 0; `pans` is a list of all indices where `s` was '=' and must have at least 2 elements; `n` remains unchanged; `i` is `len(pans) - 1`**.
