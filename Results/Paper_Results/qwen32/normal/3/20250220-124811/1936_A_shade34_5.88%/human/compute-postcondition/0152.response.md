The provided code snippet includes a call to `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This action does not change the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` remains the initial value, `pans` remains the initial value, `n` must be greater than 1**.
