To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the variables and their values based on the provided initial state.

### Analysis of Variables:
1. **mak**: 
   - `mak` is set to `i` if the current input is '>', otherwise it remains 0.
   - Without knowing the current input, we can assume two scenarios:
     - If the current input is '>', `mak` is `i`.
     - If the current input is not '>', `mak` is 0.

2. **mak2**: 
   - `mak2` is the last index `i` for which the input was '<', or `n-1` if no '<' was received.
   - The value of `mak2` does not affect the `print` statement directly, so we can ignore it for this analysis.

3. **pans**:
   - `pans` contains at least two elements.
   - We do not know the specific values of the elements in `pans`, but we know it has at least two elements.

4. **n**:
   - `n` remains unchanged and represents the total number of elements in `pans`.

5. **i**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so we need to know its previous value to determine its current value.
   - Without knowing the previous value of `i`, we can denote its current value as `i`.

### Determining the Values:
- `pans[mak]`:
  - If `mak` is `i` (when the current input is '>'), `pans[mak]` is `pans[i]`.
  - If `mak` is 0 (when the current input is not '>'), `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.

- `pans[i]`:
  - This is the element at index `i` in the list `pans`.

### Printing Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```
- The first element to be printed is `'?'`.
- The second and third elements are `pans[mak]`.
- The fourth and fifth elements are `pans[i]`.

### Output Scenarios:
- If the current input is '>', `mak` is `i`, so the output will be:
  ```
  '?', pans[i], pans[i], pans[i], pans[i]
  ```
- If the current input is not '>', `mak` is 0, so the output will be:
  ```
  '?', pans[0], pans[0], pans[i], pans[i]
  ```

### Final Output:
Since we do not have the exact value of `i` or the elements in `pans`, we describe the output based on the conditions:

Output: **? [pans[i], pans[i], pans[i], pans[i]] if the current input is '>', otherwise ? [pans[0], pans[0], pans[i], pans[i]] (where pans is the list containing at least two elements and i is the current index)**
