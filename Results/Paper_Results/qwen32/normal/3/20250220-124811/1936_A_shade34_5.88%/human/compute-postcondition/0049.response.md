Output State: **`s` is the new string input by the user, `mak` is 4 if `s` was initially '<' or '=', otherwise `mak` remains unchanged, `pans` is `[4]` if `s` was initially '<', includes the value of `i` at the end of its current contents if `s` was initially '=', otherwise `pans` includes the value of `i` at the end of its current contents, `i` is 5, and `n` must be greater than 5.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Therefore, if `pans` was initially `[4]` (when `s` was '<'), it becomes `[4, 5]`. If `pans` initially included `i` (when `s` was '='), it becomes `[value of i, 5]`. If `pans` remained unchanged (when `s` was neither '<' nor '='), it becomes `[5]`. The values of `s`, `mak`, `i`, and the condition for `n` remain the same.
