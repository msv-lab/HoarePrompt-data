To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **mak**: This variable is defined as the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations.
2. **mak2**: This variable is defined in the same way as `mak`; it is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations.
3. **pans**: This is an empty list, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
4. **i**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the `print` statement. Since `mak` and `mak2` are defined based on the value of `i`, we can infer that `i` must have a value at the time of the `print` statement.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```
We need to determine the values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`.

- Since `mak` and `mak2` are defined in the same way and are used in the same context, they will have the same value.
- The value of `mak` (and `mak2`) will be the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations.
- The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the `print` statement. The value of `i` at the time of the `print` statement could be any value that was assigned to it during the iterations, but it is not specified in the initial state.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` or the specific iterations and inputs, we can only describe the output in terms of the definitions provided.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] (where mak and mak2 are the last value of i for which the input was '<', or n-1 if the input was '<' for all iterations, and i is the value of i at the time of the print statement)**
