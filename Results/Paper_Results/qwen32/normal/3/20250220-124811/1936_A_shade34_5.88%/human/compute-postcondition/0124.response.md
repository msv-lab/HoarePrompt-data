Postcondition: **`mak` is the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<', `mak2` remains the maximum value of `i` for which the input was '<'. If the previous `s` was equal to '<', `pans` is `[i]`; otherwise, `pans` has the previous elements plus the new `i` if `s` is not '='. `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `s` is '=', `pans` remains unchanged from its state before the if statement.**
