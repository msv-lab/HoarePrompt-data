To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed. This is a system call to flush the output buffer, but it doesn't affect the variables or the print statement directly.
2. `s` is the string input by the user.
3. `mak` is set to 4 if `s` was initially '<' or '=', otherwise `mak` remains unchanged.
4. `pans` is `[4]` if `s` was initially '<', includes the value of `i` at the end of its current contents if `s` was initially '=', otherwise no changes are made to `pans`.
5. `i` is 5.
6. `n` must be greater than 5.

### Key Points to Note:
- The print statement is `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`.
- `mak2` is not mentioned or defined in the initial state. This implies that `mak2` is either an undefined variable, or it was defined elsewhere in the code which is not provided here. Since it is not defined in the given initial state, we will assume it is undefined.

### Determining the Output:
- The first part of the print statement is a literal character `?`.
- `mak` will be 4 if `s` was initially '<' or '=', otherwise it remains unchanged. However, since the initial value of `mak` is not provided, we assume it is set based on the condition involving `s`. For the sake of this explanation, let's consider all possible cases:
  - If `s` was initially '<' or '=', `mak` will be 4.
  - If `s` was neither '<' nor '=', `mak` remains its initial value (which is not specified, but we will assume it is set based on the condition).
- `mak2` is undefined in the given initial state, so it will raise a `NameError` when the print statement is executed.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 5.
- The second `mak2` in the print statement will also raise a `NameError` for the same reason as the first `mak2`.

Given that `mak2` is undefined, the print statement will raise a `NameError`. However, to strictly adhere to the format and provide the most precise description possible based on the given information, we will describe the output as it would be if `mak2` were defined.

### Assuming `mak2` were defined:
- If `mak2` were defined to be a specific value, let's denote it as `mak2_value`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state, the output would be:

- If `s` was initially '<' or '=', `mak` would be 4.
- If `s` was neither '<' nor '=', `mak` remains its initial value (unknown in this context).
- `mak2` is undefined, so the print statement would raise a `NameError`.

Since `mak2` is undefined, the actual execution would result in a `NameError`. However, for the sake of the format:

Output: **? 4 mak2 5 mak2 (where mak is 4 if s was initially '<' or '=', otherwise it remains its initial value, and mak2 is undefined)**

But strictly following the given format and assuming `mak2` were defined, the output would be:

Output: **? 4 mak2_value 5 mak2_value (where mak is 4 if s was initially '<' or '=', otherwise it remains its initial value, and mak2_value is the value of mak2)**

Since `mak2` is undefined, the actual output would be a `NameError`. However, for the given task format:

Output: **? 4 mak2 5 mak2 (where mak is 4 if s was initially '<' or '=', otherwise it remains its initial value, and mak2 is undefined)**
