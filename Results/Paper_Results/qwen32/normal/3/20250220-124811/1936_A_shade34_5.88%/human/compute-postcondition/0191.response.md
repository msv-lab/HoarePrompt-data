To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the variables are defined:

1. **mak**: This variable is defined as 4 if `s` is `'<'`. Otherwise, it is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations.
2. **mak2**: Similar to `mak`, this variable is also the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations.
3. **pans**: This variable is a list that contains the value 4 if `s` is `'<'`, the value `i` if `s` is `'='`, or an empty list if `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`.
4. **n**: This variable is greater than 0.
5. **s**: This is the new string input provided by the user.
6. **i**: This variable is set to 5.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we need to consider the possible scenarios for `s`:

- If `s` is `'<'`:
  - `mak` would be 4.
  - `mak2` would be 4 (assuming `i` was 4 in the last iteration where `s` was `'<'`).
  
- If `s` is `'='`:
  - `mak` would be the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations.
  - `mak2` would be the same as `mak`.
  - `pans` would contain the value `i` (which is 5 in this case).

- If `s` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`:
  - `mak` would be the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'`, or `n-1` if the input was `'<'` for all iterations.
  - `mak2` would be the same as `mak`.
  - `pans` would be an empty list.

However, the print statement does not involve `pans`, so we only need to consider `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`.

Given that `i` is 5, and without knowing the exact value of `s`, we can only provide the most general answer:

- If `s` is `'<'`, `mak` and `mak2` would be 4.
- If `s` is not `'<'`, `mak` and `mak2` would be the last value of `i` for which `s` was `'<'`, or `n-1` if `s` was `'<'` for all iterations.

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we assume the most likely scenario based on the given information, which is that `mak` and `mak2` could be 4 if `s` is `'<'`. If `s` is not `'<'`, we cannot determine the exact value of `mak` and `mak2` without more information, but we can describe it as the last value of `i` for which `s` was `'<'`, or `n-1` if `s` was `'<'` for all iterations.

Thus, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **? 4 4 5 4 (assuming s is '<')** or **? [mak] [mak2] 5 [mak2] (where mak and mak2 are the last value of i for which s was '<', or n-1 if s was '<' for all iterations)**

Since we need to provide the most precise description based on the given information, we assume the most likely scenario:

Output: **? 4 4 5 4 (assuming s is '<')**
