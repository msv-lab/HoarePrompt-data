Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand; `string` is an input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `done` is `False`; `x` is the first character of `string`. The count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n - 1`. Additionally, either `n` is even, or `n` is odd and the character at the middle index \((n - 1) // 2\) of `s` is equal to `x`.**
