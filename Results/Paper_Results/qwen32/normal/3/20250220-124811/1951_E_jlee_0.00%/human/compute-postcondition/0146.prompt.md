Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand; `string` is an input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `done` is `False`; `x` is the first character of `string`. If all characters in `s` are equal to `x`, then `s.count(x) == n`. Otherwise, `s.count(x) != n`. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, then either `n` is even, or `n` is odd and the character at the middle index \((n - 1) // 2\) of `s` is equal to `x`. `count` is 0; `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable; `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `count2` is 0 unless `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, in which case `count2` is set to 1; `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `count > 0` and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and (`count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1, or `count` is equal to 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`). If `count` is 0, `done` remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is the loop variable; `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `string`; `x` is the first character of `string`. If `count` is greater than 0, then if `s[j] != x`, `count` is set to `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count2` equals `count`, `done` is `True` if `count > 1`, and `count2` is 0 if `count > 1`. If `count2` does not equal `count` and `count2` is not greater than `count`, `done` remains `False`. If `s[j] == x`, then `count2` is set to 1 if it was 0, or 2 if it was 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains `False`. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count`, `count2`, or `done`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable, `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `count` and `count2` are integers, `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1. If `count` is greater than 0, the program checks conditions related to `s[j]`, `x`, `count`, and `count2` to potentially set `done` to True. If `count` is not greater than 0, no additional changes are made to `done`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
