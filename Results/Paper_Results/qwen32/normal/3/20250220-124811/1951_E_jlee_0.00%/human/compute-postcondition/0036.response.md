Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is the loop variable (though it's not used in the given print statement).
- `string` is an input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `done` is `False`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- `count` is 0.
- `count2` is 0.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` (this indicates that `string` is not a palindrome).

### Print Statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided to be printed.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
