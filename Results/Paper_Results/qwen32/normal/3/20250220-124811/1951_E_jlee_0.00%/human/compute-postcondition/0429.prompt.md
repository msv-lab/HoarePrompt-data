Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `done` is False, `j` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `string` is the user input, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `string`, and `x` is the first character of `string`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `s.count(x) == n`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the conditions remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `done` is True if the character at position `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at position `n - 1 - j` in `s`. Otherwise, `done` remains False; `j` is -1; `count` is greater than 0 if the if condition is met, otherwise it remains unchanged; `count2` is 1 if the character at position `j` in `s` is equal to `x` and `count` is greater than 0, otherwise `count2` is either 0 (if `count` is 1) or equal to `count` (if `count` is greater than 1); `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `s.count(x) == n` or `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `count2` is a positive integer less than `count`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `done` is True if `count2` is a positive integer less than `count` or if the character at position `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at position `n - 1 - j` in `s`. Otherwise, `done` remains False. `j` is 0. `count` is 0 if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, otherwise `count` remains unchanged. `count2` is 1 if `count > 1` and the character at position `j` in `s` is equal to `x`, otherwise `count2` is `count2 + 1` if the character at position `j` in `s` is equal to `x` and `count` is greater than 0, otherwise `count2` remains unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. `string` is the user input. `s` is a list of characters from `string`. `n` must be at least 1. `x` is the first character of `string`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `s.count(x) == n` or `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the conditions remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `done` is set to True or if `count2` is a positive integer less than `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `done` is True if the character at position `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at position `n - 1 - j` in `s` or if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`. Otherwise, `done` remains False. `j` is 1. If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count` is set to 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. `count2` is 1 if `count > 1` and the character at position `j` in `s` is equal to `x`; otherwise, `count2` is `count2 + 1` if the character at position `j` in `s` is equal to `x` and `count` is greater than 0, otherwise `count2` remains unchanged if `s[j] != x`. `i` is incremented by 1. The conditions regarding `x` not equal to the last character of `s`, `s.count(x) == n` or `s.count(x) == n - 1`, and the middle character of `s` for odd `n` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `done` is set to True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
