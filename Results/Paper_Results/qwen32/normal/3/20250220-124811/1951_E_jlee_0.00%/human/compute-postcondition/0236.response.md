To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the logic described. Let's break down the provided information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (implying that `i` is some integer value before this iteration).
   - `string` is the new input string with length `n` where `n` is at least 1.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
   - `n` is the length of the new `string` and must be at least 1.
   - `x` is the first character of the new `string`.
   - `count` is set to `j` if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`.
   - `done` is set to `True` if `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`.
   - `count2` is incremented by 1 for each `s[j]` not equal to `x` if `count > 0`.
   - `done` is set to `True` if `count2` equals `count` (with specific conditions).
   - `done` is set to `True` if `count2` is greater than `count`.
   - `count2` is set to 1 if `s[j]` is equal to `x`.
   - `count` remains 0 if no conditions are met.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The logic described seems to be checking for certain conditions related to the characters in the string `string`.
   - The variable `done` is set to `True` under specific conditions, but the exact value of `done` is not directly relevant to the `print('YES')` statement.
   - The `print('YES')` statement is executed regardless of the conditions met in the logic. It will always print 'YES' as there are no conditional statements controlling its execution.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the structure of the code snippet, the `print('YES')` statement will execute and print 'YES' irrespective of the input string or the values of `count`, `count2`, or `done`.

Output: **YES**
