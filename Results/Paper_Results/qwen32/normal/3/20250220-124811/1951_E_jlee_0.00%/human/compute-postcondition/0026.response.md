Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is a loop variable and does not need to be set beforehand.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `string`.
- `done` is `False`.
- `x` is the first character of `string`.
- The count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n - 1`.
- Additionally, either `n` is even, or `n` is odd and the character at the middle index \((n - 1) // 2\) of `s` is equal to `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that will output the integer `1`. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `1` and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is straightforward and outputs the integer `1`, the output will be:

Output: **1**
