Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. If `n` equals 1, the list `a` contains exactly one integer. Otherwise, `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` starting from index `mdx` to `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.**
