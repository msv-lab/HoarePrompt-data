The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged except for `res`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, if `n` equals 1, the list `a` contains exactly one integer, otherwise, `res` is 1 if `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, otherwise `res` remains 0, `i` is `t`, `res` is incremented by 1**.

In simpler terms, the value of `res` is now `res + 1`, and all other variables retain their initial values.
