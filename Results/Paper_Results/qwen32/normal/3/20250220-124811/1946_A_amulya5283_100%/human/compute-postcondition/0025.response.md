The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `res`, `mdx`) remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and if `n` equals 1, the list `a` contains exactly one integer. Otherwise, `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` starting from index `mdx` to `n-1`.**
