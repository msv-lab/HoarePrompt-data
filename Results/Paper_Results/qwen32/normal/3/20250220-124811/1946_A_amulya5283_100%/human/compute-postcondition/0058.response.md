Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than `mdx + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `res` is 2 if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`; otherwise, `res` is 1, `i` is `mdx + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
