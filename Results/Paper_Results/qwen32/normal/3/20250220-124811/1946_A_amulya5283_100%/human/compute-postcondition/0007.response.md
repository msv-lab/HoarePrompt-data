The given initial state and the Python code snippet provide the following information:

- `n` is set to 1.
- `t` is an input integer with the constraint \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a sorted list containing exactly one integer, `a_1`, such that \(1 \leq a_1 \leq 10^9\).
- The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print(1)
```

The `print(1)` statement will print the integer `1` regardless of the values of `n`, `t`, or `a`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **1**
