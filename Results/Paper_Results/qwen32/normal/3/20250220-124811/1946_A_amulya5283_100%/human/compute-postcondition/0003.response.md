Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is reassigned to the value of the next input integer. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
