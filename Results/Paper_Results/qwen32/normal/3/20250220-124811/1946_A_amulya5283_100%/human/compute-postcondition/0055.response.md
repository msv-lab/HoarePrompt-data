Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `res` is 1, and the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`.**

In natural language: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, changing it from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
