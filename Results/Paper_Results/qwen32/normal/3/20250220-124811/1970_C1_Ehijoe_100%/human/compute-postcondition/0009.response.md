The code reads a pair of integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes`, or `i`. It only updates the values of `u` and `v` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` including `v` and now `nodes[v]` includes `u`; `i` is 1; `u` and `v` are integers read from the input.**
