The code snippet `nodes[v].append(u)` modifies the `nodes` dictionary by appending the value `u` to the list associated with the key `v`. This means that the adjacency list representation of the tree will now include an edge from `v` to `u`.

Given the initial state, the variable `nodes` is a `defaultdict` of lists. Initially, `nodes[v]` is an empty list because `edges` is an empty list. After executing the line of code, `nodes[v]` will contain the value `u` as its first (and currently only) element.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `u_1`, `edges`, `empty`, `i`, `u`, and `v`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` including `v` and now `nodes[v]` includes `u`; `i` is 0; `u` and `v` are integers read from the input.**
