The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5. After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with `nodes[u]` including `v` and now `nodes[v]` includes `u`; `i` is 1; `u` and `v` are integers read from the input.**
