Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u has a list of all its connected nodes v; `i` is n-1; `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `ends` is a list containing all leaf nodes of the tree; `s` is the first element of `ends`; `e` is the second element of `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the elements `s` and `curr`, and now also includes `curr` appended to it; `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][0]`; `prev` is updated to the previous value of `curr`; `curr` must be different from `e`; `prev` is now equal to `curr`.**

Natural language description: The value of `curr` is updated to the first element in the list `nodes[curr]`. The value of `prev` is updated to the previous value of `curr`. All other variables retain their initial values.
