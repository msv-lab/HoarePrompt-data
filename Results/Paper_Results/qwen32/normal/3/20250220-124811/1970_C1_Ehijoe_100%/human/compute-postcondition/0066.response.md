The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), an integer `t` (which is always 1), a list of `n-1` pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of a tree (where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n), and a single integer `u_1` representing the starting node of the stone (where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n). The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. 

The function returns a value based on the structure of the tree and the starting node of the stone. Since the exact return value is not specified in the given output description, we can infer that it likely returns some information about the tree or the path related to the starting node `u_1`.
