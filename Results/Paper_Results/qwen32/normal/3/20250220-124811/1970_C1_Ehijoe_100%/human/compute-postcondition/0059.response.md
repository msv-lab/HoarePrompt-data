The code snippet `idx = tree.index(start)` finds the index of the value `start` in the list `tree`. This operation does not change any existing variables except for introducing a new variable `idx` which holds the index of `start` in `tree`.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of `idx` with the value being the index of `start` in the list `tree`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u has a list of all its connected nodes v; `i` is n-1; `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `ends` is a list containing all leaf nodes of the tree; `s` is the first element of `ends`; `e` is the second element of `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the path from `s` to `e` with `e` appended at the end; `prev` is the node just before `e` in the path; `curr` is `e`; `start` is an input integer; `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**
