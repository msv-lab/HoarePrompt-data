The code snippet `ends.append(key)` appends the value of `key` to the list `ends`. This means the list `ends` will now include the value of `key` as one of its elements. No other variables are modified by this line of code.

Based on the initial state provided and the code snippet, the output state would be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; the next 0 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u has a list of all its connected nodes v, and `nodes` must contain at least one key-value pair (e.g., nodes[1] = [2]); `i` is n-1; `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input; if the current node `key` in `nodes` has exactly one connected node, then `ends` is a list containing the single element `key`; otherwise, `ends` remains an empty list; `key` is the next key in the `nodes` dictionary; `ends` is a list containing `key`.**
