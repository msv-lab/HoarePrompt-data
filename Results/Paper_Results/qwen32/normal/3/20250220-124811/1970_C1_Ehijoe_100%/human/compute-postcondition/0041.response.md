Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; the next 0 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n; the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists where each node u has a list of all its connected nodes v; `i` is n-1; `u` and `v` are the last pair of integers read from the input; `ends` is a list containing all leaf nodes of the tree; `s` is the first element of `ends`; `e` is the second element of `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the elements `s` and `curr`; if `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, then `prev` is set to `curr` and `curr` is set to `nodes[curr][0]`. Otherwise, `curr` is set to the second connected node to `s` in `nodes[s]` and `curr` must not be equal to `e`.**
