Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State Explanation:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1440 inclusive.
- `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time.
- `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time.
- `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time (note: `m` and `m1` are the same).
- `time` is a string that will be either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`.
- `h1` is a string representing the hour part in 12-hour format.

### Conditions for `h1` and `time`:
- If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '02' through '11', `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
- If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '13' through '23', `h1` is `h - 12` and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

### Output Determination:
The `print` statement concatenates `h1`, `':'`, `m`, `' '`, and `time` without any separators (due to `sep=''`).

Given the conditions:
- `h1` is determined by the value of `h` as described above.
- `m` is explicitly provided as a string.
- `time` is determined by the value of `h` as described above.

### Example Scenarios:
1. **If `h` is '01' and `m` is '30'**:
   - `h1` is '01'
   - `time` is 'AM'
   - Output: **01:30 AM**

2. **If `h` is '13' and `m` is '45'**:
   - `h1` is '01' (since '13' - '12' = '01')
   - `time` is 'PM'
   - Output: **01:45 PM**

3. **If `h` is '12' and `m` is '00'**:
   - `h1` is '12'
   - `time` is 'PM'
   - Output: **12:00 PM**

4. **If `h` is '00' and `m` is '15'**:
   - `h1` is '12'
   - `time` is 'AM'
   - Output: **12:15 AM**

### General Output:
The output will be in the format `h1:m time` where `h1` is the hour in 12-hour format, `m` is the minutes, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

### Final Answer:
Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the hour in 12-hour format, m is the minutes, and time is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of h)**
