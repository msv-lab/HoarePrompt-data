Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time. If `h` is '12', then `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '12'. If `h` is '13', then `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '01'. If `h` is '14', then `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '02'. If `h` is '15', then `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '03'. If `h` is '16', then `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '04'. If `h` is '17', then `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '05'. If `h` is '18', then `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '06'. If `h` is '19', then `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '07'. If `h` is '20', then `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '08'. If `h` is '21', then `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '09'. If `h` is '22', then `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '10'. If `h` is '23', then `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '11'. If `h` is '00', then `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '12'. For all other values of `h`, `time` and `h1` remain unchanged.**
