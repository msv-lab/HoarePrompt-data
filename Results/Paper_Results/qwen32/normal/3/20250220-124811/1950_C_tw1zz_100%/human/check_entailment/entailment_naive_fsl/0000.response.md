Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not handle the conversion of hours correctly for all edge cases. Specifically, it does not handle the conversion of hours that are not explicitly listed in the if-elif statements. For example, if the input is "15:30", the program will not correctly convert it to "03:30 PM" because there is no explicit handling for the hour "15". The program only correctly handles the hours from "00" to "23" through a series of if-elif statements, which is inefficient and error-prone. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the conversion of hours from "13" to "23" by subtracting 12 from the hour to convert it to the 12-hour format. 

A more efficient and correct approach would be to use modulo and conditional logic to handle the conversion of hours and the determination of AM/PM. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h12 = 12
            time = 'AM'
        elif h < 12:
            h12 = h
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            h12 = 12
            time = 'PM'
        else:
            h12 = h - 12
            time = 'PM'
        print(f"{h12:02}:{m:02} {time}")

```

This version correctly handles all edge cases and efficiently converts the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format.
