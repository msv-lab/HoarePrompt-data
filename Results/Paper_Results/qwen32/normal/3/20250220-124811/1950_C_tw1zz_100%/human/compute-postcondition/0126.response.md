Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, and `time` is a string. If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '02' through '11', then `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13' through '23', then `h1` is `h - 12` and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. For all other values of `h` that do not match the above conditions, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string. `h1` is an empty string, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time.**
