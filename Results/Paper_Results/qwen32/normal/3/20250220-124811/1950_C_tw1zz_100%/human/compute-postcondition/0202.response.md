The provided code snippet reads a time input in the format `h:m` and splits it into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute) as strings. The initial state of `h` and `m` is given as strings representing the hour and minute parts of the input time, respectively. The code does not affect the values of `t`, `h1`, `m1`, or the conditions for determining `time` and `h1`.

Output State: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h1` is a string representing the hour part of the input time adjusted to the 12-hour format, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, and `time` is a string indicating whether it is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`.**
