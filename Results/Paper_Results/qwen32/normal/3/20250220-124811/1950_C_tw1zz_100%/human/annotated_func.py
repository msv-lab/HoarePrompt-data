    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases, converting each 24-hour formatted time "hh:mm" into a 12-hour format "h1:mm AM/PM" and printing it.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a time in 24-hour format "hh:mm". It then converts this time into 12-hour format "h:mm AM/PM" and prints the result.
