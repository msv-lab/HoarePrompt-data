The code snippet assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The other variables (`t`, `h`, `m`, `m1`, `h1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `time` is `'PM'`, `h1` is `'09'`**.
