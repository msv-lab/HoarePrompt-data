Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time. If `h` is '06', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '06'. If `h` is '07', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '07'. If `h` is '08', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '08'. If `h` is '09', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '09'. If `h` is '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is adjusted accordingly ('10' to '10', '11' to '11', '12' to '12', '13' to '01', '14' to '02', '15' to '03', '16' to '04', '17' to '05', '18' to '06', '19' to '07', '20' to '08', '21' to '09', '22' to '10', '23' to '11'). If `h` is '00', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '12'. For all other values of `h`, `time` and `h1` remain unchanged.**
