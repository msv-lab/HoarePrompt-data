The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` (which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use) and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be at least 1, as the loop will iterate that many times.

In the given state, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and it represents the number of test cases. To ensure the loop executes, `int(input())` should return this value `t`. 

Since we are only allowed to adjust the objects in the loop head, we need to ensure that `int(input())` will return a value that is at least 1. Given the context, the value `t` already satisfies this condition (since 1 <= t <= 1440).

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `int(input())` will return `t`, which is already guaranteed to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and `int(input())` returns `t`**
