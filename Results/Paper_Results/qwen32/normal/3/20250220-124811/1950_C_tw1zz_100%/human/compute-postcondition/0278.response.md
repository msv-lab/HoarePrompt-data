Output State: **The loop has processed all `t` test cases, converting each 24-hour formatted time "hh:mm" into a 12-hour format "h1:mm AM/PM" and printing it.**

**Natural Language Explanation:**
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, each input time in the format "hh:mm" (where "hh" is the hour from "00" to "23" and "mm" is the minute from "00" to "59") has been converted into a 12-hour format. The hour "hh" is adjusted to "h1" (ranging from "01" to "12") and labeled with "AM" or "PM" accordingly. The minute "mm" remains unchanged. The loop has printed the converted time for each of the `t` test cases.
