The code snippet reads two input values and assigns them to `list_len` and `max_power`. The initial state specifies that `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values, respectively. After the execution of the code, the values of `list_len` and `max_power` will be updated to the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is an empty list, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is equal to `len(rev_val)` (which is 0), `rev_res` is an empty string, `y` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer value of the input provided**.
