Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is an empty list, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is equal to `len(rev_val)` (which is 0), `rev_res` is an empty string, `y` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer value of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the string `'0'`, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is 0, `x_rev` is 0, `rev_res` is either '0' or an empty string, `y` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer value of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is '0'. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the string `'0'` and `rev_res` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the string `'0'`, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, `y` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer value of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is `'0' + x` if `rev_res` was `'0'` or `x` if `rev_res` was an empty string. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the string `'0'` and `rev_res` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `list_len` is the first input value as a string, `max_power` is the second input value as a string, `x` is `next_x` (the next element in `operational_list`), `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `next_x`, `y` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer value of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `next_x`, then `rev_res` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains the string `'0'` and `rev_res` is an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
