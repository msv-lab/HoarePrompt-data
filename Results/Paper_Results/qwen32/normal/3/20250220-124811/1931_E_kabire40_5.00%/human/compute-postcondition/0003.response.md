The code snippet reads two values from the input and splits them into `list_len` and `max_power`. These values are read as strings and need to be converted to integers for further use.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and `rev_val` is an empty list; `rev_res` is an empty string; `list_len` is a string representing the first input value; `max_power` is a string representing the second input value.**

After execution, `list_len` and `max_power` will hold the string values from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.
