The only variable in the loop head is `x` from the `operational_list`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to reflect the start of the next iteration of the loop. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the current element from `operational_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be the next element in `operational_list`.

Since we do not have specific information about the current index of `x` in `operational_list`, we can infer that `x` was the `k-th` element in the list during the previous iteration. Therefore, in the next iteration, `x` should be the `(k+1)-th` element.

However, we do not have the specific value of `k`, but we know that `operational_list` must contain at least one string, and the loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `operational_list`.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is an empty list, `list_len` is a string representing the first input value, `max_power` is a string representing the second input value, and `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least one string. `x` is the next element in `operational_list`**
