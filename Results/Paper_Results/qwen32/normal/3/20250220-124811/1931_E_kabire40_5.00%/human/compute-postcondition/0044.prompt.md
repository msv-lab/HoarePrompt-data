Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is a sorted list of strings where each string is the reversed version of an element from `operational_list` that introduces leading zeros, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of elements from `operational_list` where reversing the element does not introduce leading zeros, `list_len` is a string representing the first input value, and `max_power` is a string representing the second input value.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is a sorted list of strings with at least one string, `list_len` is a string representing the first input value, and `max_power` is a string representing the second input value. `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of elements from `operational_list` where reversing the element does not introduce leading zeros, plus the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the reverse of `val_in` if `x` is odd. `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is even, or the string at index `x` in `rev_val` if `x` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is a sorted list of strings with at least one string, `list_len` is a string representing the first input value, `max_power` is a string representing the second input value, `x` is incremented by 1. If `x` is even, `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]` and `rev_res` is updated to include the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is odd, `val_in` is `rev_val[x]` and `rev_res` is updated to include the reverse of `rev_val[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `rev_val` is a sorted list of strings with at least one string, `list_len` is a string representing the first input value, `max_power` is a string representing the second input value, `x` is 4. If `x` is even, `val_in` is set to `int(rev_val[4])` and `rev_res` is updated to include the string representation of `val_in`. Otherwise, `val_in` is set to `rev_val[4]` and `rev_res` is updated to include the reverse of `rev_val[4]` appended to its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
