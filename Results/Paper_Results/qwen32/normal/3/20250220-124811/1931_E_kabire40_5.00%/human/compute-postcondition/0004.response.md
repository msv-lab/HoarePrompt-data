Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and `rev_val` is an empty list; `rev_res` is an empty string; `list_len` is a string representing the first input value; `max_power` is a string representing the second input value; `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to `operational_list`. All other variables remain unchanged.
