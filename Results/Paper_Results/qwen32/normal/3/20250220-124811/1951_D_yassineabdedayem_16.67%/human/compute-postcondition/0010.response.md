Given the initial state and the code snippet, we can determine the output state by focusing on the changes made to the variables. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

- `k` is initially a positive integer such that `k <= n`.
- `Max` is initially equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.
- The code snippet modifies `k` by subtracting `Max` from it.

Since `Max` is equal to `k`, the operation `k = k - Max` results in `k = k - k`, which means `k` will be `0`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`) are not modified by the code snippet and thus remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer; `k` is 0; `rep` is 0; `number` is `Min`; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` is min(n // k, k); `Max` is max(int(n / k), k); `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**
