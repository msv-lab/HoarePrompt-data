The value of `number` is updated to the value of `Max`, which is 3. Other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k` is still valid.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 5, `k` is 3, `rep` is 0, `tab` is `[]`, `number` is 3, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 3, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**
