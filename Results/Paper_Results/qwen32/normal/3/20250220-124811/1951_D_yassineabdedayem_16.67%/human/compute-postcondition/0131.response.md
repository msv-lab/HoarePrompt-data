The code snippet reassigns the values of `Min` and `Max` using the same expressions that were used in their initial assignment. Since the expressions do not change, the values of `Min` and `Max` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is `k + 1`, `rep` is `2`, `tab` is `['number', str(number)]`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `rep`, and `tab` remain unchanged. The values of `Min` and `Max` are recalculated using the same expressions, so they remain the same as well.
