To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the given states:

The loop iterates over each element in the list `tab` and prints the element followed by a space. The initial state and the output states after the first few iterations indicate that `tab` has at least three elements and the loop has printed the first three elements.

The loop head is:
```python
for i in tab:
    print(i, end=' ')
```

Since `tab` is a list of string representations of numbers, and the loop has printed the first three elements after three iterations, we can infer that `tab` has at least three elements. The loop will continue to iterate over the remaining elements in `tab` until all elements are printed.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first few iterations, we can determine that `tab` has `rep` elements (where `rep` is the number of iterations and is less than 60). Since the loop has already printed the first three elements, it will print the remaining `rep - 3` elements in subsequent iterations.

Therefore, after all iterations, the loop will have printed all elements in `tab`. The state of the variables will be as follows:

- `t` remains `t`.
- `n` remains 0 or less than `k`.
- `k` remains 0.
- `rep` remains the number of iterations (less than 60).
- `tab` remains a list of string representations of numbers.
- `number` remains the last number calculated (which is the last element in `tab`).

The loop variable `i` will not be defined outside the loop after the loop finishes executing.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

Output State: **`t` is t, `n` is 0 or less than `k`, `k` is 0, `rep` is the number of iterations (less than 60), `tab` is a list of string representations of numbers, `number` is the last number calculated.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `t` retains its initial value, `n` remains 0 or less than `k`, `k` stays 0, `rep` keeps its initial value representing the number of iterations, `tab` still contains the list of string representations of numbers, and `number` is the last number in the list `tab`.
