The code snippet `n -= Min * Max` modifies the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`. `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` and `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. The value of `n` is updated as per the operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is either `0` or `k - min(n // k, k)`, `rep` is `0`, `tab` is `['number']`, `number` is either `1` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is `0` and `number` is `1`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)` and `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

In natural language: The value of `n` is reduced by the product of `Min` and `Max`. All other variables retain their initial values unless further operations affect them.
