To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop head: `n != 0`, `k > 0`, `rep < 60`, and `n >= k`.

Here's the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `t`
- `n` is `n - Min * Max`
- `k` is either `0` or `k - min(n // k, k)`
- `rep` is `1`
- `tab` is `['number']`
- `number` is either `1` or `max(int(n / k), k)`
- `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`
- `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`
- If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is `0` and `number` is `1`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)` and `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`

Let's analyze each condition:

1. **`n != 0`**: 
   - `n` is `n - Min * Max`. For `n` to be non-zero, `n - Min * Max` must not be zero. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n - Min * Max` is not zero.

2. **`k > 0`**: 
   - `k` is either `0` or `k - min(n // k, k)`. For `k` to be greater than zero, it must be `k - min(n // k, k)` and not `0`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k - min(n // k, k)` is greater than zero.

3. **`rep < 60`**: 
   - `rep` is `1`. Since `1 < 60`, this condition is already satisfied. No adjustment is needed for `rep`.

4. **`n >= k`**: 
   - `n` is `n - Min * Max` and `k` is either `0` or `k - min(n // k, k)`. For `n >= k` to hold, `n - Min * Max` must be greater than or equal to `k - min(n // k, k)`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that:
- `n - Min * Max` is not zero.
- `k - min(n // k, k)` is greater than zero.
- `n - Min * Max` is greater than or equal to `k - min(n // k, k)`.

Since `rep` is already `1` and satisfies `rep < 60`, we do not need to adjust it.

State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is `n - Min * Max` (where `n - Min * Max` is not zero), `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)` (where `k - min(n // k, k)` is greater than zero), `rep` is `1`, `tab` is `['number']`, `number` is either `1` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**

This ensures that all conditions in the `while` loop head are satisfied for the loop to execute one more time.
