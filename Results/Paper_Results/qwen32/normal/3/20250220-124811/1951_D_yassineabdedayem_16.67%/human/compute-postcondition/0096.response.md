Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t is t-1`: This line seems to be an incorrect or incomplete statement as it does not define `t` properly. We will assume `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `n is 0`: This defines `n` as 0.
- `k is 0`: This defines `k` as 0.
- `rep is 3`: This defines `rep` as 3.
- `tab is ['3', '2', '1']`: This defines `tab` as a list containing the strings '3', '2', and '1'.
- `number is 1`: This defines `number` as 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is trying to print the variable `i`.
- However, `i` is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, this code would normally result in a `NameError` because `i` is not defined.

Since `i` is not defined, the code as provided would raise an error. However, if we assume that `i` is supposed to be defined somewhere in the code that is not provided (and based on typical scenarios, `i` could be an index or a loop counter), we can't determine its value from the given information.

Given the information provided and the lack of definition for `i`, the most precise description we can provide is that the code would raise an error. However, if we are to strictly adhere to the task and provide an output based on the given details:

Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**

But if we hypothetically assume that `i` was meant to be defined somewhere (say, from a loop or another part of the code), we cannot determine its value from the given information. Therefore, the most precise answer based on the task format would be:

Output: **i (where i is a variable that is not defined in the provided initial state)**

However, typically in such scenarios, the code would fail to execute due to the undefined variable. So, the most likely outcome is the error message.
