Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 5, `k` is 3, `rep` is 0, `tab` is `[]`, `number` is 1, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 3. `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `number` has been updated to 1, which is the value of `Min`. All other variables retain their initial values, and the preconditions `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k` remain valid.
