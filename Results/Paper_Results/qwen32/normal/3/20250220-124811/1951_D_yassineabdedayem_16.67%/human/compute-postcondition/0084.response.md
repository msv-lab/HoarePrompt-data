Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `rep` is 2, `tab` is either `['1', '1']` or `['3', '2']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is `n`, `k` is `0`, `number` is `n`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`, which means `k` becomes `1 - 1` = `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
