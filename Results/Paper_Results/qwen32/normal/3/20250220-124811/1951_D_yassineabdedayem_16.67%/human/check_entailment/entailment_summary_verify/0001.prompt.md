You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it attempts to reduce `k` to zero by repeatedly subtracting the product of two derived values from `n`. If `k` is reduced to zero, it outputs 'YES', the number of steps taken, and the sequence of values used in the reduction. If `k` cannot be reduced to zero, it outputs 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding:
Bob has to set up his jewelry store with at most 60 stalls. Each stall has a price per jewel, and Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from each stall in sequence until she has bought exactly `k` jewels. The goal is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels without exceeding the 60 stall limit.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n` (Alice's coins) and `k` (the number of jewels Alice needs to buy).
2. **Main Logic**:
   - It initializes `rep` (representing the number of stalls set up), `number` (the price per jewel for the current stall), and `tab` (a list to store the prices).
   - It enters a loop that continues until `n` (Alice's remaining coins) becomes 0, `k` (remaining jewels to buy) becomes 0, the number of stalls (`rep`) reaches 60, or `n` is less than `k`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `Min` and `Max` based on `n // k` and `n / k` respectively.
   - Depending on the values of `Min` and `Max`, it sets `number` to either `Min` or `Max` and adjusts `k` and `n` accordingly.
   - It appends the price for the current stall to `tab`.
3. **Output**:
   - If `k` becomes 0, it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices.
   - If the loop exits without `k` becoming 0, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program:
The main issue with the program is that it doesn't guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The logic for setting the prices (`number`) and adjusting `k` and `n` is flawed and doesn't correctly simulate the greedy behavior of Alice.

### Correct Approach:
To ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, we can use a simpler strategy:
- Use binary representation of `k` to determine the number of stalls.
- Set the price at each stall to a power of 2 such that the sum of the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall equals `k`.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
