Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    rep = 0
    number = 0
    tab = []
    while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
        Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
        if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
            number = Min
            k = k - Max
        else:
            number = Max
            k = k - Min
        tab.append(str(number))
        n -= Min * Max
        rep += 1
    if k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(tab))
        for i in tab:
            print(i, end=' ')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is 0 or a value less than `k`; `k` is either 0 or a positive integer; if `k` is 0, then `rep` is 2 and `tab` is `["1", "2"]`; otherwise, `rep` is the total number of iterations executed by the loop (up to 60) and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t-1`, `n` is 0, `k` is either 0 or not 0, `rep` is 3, `tab` is ['3', '2', '1'] if `k` is not 0, otherwise `tab` is ['3', '2', '1', 'new_element'], `number` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is t, `n` is 0 or less than `k`, `k` is either 0 or less than 0, `rep` is the number of iterations (less than 60), `tab` is a list of string representations of the numbers calculated, and `number` is the last number calculated. If `k` is 0, then `k` remains 0. If `k` is less than 0, then `k` remains less than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
