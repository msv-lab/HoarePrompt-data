The code `n -= Min * Max` will subtract the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`. Given that `Min` is 1 and `Max` is `n`, the expression simplifies to `n -= n`, which means `n` is set to 0.

The other variables (`t`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `k`, and `number`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 0, `rep` is 2, `tab` is either `['1', '1', '1']` or `['3', '2', '1']` or `['1', '1', 'n']` or `['3', '2', 'n']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is `n`, `k` is 0 or `1 - n` depending on initial conditions, `number` is `n` or 1 depending on initial conditions.**
