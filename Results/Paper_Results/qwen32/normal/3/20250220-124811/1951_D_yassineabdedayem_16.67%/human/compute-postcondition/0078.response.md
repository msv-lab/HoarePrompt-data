Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 0, `rep` is 2, `tab` is either `['1', '1']` or `['3', '2']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 2. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is 1 and `number` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
