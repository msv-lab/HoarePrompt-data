The code snippet provided initializes a variable `number` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `rep`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `rep` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer; `rep` is 0; `number` is 0.**
