Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It attempts to determine if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins by setting up to 60 stalls with appropriate prices, but the logic for determining the prices and ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels is flawed.

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Prices and Number of Jewels Bought**:
   - The program calculates `Min` and `Max` values in a way that doesn't guarantee the correct number of jewels bought at each stall.
   - The logic for decrementing `k` and `n` is not consistent with the problem's requirements.

2. **Termination Conditions**:
   - The loop terminates if `n` becomes 0, `k` becomes 0, `rep` reaches 60, or `n` is less than `k`. However, these conditions can lead to incorrect results or premature termination.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of stalls and their prices only if `k` becomes 0, which means Alice bought exactly `k` jewels. However, due to the flawed logic, this condition might not be met even if a valid setup is possible.

To correctly solve the problem, a more systematic approach should be taken, such as using binary search to find the appropriate prices for the stalls or leveraging the fact that Alice buys greedily and can be guided to buy exactly `k` jewels by carefully choosing the prices.
