Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer such that `n >= k`; `k` is a positive integer such that `k - Min` <= n; `rep` is 1; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Max`.**

Natural language: The value of `number` has been updated to be equal to `Max`. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
