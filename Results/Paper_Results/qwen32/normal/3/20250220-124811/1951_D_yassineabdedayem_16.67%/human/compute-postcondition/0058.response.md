The code calculates the minimum and maximum between `n // k` and `k`, and assigns these values to `Min` and `Max` respectively. Given the initial values `n` is 5 and `k` is 3, we can compute the values of `Min` and `Max` as follows:

- `n // k` is `5 // 3` which equals `1`.
- `int(n / k)` is `int(5 / 3)` which equals `1`.
- Therefore, `Min` is `min(1, 3)` which equals `1`.
- And `Max` is `max(1, 3)` which equals `3`.

The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, and `number` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 5, `k` is 3, `rep` is 0, `tab` is `[]`, `number` is 0, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 3**.
