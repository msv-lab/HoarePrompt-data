Let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is defined as `t-1` (This seems to be a typo or an incomplete statement, so we will assume it's not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
- `n` is `0`.
- `k` is `0`.
- `rep` is `3`.
- `tab` is `['3', '2', '1']`.
- `number` is `1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement is attempting to print the value of the variable `i`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the variable `i`. Since `i` is not defined in the given initial state, it would result in a `NameError` if the code were executed.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided, the variable `i` is not defined, so the code will not execute successfully and will raise an error. However, based on the task requirements, we should describe the expected output if `i` were defined.

Since `i` is not defined, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the code as given will not produce any valid output without additional context or definition of `i`.

However, if we hypothetically assume that `i` were defined in some previous part of the code (not provided here), we would print the value of `i` followed by a space.

### Output (Hypothetical):
If `i` were defined, say `i` is `5`, the output would be:
Output: **5 **

But since `i` is not defined in the given initial state:
Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**

Given the task constraints, we should provide the output based on the information provided, which indicates that `i` is not defined.

### Final Output:
Output: **NameError: name 'i' is not defined**
