The code snippet `rep += 1` increments the value of `rep` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `t` is `t-1`, `n` is 2, `k` is either 0 or 2, `rep` is 0, `tab` is either `['1']` or `['3']`, `number` is either 1 or 3, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 3, and there are conditions on `k` and `number` based on the values of `Max` and `n * Min`. Since `rep` is the only variable being modified, we update its value accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 2, `k` is either 0 or 2, `rep` is 1, `tab` is either `['1']` or `['3']`, `number` is either 1 or 3, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 3. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is 2 and `number` is 3.**
