The value of `k` is updated to `k - Min`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer; `k` is a positive integer such that `k - Min` <= n; `rep` is 0; `number` is `Max`; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` is min(n // k, k); `Max` is max(int(n / k), k); `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.
