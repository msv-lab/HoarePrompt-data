Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer such that `n >= k` and `n - Min * Max` > 0 and `n - Min * Max` >= `k`; `k` is a positive integer such that `k - Min` <= n and `k` has been updated based on the initial conditions; `rep` is 2; `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and now also contains the string representation of `number` appended to it; `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`; `number` is `Max`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `number` is now set to `Max`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
