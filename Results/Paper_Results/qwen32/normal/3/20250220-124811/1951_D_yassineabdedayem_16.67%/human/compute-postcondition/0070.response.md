Let's break down the code snippet and update the variables accordingly:

Given:
- `n` is 2
- `k` is 2

The code snippet:
```python
Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
```

Calculate the new values for `Min` and `Max`:

1. `n // k` is `2 // 2` which equals `1`.
2. `int(n / k)` is `int(2 / 2)` which equals `1`.

Thus:
- `Min` is `min(1, 2)` which equals `1`.
- `Max` is `max(1, 2)` which equals `2`.

The values of `t`, `rep`, `tab`, `number` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 2, `k` is 2, `rep` is 1, `tab` is either `['1']` or `['3']`, `number` is 3, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 2**.
