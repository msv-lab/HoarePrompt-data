To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop statement. The loop will continue executing as long as all of the following conditions are true:

1. `n != 0`
2. `k > 0`
3. `rep < 60`
4. `n >= k`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `t-1`
- `n` is 2
- `k` is either 0 or 2
- `rep` is 1
- `tab` is either `['1']` or `['3']`
- `number` is either 1 or 3
- `Min` is 1
- `Max` is 3

We need to ensure that the conditions in the `while` loop are satisfied for the next iteration.

1. **`n != 0`**: Since `n` is 2, this condition is already satisfied.
2. **`k > 0`**: `k` is either 0 or 2. To satisfy this condition, `k` must be 2.
3. **`rep < 60`**: Since `rep` is 1, this condition is already satisfied.
4. **`n >= k`**: Since `n` is 2, `k` must be 2 or less to satisfy this condition. Given that `k` is either 0 or 2, and we already determined that `k` must be 2, this condition is satisfied.

From the problem statement, we also have the additional conditions:
- If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is 1.
- Otherwise, `k` is 2 and `number` is 3.

Given that `Max` is 3 and `k` is 2, the first condition (`Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`) is not met. Therefore, the second condition applies, which means `k` is 2 and `number` is 3. This aligns with our previous determination that `k` must be 2.

No other states need to be adjusted since the conditions in the `while` loop are only dependent on `n`, `k`, and `rep`.

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is 2, `k` is 2, `rep` is 1, `tab` is either `['1']` or `['3']`, `number` is 3, `Min` is 1, `Max` is 3**
