The `print('NO')` statement in the provided code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, and `tab` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables. The print statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, and `tab`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **NO**
