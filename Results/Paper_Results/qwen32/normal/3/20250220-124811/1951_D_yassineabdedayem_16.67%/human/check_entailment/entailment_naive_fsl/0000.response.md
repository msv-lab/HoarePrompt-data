Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and potential scenarios described in the problem statement. Letâ€™s analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum and Maximum Prices**:
   - The program calculates `Min` and `Max` incorrectly and uses them in a way that does not guarantee the correct number of jewels will be bought by Alice. The logic to determine `Min` and `Max` and their usage to update `k` and `n` is flawed.
   - Specifically, `Min` and `Max` are calculated as:
     ```python
     (Min, Max) = (min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k))
     ```
     This calculation does not ensure that the prices set will lead to Alice buying exactly `k` jewels. The program then uses these values to update `k` and `n`, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Logic to Determine Prices**:
   - The logic to determine the prices `number` and to update `k` and `n` is flawed. The program tries to balance between `Min` and `Max` but does not ensure that the total number of jewels bought by Alice will be exactly `k`.
   - For example, the program might set prices that do not allow Alice to buy the exact number of jewels required (`k`). This could be due to incorrect calculations of how many jewels Alice can buy at each stall.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` is very large and `k` is small, or vice versa. The logic might fail to produce a valid set of prices that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - For example, consider the case where `n` is a very large number and `k` is 1. The program might set prices that do not allow Alice to buy exactly 1 jewel.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the prices in a single line separated by spaces, but the problem statement does not specify the format of the output prices. However, the logic to determine the prices is flawed, so the output format is irrelevant if the prices are incorrect.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider a specific test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
1000000000000000000 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
1
1000000000000000000
```

**Actual Output:**
The program might not produce the correct output because of the flawed logic to determine the prices.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all potential cases, and hence, the correctness is **False**.
