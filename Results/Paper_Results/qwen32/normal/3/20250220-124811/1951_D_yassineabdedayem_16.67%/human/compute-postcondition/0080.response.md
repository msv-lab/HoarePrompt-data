The code snippet updates the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the calculations involving `n`, `k`, and integer division. Given that `n` is at least 1 and `k` is 1, the calculations simplify as follows:

- `Min` is reassigned to the minimum value between `n // k` and `k`. Since `k` is 1, this simplifies to `min(n, 1)`. Given that `n` is at least 1, `Min` will be 1.
- `Max` is reassigned to the maximum value between `int(n / k)` and `k`. Again, since `k` is 1, this simplifies to `max(n, 1)`. Given that `n` is at least 1, `Max` will be `n`.

The other variables (`t`, `rep`, `tab`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `rep` is 2, `tab` is either `['1', '1']` or `['3', '2']`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is `n`, `k` is 1**.
