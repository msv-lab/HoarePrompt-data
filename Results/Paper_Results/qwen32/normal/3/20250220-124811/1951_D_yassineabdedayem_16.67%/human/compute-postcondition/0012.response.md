The code snippet assigns the value of `Max` to the variable `number`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the value of `number` now equals `Max`, which is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is a non-zero integer; `k` is a positive integer such that k <= n; `rep` is 0; `number` is `Max`; `tab` is an empty list; `Min` is min(n // k, k); `Max` is max(int(n / k), k); `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**.
