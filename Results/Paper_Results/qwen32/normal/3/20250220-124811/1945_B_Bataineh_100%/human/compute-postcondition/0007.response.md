To determine what will be printed by the `print(2 + m // b)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input.
   - `i` is not initialized.
   - Either `m` is not less than `a` or `m` is not less than `b`.
   - The current value of `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition `m < a` and `m > b` tells us that `m` lies strictly between `b` and `a` (i.e., `b < m < a`).

3. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression `2 + m // b` involves integer division `m // b` which divides `m` by `b` and rounds down to the nearest integer.
   - The result of this integer division is then added to 2.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `b < m < a`, the exact value of `m // b` depends on the specific values of `m` and `b`.
   - However, we can describe the output in terms of `m` and `b` as `2 + (m // b)`.

Given the above analysis, the final output will be described in terms of the values of `m` and `b` as follows:

Output: **2 + (m // b) (where m is an integer such that b < m < a and b is an integer)**
