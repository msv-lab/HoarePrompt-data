Let's analyze the given task step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input.
- `i` is `i + 1` (though `i` is not defined in the initial state, this operation is mentioned but not relevant to the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(2)` statement directly prints the integer `2`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and even the operation on `i` do not affect the output of this print statement.

### Output:
The print statement will output the integer `2`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **2**
