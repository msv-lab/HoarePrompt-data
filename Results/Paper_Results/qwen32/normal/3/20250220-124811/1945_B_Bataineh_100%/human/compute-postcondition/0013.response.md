Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers, `i` is not initialized, and either `m` is not less than `a` or `m` is not less than `b`. Additionally, it is not the case that `m` is less than `a` and `m` is greater than `b`. If `m` is less than `b` and `m` is greater than `a`, then `m` satisfies `a < m < b`. Otherwise, it is not true that `m` is less than `b` and `m` is greater than `a`.**
