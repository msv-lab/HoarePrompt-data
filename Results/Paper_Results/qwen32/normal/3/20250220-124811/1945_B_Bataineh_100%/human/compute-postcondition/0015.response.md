Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, and `m` is an integer read from input. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `i` is not initialized. Otherwise, `m` is not less than both `a` and `b`, which means `m` is either greater than or equal to `a`, greater than or equal to `b`, or between `a` and `b` (exclusive). If `m` is between `b` and `a` (exclusive), then `m < a` and `m > b`. If `m` is between `a` and `b` (exclusive), then `a < m < b`. `i` is not initialized in either case.**
