The code snippet provided is `t = int(input())`. This line reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is already an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. After executing this line, the value of `t` will be updated to the integer read from the input, which is still guaranteed to be within the same range.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**
