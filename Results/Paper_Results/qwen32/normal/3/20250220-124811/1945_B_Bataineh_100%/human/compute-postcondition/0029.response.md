To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input.
- `i` is `i + 1` (Note: The variable `i` is mentioned in the initial state, but it is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 + m // a)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement calculates the expression `2 + m // a` and prints the result.
- `m // a` is an integer division of `m` by `a`. This means it will return the largest integer less than or equal to `m / a`.
- The result of `m // a` is then added to 2.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `m` and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of `2 + m // a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 + m // a (where m // a is the integer division of m by a)**
