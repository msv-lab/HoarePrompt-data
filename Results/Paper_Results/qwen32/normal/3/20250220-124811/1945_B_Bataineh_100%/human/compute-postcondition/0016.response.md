The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable used in the `range(t)` function. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from input.
- `m` is an integer read from input.
- `i` is not initialized if `m` is less than both `a` and `b`; otherwise, `i` would have been incremented by 1 in the previous iteration.

Since the loop is `for i in range(t):`, `i` should be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`. However, since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can simply state that `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, `m` is an integer read from input, `i` is incremented by 1**.
