Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` has the key `(first_element % x, first_element % y)` with its value incremented by 1; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(first_element % x, first_element % y)`; `num` is `arr[1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `r_y` has been updated to `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
