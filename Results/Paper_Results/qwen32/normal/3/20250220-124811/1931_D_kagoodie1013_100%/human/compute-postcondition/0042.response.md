The code snippet `count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` increments the variable `count` by the value associated with the key `(r_x, r_y)` in the dictionary `residue_map`, or by 0 if the key does not exist. The values of `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated as `-arr[2] % x` and `arr[2] % y`, respectively. The variable `current_key` is defined as `(arr[2] % x, arr[2] % y)`, which is the same as `(r_x, r_y)`, and `residue_map` has `current_key` mapped to `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`. The variable `num` is `arr[2]`.

Since `count` is initially set to `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, and the code increments `count` by the same value, `count` effectively doubles its initial value if `(r_x, r_y)` exists in `residue_map`. If `(r_x, r_y)` does not exist, `count` remains the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with `arr` having at least three elements; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is `2 * residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`; `r_x` is `-arr[2] % x`; `r_y` is `arr[2] % y`; `current_key` is `(arr[2] % x, arr[2] % y)`; `num` is `arr[2]`.**
