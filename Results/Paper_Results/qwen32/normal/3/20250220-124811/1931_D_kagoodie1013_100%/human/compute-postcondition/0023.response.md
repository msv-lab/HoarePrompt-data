The code snippet provided appends the value of `count` to the `results` list. No other variables are modified in this snippet. Therefore, the `results` list will now include the current value of `count` as its last element. The state of `test_cases`, `count`, and `residue_map` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is incremented by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each element in `arr`; `residue_map` has keys for each unique pair `(num % x, num % y)` with their values representing the number of occurrences of each pair in `arr`.**
