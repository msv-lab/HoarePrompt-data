The code assigns the value `(num % x, num % y)` to the variable `current_key`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, `count`, and `residue_map` remain unchanged. The values `r_x` and `r_y` are also unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `r_x` is `-n % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**
