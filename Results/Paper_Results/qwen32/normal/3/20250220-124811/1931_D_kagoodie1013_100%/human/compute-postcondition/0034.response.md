The code snippet provided updates the value of `r_x` to be the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `num` is `arr[1]`. Hence, `r_x` is recalculated as `-arr[1] % x`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with `arr` having at least one element; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`; `r_x` is the remainder of `-arr[1]` divided by `x`; `r_y` is the remainder of `arr[1]` divided by `y`; `current_key` is `(arr[1] % x, arr[1] % y)`; `num` is `arr[1]`.**
