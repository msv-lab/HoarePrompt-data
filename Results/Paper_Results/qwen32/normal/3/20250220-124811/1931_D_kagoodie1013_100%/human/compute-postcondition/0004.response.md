The only variable in the loop head is `num`, and it depends on the list `arr` which is part of the tuples in `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element.

Given the state before the for loop starts, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, and each tuple contains `arr` as one of its elements. To ensure that the loop executes, `arr` must have at least one integer.

Since the loop is nested within the context of `test_cases`, we need to ensure that `test_cases` has at least one tuple, and that tuple must contain an `arr` with at least one element. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `results`, `count`, `residue_map`) are not directly relevant to the execution of the inner loop over `arr`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `test_cases` contains at least one tuple where `arr` has at least one element.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` (an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` (an integer such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers, each integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); `test_cases` must have at least one tuple where `arr` has at least one element; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary**
