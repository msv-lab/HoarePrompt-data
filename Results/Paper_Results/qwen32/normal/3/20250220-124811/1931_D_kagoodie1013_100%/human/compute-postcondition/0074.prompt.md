You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of integers a of length n, such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each a_i in a. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        residue_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            r_x = -num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = num % x, num % y
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is an empty list; `results` is a list containing the final accumulated `count` values for each test case.
    return results
    #The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the final accumulated `count` values for each test case. Since `test_cases` is an empty list, it implies that no test cases were processed, and thus `results` is also an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. The function processes each test case to compute a `count` value and returns a list `results` containing these `count` values for each test case. If `test_cases` is an empty list, the function returns an empty list `results`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the final accumulated `count` values for each test case. Since `test_cases` is an empty list, it implies that no test cases were processed, and thus `results` is also an empty list.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
