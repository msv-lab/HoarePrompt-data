Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The program reads multiple test cases, each with an array `a` and integers `x` and `y`. It aims to count the number of "beautiful" pairs `(i, j)` where `1 <= i < j <= n` and both `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

The core logic of the program is implemented in the `func_1` function. Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes a count to 0 and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of pairs of residues `(a_i % x, a_i % y)`.

2. **Iterating through the array**: For each number `num` in the array `arr`, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`:
   - `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`. This is equivalent to finding the residue that `num` should have to make the sum with some previous number divisible by `x`.
   - `r_y` is calculated as `num % y`. This is the residue that `num` has modulo `y`.

3. **Counting beautiful pairs**: It then looks up in `residue_map` how many numbers previously encountered have the residue pair `(r_x, r_y)`. This count is added to the total count of beautiful pairs.

4. **Updating the residue map**: The residue pair `(num % x, num % y)` for the current number `num` is then added to the `residue_map`.

5. **Storing results**: After processing all numbers in the array, the count of beautiful pairs for that test case is stored in the `results` list.

The logic for calculating `r_x` as `-num % x` is crucial. This is because for `a_i + a_j` to be divisible by `x`, the residues of `a_i` and `a_j` modulo `x` must add up to a multiple of `x`. If `a_j` has residue `num % x`, then `a_i` must have a residue that complements `num % x` to make their sum a multiple of `x`. This complement is `-num % x`.

The logic for `r_y` as `num % y` is straightforward because for `a_i - a_j` to be divisible by `y`, the residues of `a_i` and `a_j` modulo `y` must be equal.

The program efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs in O(n) time per test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.
