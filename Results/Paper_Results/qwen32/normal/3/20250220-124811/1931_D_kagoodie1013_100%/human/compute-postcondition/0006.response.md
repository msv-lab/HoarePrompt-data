The code snippet assigns the value of `num % y` to the variable `r_y`. However, the variable `num` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming `num` is a typo and should be `x` (as it is the only integer variable provided in the initial state that makes sense in this context), the code would compute `x % y` and assign it to `r_y`.

Given this assumption, `r_y` will be the remainder of `x` divided by `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` (an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` (an integer such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers, each integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); `test_cases` must have at least one tuple where `arr` has at least one element; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `r_x` is `-arr[0] % x`; `r_y` is `x % y`.**
