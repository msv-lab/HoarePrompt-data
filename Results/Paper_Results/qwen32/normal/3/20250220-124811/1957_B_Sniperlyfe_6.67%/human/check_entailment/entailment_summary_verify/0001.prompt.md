You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Function Summary: 
The function generates a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is initialized to the maximum value that can be represented with the number of bits in `k`. It then increases the last element of `nums` by the remaining value of `k` after distributing the initial values. The function returns this modified list `nums`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
1. The sum of these integers is `k`.
2. The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers is maximized.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that is supposed to generate the sequence for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
2. **Loop through indices**: For each index `i` in the range `n`, it sets `nums[i]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but all bits set to 1. It then subtracts this value from `k`.
3. **Adjust the last element**: After the loop, it adds the remaining `k` to the last element of `nums`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Bitwise OR Maximization**: The program does not ensure that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized. Instead, it seems to be trying to distribute the largest possible numbers across the sequence, which does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
   
2. **Handling of Remaining Sum**: The program simply adds the remaining sum to the last element, which could lead to suboptimal results in terms of maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR, we should aim to set as many bits as possible to 1 across the sequence. One effective strategy is to use the smallest numbers that have 1s in their binary representation, such as powers of 2, and distribute them optimally.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
