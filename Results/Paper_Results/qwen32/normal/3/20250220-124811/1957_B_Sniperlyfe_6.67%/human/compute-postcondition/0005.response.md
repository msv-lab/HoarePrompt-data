The given code snippet sets the value of `nums[i]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. Since `i` is already defined as `i + 1` in the initial state, we need to consider the value of `nums[i]` after this operation.

Given that `nums[i]` was previously 0 (as per the initial state description), it will now be set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9 minus `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `nums` is a list where `nums[i]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `i + 1`**.
