The code snippet assigns a specific value to `nums[i]`. Given that `nums` is initially a list of `n` zeros, the value of `nums[i]` changes to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The expression `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` calculates a value based on the bit length of `k`.

To understand this more clearly:
- `k.bit_length()` gives the number of bits necessary to represent `k` in binary.
- `1 << k.bit_length() - 1` shifts the number 1 to the left by `k.bit_length() - 1` positions, creating a binary number with a 1 followed by `k.bit_length() - 1` zeros.
- Subtracting 1 from this value results in a binary number with `k.bit_length() - 1` ones.

Therefore, the value assigned to `nums[i]` is a number with `k.bit_length() - 1` ones in binary representation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and `nums` is a list where `nums[i]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements are 0.**
