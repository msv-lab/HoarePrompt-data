Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program's approach to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence elements is flawed.

The idea of using `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` to generate numbers with a large number of 1s in their binary representation is incorrect and does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the overall bitwise OR. Instead, the program should aim to distribute the sum `k` among the `n` numbers in such a way that the bitwise OR of the numbers has the maximum possible number of 1s.

A better approach would be to start with the highest possible powers of 2 and distribute the sum `k` among the numbers, ensuring that the bitwise OR is maximized. This can be achieved by using a greedy algorithm that assigns the largest possible powers of 2 to the numbers until the sum `k` is exhausted.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    i = 0
    while k > 0:
        if i >= n:
            break
        power = 1
        while (power << 1) <= k:
            power <<= 1
        nums[i] = power
        k -= power
        i += 1
    return nums
```

This approach ensures that the sum `k` is distributed among the `n` numbers in such a way that the bitwise OR of the numbers has the maximum possible number of 1s.
