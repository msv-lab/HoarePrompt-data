The code snippet `k -= nums[i]` modifies the value of `k` by subtracting the value of `nums[i]` from it. Given the initial state, `nums[i]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements in `nums` are 0. Therefore, the value of `k` will be reduced by `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9 minus `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` minus `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `nums` is a list where `nums[i]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
