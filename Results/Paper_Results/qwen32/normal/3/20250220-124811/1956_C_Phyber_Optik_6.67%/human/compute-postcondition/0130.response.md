Output State: **t is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, n is a non-negative integer, r is the largest i for which n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n holds true and ensures n + r + 1 is at least 1, sum is the cumulative sum as defined, and j is n + r + 1. The loop has completed all iterations, with j having taken on all values from 1 to n + r + 1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes all its iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `r`, and `sum` remain unchanged from their definitions in the initial state. The variable `j` has cycled through all values from 1 to `n + r + 1`, completing the loop's specified range.
