To determine what will be printed by the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement, let's break down the information given in the initial state and analyze the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t`**: An integer read from the input, and it is greater than or equal to 1. However, the value of `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

2. **`n`**: An integer, and it is greater than or equal to 1. This value is crucial because it determines the range of numbers that will be printed.

3. **`r`**: This is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. While `r` is defined, it is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

4. **`sum`**: This variable is mentioned but not defined or used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

5. **`j`**: This variable is mentioned as `j + 1` and is less than `n + r + 1`. However, `j` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Code Analysis:

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n + 1`. This means it generates numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)` so that each number in the sequence is printed as a separate argument to `print`.

### Output:

Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

For example, if `n` is 5, the output will be:
```
1 2 3 4 5
```

Given the initial state, the output will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the final output is described as:

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
