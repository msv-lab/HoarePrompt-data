To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the relationships between the variables.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0.
- `n`: A non-negative integer input.
- `r`: The last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true and is non-negative. This implies that `r` is the largest integer such that the inequality holds.
- `sum`: The total accumulated sum based on some condition, but its value is not explicitly described in the initial state. It's not directly used in the `print` statement.
- `j`: Calculated as `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 2`. This value is used in the `print` statement.
- The loop terminates if `j` is greater than `n + r`.

### Analysis:
1. **Calculate `j`**:
   - `j` is defined as `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 2`.
   - `(n + 1) // 2` is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2, which essentially gives the floor of `(n + 1) / 2`.
   - Therefore, `j = n + (n + 1) // 2 + 2`.

2. **Determine `r`**:
   - `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - This inequality simplifies to `(n + 1) // 2 > i`.
   - Therefore, `r = (n + 1) // 2 - 1`.

### Print Statement:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

### Output Calculation:
- The first value to be printed is `1`, which is a constant.
- The second value to be printed is `j`, calculated as `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 2`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output `1` followed by the calculated value of `j`.

Output: **1, n + (n + 1) // 2 + 2**
