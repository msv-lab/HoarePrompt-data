The code snippet reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer representing the size of an `n × n` matrix filled with zeroes, and `t` is the number of such test cases. The code only updates the value of `t` by reading the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n × n matrix filled with zeroes.**
