Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is at least 1, `r` is `i`, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated to be equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
