The value of `r` is updated to the value of `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `j`, `sum`, and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2` being greater than `i * n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n + r + 1`. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `r` is `i` and `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `r` is 0 and `sum` is the previous value of `sum` plus `i * n`. `i` is `n`; `r` is `i`.**
