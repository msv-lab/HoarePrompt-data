Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2.
- `sum` is the cumulative sum as defined.
- `j` is `n + r + 1`.
- `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

However, the condition `j` is less than or equal to `n` contradicts the definition of `j` as `n + r + 1`, since `r` is a non-negative integer, making `j` at least `n + 1`. Therefore, the condition `j <= n` cannot be true unless `n` is 0 and `r` is -1, which is not possible given the constraints. This suggests that the condition `j <= n` might be a mistake or an impossible scenario. We will proceed with the assumption that `j` is defined as `n + r + 1` and focus on the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

This statement will print all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Understanding `range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - If `n` is 0, the range will be empty, and nothing will be printed.
   - If `n` is 1, the range will be `[1]`, and `1` will be printed.
   - If `n` is 2, the range will be `[1, 2]`, and `1 2` will be printed.
   - If `n` is 3, the range will be `[1, 2, 3]`, and `1 2 3` will be printed.
   - And so on...

### Final Output Description:
The `print` statement will output all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces. If `n` is 0, no numbers will be printed.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a non-negative integer)**

If `n` is 0, the output will be:
Output: **(nothing)**

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, the most precise description is:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a non-negative integer)**
