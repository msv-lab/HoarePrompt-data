To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and how the variables `j` and `n` are defined and used.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer read from the input, which is greater than or equal to 0.
2. **`n`**: A non-negative integer input.
3. **`r`**: The last `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true and is non-negative.
4. **`sum`**: The total accumulated sum based on the condition (though not directly used in the print statement).
5. **`j`**: Incremented by 1 from its previous value, ensuring `1 <= j <= n + r`.

### Analysis:
- The expression `2, j % n, end=' '` in the `print` statement indicates that three values will be printed: the constant `2`, the result of `j % n`, and there will be no newline after the print statement (due to `end=' '`).
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and it is constrained by `1 <= j <= n + r`.
- `j % n` computes the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.

### Output Description:
- The first value printed is the constant `2`.
- The second value printed is `j % n`, which is the remainder of `j` divided by `n`. Since `j` is incremented and constrained by `1 <= j <= n + r`, the value of `j % n` will cycle through values from `0` to `n-1` as `j` increases.

Given the constraints and the nature of the modulo operation, `j % n` will be a value between `0` and `n-1` inclusive. However, without the exact value of `j`, we can't determine a specific numerical value for `j % n`, but we know it will be within this range.

### Final Output:
Output: **2, j % n (where j % n is the remainder of j divided by n)**
