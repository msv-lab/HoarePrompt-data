### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to fill an `n x n` matrix with values from 1 to `n` using permutations of these values in rows and columns to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix.
   - The maximum sum is achieved when each element in the matrix is the maximum possible value, which is `n`. Thus, the maximum sum is `n * n * n = n^3`.
   - We are allowed to perform no more than `2n` operations.

2. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - To achieve this, we can fill the entire matrix with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` for each row using Type 1 operations. This will ensure that each row has all unique numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - Since we have `n` rows and we can perform up to `2n` operations, this can be done in exactly `n` operations, which is well within the limit.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The given program calculates the sum and the number of operations in a way that does not align with the goal of maximizing the matrix sum.
   - The logic in the program is flawed, as it does not correctly calculate the sum and the operations required to fill the matrix optimally.
   - The program uses a conditional logic involving `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `i * n`, which does not reflect the correct approach to maximize the sum.
   - The operations printed by the program do not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The provided code does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix.
   - The sum calculation and the number of operations are incorrect.
   - The operations themselves do not ensure that each element is filled with the maximum possible value.

### Annotated Code Analysis:

- **Initialization:**
  ```python
  t = int(input())
  for _ in range(t):
      n = int(input())
      sum, r = 0, 0
  ```
  - `t` is the number of test cases.
  - `n` is the size of the matrix for the current test case.
  - `sum` and `r` are initialized to 0.

- **Sum Calculation:**
  ```python
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
      if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
          r = i
          sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
      else:
          sum += i * n
  ```
  - This loop is intended to calculate the sum, but the logic is incorrect.
  - The sum should be `n^3`, and the logic here does not achieve that.

- **Printing Operations:**
  ```python
  print(sum, n + r)
  for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
      if j <= n:
          print(1, j, end=' ')
          print(*range(1, n + 1))
      else:
          print(2, j % n, end=' ')
          print(*range(1, n + 1))
  ```
  - The number of operations printed is `n + r`, which is not necessarily correct.
  - The operations printed do not ensure that the matrix is filled optimally.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect as it does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values using the allowed operations.

### Final: **False**
