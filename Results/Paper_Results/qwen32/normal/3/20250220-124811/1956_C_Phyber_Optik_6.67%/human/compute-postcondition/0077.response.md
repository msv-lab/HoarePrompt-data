To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and Initial State:**
   - `t`: An integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `n`: A non-negative integer input.
   - `r`: The last integer `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true. Since `n * (n + 1) // 2` is a fixed value, `r` is determined based on this condition.
   - `sum`: The total accumulated sum based on the condition (though `sum` is not used in the print statement, it is part of the state).
   - `j`: Calculated as `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 2`.

2. **Condition and Loop:**
   - The loop terminates if `j` is greater than `n + r`. Otherwise, the conditions on `t`, `n`, `r`, `sum`, and `j` remain as specified.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(2, j % n, end=' ')`.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

- **Calculate `r`:**
  - `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
  - For `i = 0`: `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 0 * n` is always true.
  - For `i = 1`: `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 1 * n` simplifies to `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n`.
  - This condition is true if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n`.
  - Generally, `r` is the largest `i` satisfying this inequality. However, without a specific value for `n`, we can't determine the exact value of `r`. But we know that `r` is a non-negative integer.

- **Calculate `j`:**
  - `j` is calculated as `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 2`.
  - `(n + 1) // 2` is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2.
  - Therefore, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 2`.

- **Calculate `j % n`:**
  - `j % n` is the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.
  - Since `j = n + (n + 1) // 2 + 2`, `j % n` simplifies to `((n + 1) // 2 + 2) % n` because `n % n` is 0.

**Output:**
- The `print` statement outputs `2` and `j % n` separated by a space.
- `j % n` is `((n + 1) // 2 + 2) % n`.

Given the above analysis, the output of the print statement can be described as:
Output: **2, ((n + 1) // 2 + 2) % n**
