The code snippet `sum += i * n` updates the value of `sum` by adding `i * n` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `sum` is initially 0. After executing the code, `sum` will be equal to `i * n`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is at least 1, `r` is 0, `sum` is `i * n`, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.**
