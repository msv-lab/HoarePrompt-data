Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1; `r` is `(n + 1) // 2`; `sum` is the computed sum as described above; `j` is `j + 1` and is less than `n + r + 1`. Regardless of whether `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the variables `t`, `n`, `r`, `sum`, and `j` maintain their described properties and `j` is incremented by 1.**
