Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `sum` is a computed sum (though its exact computation isn't detailed here).
- `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Explanation:
The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to and including `n`. The `*` operator unpacks the range object so that each element is printed as a separate argument to the `print` function, separated by spaces.

### Output:
The output will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, inclusive, separated by spaces. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n)**

This means that the numbers from 1 to `n` will be printed, each separated by a space.
