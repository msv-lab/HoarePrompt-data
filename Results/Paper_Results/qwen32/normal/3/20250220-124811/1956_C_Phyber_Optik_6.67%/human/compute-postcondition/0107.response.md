Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n + r + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `r` is updated to `n + 1` and `sum` is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its previous value. Otherwise, `sum` is updated to `sum + (i * n)`**.
