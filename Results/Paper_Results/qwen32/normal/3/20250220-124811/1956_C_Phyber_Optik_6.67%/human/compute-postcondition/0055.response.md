The code snippet `r = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `j`, `sum`, and the condition that determines the initial values of `r` and `sum` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`, `r` is `i`, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `(i + 1) * n` based on the initial condition, `i` is `i + 1`.**
