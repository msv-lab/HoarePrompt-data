### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an n x n matrix filled with zeros.
   - We can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row `i` and rearrange its elements to any permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
     - Type 2: Choose a column `i` and rearrange its elements to any permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix with no more than 2n operations.

2. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - The maximum sum is achieved when each element in the matrix is the maximum possible value, which is `n`.
   - The sum of all elements in the matrix would then be `n * n * n = n^3`.

3. **Operations Strategy:**
   - To achieve this, we need to ensure that each row and each column has all unique numbers from 1 to n.
   - One way to do this is to fill the first `n` rows with permutations of 1 to n (using Type 1 operations).
   - Then, fill the remaining rows (if any) by permuting columns (using Type 2 operations).

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The given program calculates the sum as `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each row initially, which is incorrect. The sum should be `n * n` for each row when filled with numbers 1 to n.
   - The program then prints a sequence of operations. However, the logic for determining the number of operations and the way rows and columns are filled seems flawed.
   - Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the number of operations and does not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The provided code does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix.
   - The sum calculation and the number of operations are incorrect.
   - The operations themselves do not ensure that each element is filled with the maximum possible value.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
