Let's break down the provided initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `sum` is the computed sum (though its computation is not described in the initial state, it's not used in the print statement).
- `j` is `j + 1` and is less than or equal to `n + r` (also, `j` is not used in the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function, which then prints these numbers separated by spaces.

Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n`.

### Example:
If `n` is 5, the `range(1, 6)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and the `print(*range(1, 6))` will output:
```
1 2 3 4 5
```

### General Output:
Given that `n` is any integer greater than or equal to 1, the output will be a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`, separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
