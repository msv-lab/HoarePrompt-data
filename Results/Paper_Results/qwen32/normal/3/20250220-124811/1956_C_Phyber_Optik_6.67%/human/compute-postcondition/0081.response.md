To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **t**: This is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.

2. **n**: This is a non-negative integer input. The value of `n` is not explicitly given, so we will keep it as `n`.

3. **r**: This variable is defined as the last `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true. Let's analyze this condition:
   - `n * (n + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to `(n + 1) // 2 > i` when `n` is not zero.
   - The largest integer `i` satisfying this condition is `r = (n - 1) // 2` (if `n` is positive).

4. **sum**: This variable is mentioned but not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.

5. **j**: This variable is incremented by 1 from its previous value and is constrained by `1 <= j <= n + r`. The exact value of `j` is not explicitly given, but we know it must be within this range.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```
The output will be the integer `1`, followed by the value of `j`, with no newline at the end.

Since `j` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe its value in terms of the constraints provided.

**Output: 1, j (where 1 <= j <= n + r)**

This describes the output precisely based on the given initial state.
