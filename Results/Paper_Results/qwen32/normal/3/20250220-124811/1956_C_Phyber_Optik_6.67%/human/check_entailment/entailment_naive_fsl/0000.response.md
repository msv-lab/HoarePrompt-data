Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix or provide the correct sequence of operations to achieve that sum. The logic for calculating the sum and the operations is flawed.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Sum:**
   - The code calculates the sum by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` for the first `r` rows and then adding `i * n` for the remaining rows. This approach does not maximize the sum of the matrix.
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the matrix with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` in each row and each column, which results in the sum being `n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`.

2. **Incorrect Number of Operations:**
   - The code calculates the number of operations as `n + r`, which is not necessarily the minimum or even a valid number of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The problem statement guarantees that the maximum sum can always be obtained in no more than `2n` operations, and the correct approach is to fill each row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This can be done in exactly `2n` operations.

### Correct Approach:
- For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, perform a Type 1 operation to fill the row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- For each column `j` from 1 to `n`, perform a Type 2 operation to fill the column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- This ensures that each cell `a[i, j]` is set to the maximum possible value, leading to the maximum sum of the matrix.

### Correct Code Example:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, j, *range(1, n + 1))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This code correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a valid sequence of operations to achieve that sum.
