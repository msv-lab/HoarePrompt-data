To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
2. **`n`**: An integer and is greater than or equal to 1.
3. **`r`**: Calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. This value is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task.
4. **`sum`**: A computed sum, but its value is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific task.
5. **`j`**: An integer that is less than or equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs two values separated by a space: the integer `1` and the value of the variable `j`.
- The `end=' '` argument specifies that the print statement should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

### Output:
Since `j` is described as an integer that is less than or equal to `n`, the exact value of `j` is not provided. However, we know it is some integer within the range `[1, n]`.

Therefore, the output will be the integer `1`, followed by the value of `j`, with a space at the end.

Output: **1 [j] (where j is an integer less than or equal to n)**
