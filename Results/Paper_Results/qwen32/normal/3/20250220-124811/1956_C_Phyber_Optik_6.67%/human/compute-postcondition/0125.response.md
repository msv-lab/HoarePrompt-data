Let's analyze the given code step by step based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
2. `n` is a non-negative integer.
3. `r` is the largest integer `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2.
4. `sum` is the cumulative sum as defined (though `sum` is not used in the print statement).
5. `j` is `n + r + 1`.

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is `print(1, j, end=' ')`. This means it will print `1`, followed by the value of `j`, and end with a space instead of a newline.
- We need to determine the value of `j` which is `n + r + 1`.
- To find `r`, we need to determine the largest `i` for which the inequality `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true.

Let's break down the inequality:
- `n * (n + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
- We need to find the largest `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

Rewriting the inequality:
\[ \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} > i \cdot n \]
\[ \frac{n + 1}{2} > i \]
\[ i < \frac{n + 1}{2} \]

Since `i` must be an integer, the largest possible value for `i` is `floor((n + 1) / 2) - 1` if `n > 0`, and `0` if `n == 0`.

However, we also need to ensure that `n + r + 1` is at least 2:
\[ n + r + 1 \geq 2 \]
\[ r \geq 1 - n \]

Given that `r` is the largest `i` satisfying the inequality, and considering the additional constraint, we can determine `r` as follows:
- If `n == 0`, then `r` must be `1` to satisfy `n + r + 1 >= 2`.
- If `n > 0`, then `r` is `floor((n + 1) / 2) - 1` adjusted to ensure `n + r + 1 >= 2`.

Thus, `r` can be calculated as:
\[ r = \max\left(0, \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor - 1\right) \]

Finally, `j` is:
\[ j = n + r + 1 \]

### Conclusion:
- `j` is calculated based on the value of `n` and the derived `r`.
- The print statement will output `1` followed by the value of `j`.

### Output:
Output: **1, n + max(0, floor((n + 1) / 2) - 1) + 1 (where n is a non-negative integer)**

This output precisely describes what will be printed based on the given initial state.
