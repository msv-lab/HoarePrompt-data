Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix using no more than 2n operations. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Sum Calculation Logic**: The program attempts to calculate the sum based on a conditional logic involving the triangular number sequence and the size `n`. However, this logic does not align with the goal of maximizing the sum of the matrix. The maximum sum can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n], which would result in a sum of n * (n * (n + 1) / 2).

2. **Operations Logic**: The program prints a series of operations to manipulate the matrix. For each row and column, it assigns the permutation [1, 2, ..., n]. However, the logic for determining the number of operations (m) and the specific operations themselves is flawed. The program uses `n + r` operations, where `r` is determined based on a condition that does not guarantee the maximum sum. It should simply use `2n` operations to fill each row and each column with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

3. **Output Format**: While the output format is correct in terms of printing the sum and the operations, the values printed do not correspond to the maximum sum or the correct operations.

To correct the program, we need to:
- Calculate the maximum sum as n * (n * (n + 1) / 2).
- Use exactly `2n` operations: `n` operations to fill each row with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n], and `n` operations to fill each column with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        # Maximum sum for the matrix
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        
        # Number of operations
        m = 2 * n
        
        print(max_sum, m)
        
        # Operations to fill each row
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        
        # Operations to fill each column
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, j, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))

#State: t is the number of test cases, n is the size of the matrix for the last test case, max_sum is the maximum sum for the last test case, and m is the number of operations (2n) for the last test case. The loop has completed all iterations, with i and j having taken on all values from 1 to n for the last test case.
```

Correctness: **False**
