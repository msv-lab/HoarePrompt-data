To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
2. `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1.
3. `r` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
4. `sum` is mentioned but not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we won't focus on it for this specific print statement.
5. `j` is described as `j + 1` and is less than or equal to `n + r`. However, `j` is not initialized or given an initial value in the initial state, so we can only infer its behavior based on the description.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will print the integer `1`, followed by the value of `j`.
- The `end=' '` parameter means that after printing `1` and `j`, the output will end with a space instead of the default newline character.

### Determining `j`:
- The value of `j` is described as `j + 1` and is less than or equal to `n + r`. This suggests that `j` is incremented in some loop or iterative process, but we don't have the full context of how `j` is initialized or incremented.
- Since `j` is not explicitly initialized in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can infer that `j` is an integer that will be printed.

### Output Description:
Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:
- The first value printed is `1`.
- The second value printed is `j`, which is an integer that has been incremented and is less than or equal to `n + r`.

Since the exact value of `j` is not provided, we will describe it using the given information.

### Final Output:
Output: **1, j (where j is an integer that has been incremented and is less than or equal to n + r)**
