Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0.
- `n` is a non-negative integer input.
- `r` is the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true and is non-negative.
- `sum` is the total accumulated sum based on the condition.
- `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1` and `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The `*` operator unpacks the range into individual arguments for the `print` function, so it will print each number separated by a space.

### Explanation of Variables:
- `t`: Not used in the code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `n`: This is a non-negative integer input. It determines the upper limit of the range that will be printed.
- `r`: This variable is defined based on a condition involving `n` and `i`, but it is not used in the code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `sum`: This variable is defined as the total accumulated sum based on a condition, but it is not used in the code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `j`: This variable is defined as `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1` and is supposed to be less than or equal to `n`, but this condition seems inconsistent with the definition of `j`. Given the initial state and the code, `j` does not affect the output.

### Output:
Given the code snippet, the output will be the numbers from 1 to `n` printed on the same line, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the non-negative integer input)**

To format it according to the given instructions:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the non-negative integer input)**
