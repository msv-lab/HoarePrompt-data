The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n + r + 1`, and `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Since `i` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`. However, the loop condition is `i in range(1, n + 1)`, which means `i` should be less than `n + 1` for the loop to continue. Therefore, the loop will not execute again if `i` is set to `n + 1`.

To adjust the state correctly for the start of the next iteration, we need to set `i` to the next value it should take, which is `n + 1`, but recognize that the loop will terminate because `i` will no longer be in the range `(1, n + 1)`.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n + r + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`**
