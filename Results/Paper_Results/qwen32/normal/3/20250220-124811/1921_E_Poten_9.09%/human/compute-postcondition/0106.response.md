The code appends the string 'Draw' to the `answers` list. Therefore, the `answers` list will now contain an additional element 'Draw'. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and now includes an additional 'Draw', `i` is `i + 1`.**
