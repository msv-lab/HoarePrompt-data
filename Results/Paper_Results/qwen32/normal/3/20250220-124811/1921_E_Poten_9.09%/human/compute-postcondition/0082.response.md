The code snippet updates the `clues` list by reading a line of input, splitting it into components, converting each component to an integer, and then mapping these integers into a list. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `answers`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is `i + 1`.**
