Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and it is not the case that `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`. Additionally, either both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd. The current value of `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1. It is not the case that `clues[1] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` and `clues[3] - clues[5] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. The variable `test_cases` still equals `t`. The `answers` list now contains the string 'Bob'. The `clues` list retains its initial values, and all the conditions about the elements of `clues` remain unchanged.
