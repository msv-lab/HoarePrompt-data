To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(j)`, we need to analyze the given initial state and see if there is any information about a variable `j`. 

The initial state provides information about:
- `t`: a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases`: equal to `t`.
- `clues`: a list of integers.
- `i`: initialized to 0.
- `answers`: a list containing at least one element, each either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.

However, there is no mention of a variable `j` in the initial state. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot determine the value of `j` or what will be printed by `print(j)`.

Given the lack of information about `j`, the most precise description we can provide is that the output will depend on the value of `j`, which is not specified in the initial state.

Output: **j (where j is an undefined variable in the given initial state)**
