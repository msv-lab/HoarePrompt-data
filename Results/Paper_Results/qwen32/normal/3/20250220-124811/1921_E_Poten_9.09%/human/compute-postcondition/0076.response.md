Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2]` <= `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, one of `clues[2]` or `clues[4]` is even and the other is odd, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, the `answers` list is determined based on the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]`. If this difference is greater than 1, `answers` contains the string `'Draw'` if either `clues[5] - 1` or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string `'Alice'`. If the difference is 1, `answers` contains the string `'Draw'` if either `clues[5] - 2` or `clues[3] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Otherwise, `answers` is `['Alice']`. If `clues[3]` is not greater than `clues[5]`, the `answers` list remains empty.**
