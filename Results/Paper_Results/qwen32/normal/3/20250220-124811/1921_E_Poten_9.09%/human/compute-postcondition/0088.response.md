The provided Python code snippet appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and now includes an additional 'Draw', `i` is `i + 1`.**
