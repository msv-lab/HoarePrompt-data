Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and now includes 'Draw' if `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise it includes 'Alice', and `i` is `i + 1`.**
