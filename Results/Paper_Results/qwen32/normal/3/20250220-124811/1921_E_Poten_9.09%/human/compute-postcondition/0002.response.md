To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is greater than 0, and `i` will start from 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is an input integer equal to `t`
- `answers` is an empty list

The loop will execute as long as `test_cases` is at least 1. Since `test_cases` is equal to `t`, and `t` is a positive integer, the loop will execute. The value of `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function in the loop head.

Thus, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes, as the condition is already satisfied by the given state.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `answers` is an empty list**
