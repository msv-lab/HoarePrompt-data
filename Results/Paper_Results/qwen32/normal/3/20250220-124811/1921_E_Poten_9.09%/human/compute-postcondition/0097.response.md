Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. If `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. `i` is `i + 1`.**
