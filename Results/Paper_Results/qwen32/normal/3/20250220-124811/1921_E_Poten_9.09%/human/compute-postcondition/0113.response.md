The code appends the string 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `answers` now includes an additional element, 'Draw'.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and now includes 'Draw', `i` is `i + 1`.**
