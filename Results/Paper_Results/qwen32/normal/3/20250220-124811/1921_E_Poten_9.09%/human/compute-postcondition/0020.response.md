Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and it is not the case that `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`. Additionally, either both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd. `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]` and the current value of `clues[3]` is less than the current value of `clues[5]`. The absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less. The current value of `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2` or the current value of `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, `answers` now contains the string 'Draw', and all other conditions about `clues` remain the same.
