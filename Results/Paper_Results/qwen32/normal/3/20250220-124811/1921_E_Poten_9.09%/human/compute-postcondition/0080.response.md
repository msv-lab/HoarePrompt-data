Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `answers` is a list that contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. If `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`, then `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, if both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have the same parity (both even or both odd) and `clues[3] == clues[5]`, then `answers` contains the string 'Bob'. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have different parity (one is even and the other is odd) and `clues[3] == clues[5]`, then `answers` contains the string 'Alice'. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, then `answers` contains either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' based on the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` and the values of the relevant `clues` elements.**
