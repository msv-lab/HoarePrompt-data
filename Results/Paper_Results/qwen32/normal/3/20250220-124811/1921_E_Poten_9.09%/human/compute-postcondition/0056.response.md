The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the `answers` list. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `answers` is a list containing the string `'Draw'`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2] <= clues[4]`, `clues[0] != 1`, one of `clues[2]` or `clues[4]` is even and the other is odd, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less, and either `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`**.
