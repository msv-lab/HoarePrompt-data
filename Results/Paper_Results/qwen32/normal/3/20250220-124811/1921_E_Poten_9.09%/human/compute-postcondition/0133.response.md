The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `answers` contains the string `'Draw'`.**
