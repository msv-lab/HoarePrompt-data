Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2]` <= `clues[4]`, and `clues[0]` != 1. Additionally, it is not the case that both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even or both are odd, meaning one of them is even and the other is odd. `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, the current value of `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1. It is also true that either `clues[1] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`.**
