Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `clues[2] <= clues[4]`, `clues[0] != 1`, and it is not the case that both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even or both are odd (one of them is even and the other is odd). Additionally, `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive. The variable `test_cases` still equals `t`. The `answers` list now contains one element, the string 'Alice'. The `clues` list remains unchanged, and all the conditions about the elements of `clues` still hold true.
