Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, and `answers` includes `'Draw'` if `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`. Otherwise, `answers` includes `'Alice'`.**
