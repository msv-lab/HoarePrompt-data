The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. However, the loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. Since `int(input())` must return a value greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust this value to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Let's break it down:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `int(input())` returned a value `x` which is greater than 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must return `x - 1` (which must still be greater than 0).

Since the loop uses `int(input())` to determine the number of iterations, we need to ensure that the next call to `int(input())` returns a value that is one less than the previous value but still greater than 0.

State: **The function `func_1()` has been executed, `func_2` does not have any parameters, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0 and less than the previous value**. 

However, to be more specific and adhere strictly to the requirement of adjusting only the objects in the loop head, we should state:

State: **The function `func_1()` has been executed, `func_2` does not have any parameters, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0**. 

Since we are not given the exact previous value of `int(input())`, we can only state that it must return a value greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
