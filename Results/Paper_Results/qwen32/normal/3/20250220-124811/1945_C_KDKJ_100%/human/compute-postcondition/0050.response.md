The code snippet `rsum = n - i` updates the value of `rsum` based on the current values of `n` and `i`. Given that `i` is `k + 2`, the new value of `rsum` will be `n - (k + 2)`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `k + 2`, `left` is `S[k + 2][0]`, `lsum` is `k + 2`, `right` is `count_not_0 - S[k + 2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (k + 2)`**. 

In natural language: The value of `rsum` is updated to `n - (k + 2)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
