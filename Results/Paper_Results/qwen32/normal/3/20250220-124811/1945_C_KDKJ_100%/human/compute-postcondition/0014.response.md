Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least 1 character, `s` is the next character in the string `a`, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`. If `a` is `'0'`, `x` is `1` and `y` is `1`. Otherwise, `x` is `0` and `y` is `2`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged. The matrix `S` reflects the updated value of `y` based on the initial condition of `a`.
