The code assigns the value `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]` to the variable `right`. 

Given the initial state, `S` is a list of lists where the last element is `[count_0, count_not_0]`. Therefore, `S[-1][1]` is `count_not_0`. 

Since `right` is being assigned `count_not_0 - S[i][1]`, the value of `right` will be `count_not_0 - y1` if `i` is 1, or `count_not_0 - yn` if `i` is `n` (the second last element in the list).

The variables `S`, `ans`, `n`, `left`, and `lsum` remain unchanged. The only change is the assignment of the new value to `right`.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`, `ans` is -1, `n` must be at least 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `count_not_0 - S[i][1]`.**
