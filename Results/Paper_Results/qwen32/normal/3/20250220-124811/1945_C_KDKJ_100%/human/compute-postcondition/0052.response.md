The code assigns the value of `i` to `ans`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `k + 2`, `left` is `S[k + 2][0]`, `lsum` is `k + 2`, `right` is `count_not_0 - S[k + 2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (k + 2)`, `ans` is `k + 2`**.
