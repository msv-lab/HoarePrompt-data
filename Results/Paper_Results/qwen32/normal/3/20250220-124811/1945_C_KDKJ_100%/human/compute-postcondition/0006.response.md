To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the given initial and intermediate states. The loop iterates based on the number of test cases read from the input. The loop head `for _ in range(int(input())):` will execute `func_1()` as many times as the integer value read from the input.

Given the intermediate states:
- After 1 iteration: `func_1()` has been executed once, and `int(input())` must have returned a value greater than 0.
- After 2 iterations: `func_1()` has been executed twice, and `int(input())` must have returned a value greater than 1.
- After 3 iterations: `func_1()` has been executed three times, and `int(input())` must have returned a value greater than 2.

From these states, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute `func_1()` until the number of iterations matches the value returned by `int(input())`. Therefore, after all iterations, `func_1()` will have been executed exactly `int(input())` times.

The final output state will be:
- The function `func_1()` has been executed `int(input())` times.
- `func_2` does not have any parameters, as it is not affected by the loop.
- The value of `int(input())` dictates the number of iterations, and thus the number of times `func_1()` is executed.

Output State: **The function `func_1()` has been executed `int(input())` times, `func_2` does not have any parameters.**
