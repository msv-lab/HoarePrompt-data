The code snippet `left = S[i][0]` updates the value of `left` to be the first element of the `i-th` sub-list in the list `S`. Given the initial state, `i` is `k + 1`, so `left` is updated to `S[k + 1][0]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `left` is `S[k + 1][0]`, `lsum` is `k + 1`, `right` is `count_not_0 - S[k + 1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (k + 1)`**.
