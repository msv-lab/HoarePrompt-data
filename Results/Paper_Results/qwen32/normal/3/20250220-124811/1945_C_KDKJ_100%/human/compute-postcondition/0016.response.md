The code appends a new list `[x, y]` to the matrix `S`. The values of `x` and `y` are determined by the initial conditions regarding the string `a` and its next character `s`. The initial state of `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`, and after appending, `S` becomes `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y]]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least 1 character, `s` is the next character in the string `a`, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y]]`. If `s` is `'0'`, then if `a` is `'0'`, `x` is `2` and `y` is `0`; otherwise, `x` is `1` and `y` is `1`. If `s` is not `'0'`, then if `a` is `'0'`, `x` is `1` and `y` is `1`; otherwise, `x` is `0` and `y` is `2`.**
