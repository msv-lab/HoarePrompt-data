Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then determines and prints the index `i` from 0 to `n` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`, while ensuring that the number of '0's in the left segment (up to index `i`) is at least half the length of that segment and the number of '1's in the right segment (from index `i` to the end) is at least half the length of that segment.**
