Postcondition: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`, `n` is at least 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `count_not_0 - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` holds true, `ans` remains -1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.**
