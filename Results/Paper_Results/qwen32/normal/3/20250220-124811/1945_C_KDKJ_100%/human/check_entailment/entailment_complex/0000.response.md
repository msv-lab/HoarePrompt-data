### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the optimal position to place a road in a village such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side. The residents' preferences are represented by a binary string, where '0' means they prefer the left side and '1' means they prefer the right side.

#### Key Points:
1. **Cumulative Counts**: The function `func_1` builds a cumulative count array `S` where each element `S[i]` contains the count of '0's and '1's up to the `i-1`-th house. This helps in quickly determining the number of residents preferring each side for any potential road position.
2. **Checking Conditions**: For each potential road position `i` (from 0 to `n`), the function checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half the number of houses on the left (`left * 2 >= lsum`) and if the number of '1's on the right side is at least half the number of houses on the right (`right * 2 >= rsum`).
3. **Optimal Position**: Among all valid positions, the function selects the one that minimizes the absolute difference from the middle of the village (`abs(n / 2 - i)`). If there are multiple such positions, it selects the smaller one.
4. **Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1` for each test case.

#### Execution States:
- The annotated states in the code match the intended logic of the problem.
- The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the cumulative counts and checks the conditions for each potential road position.
- The selection of the optimal position is done correctly by minimizing `abs(n / 2 - i)` among valid positions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the optimal position for the road in each test case. It efficiently handles the constraints and provides the correct output as per the problem description.
