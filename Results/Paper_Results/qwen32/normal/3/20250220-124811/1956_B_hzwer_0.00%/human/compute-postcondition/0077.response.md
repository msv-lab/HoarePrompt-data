Output State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. Specifically, for each `i` from `0` to `n-3` and for each `j` from `0` to `n-1`, `dp[i][j]` is calculated according to the rules defined in the loop. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[i][j]` is `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. The loop has completed all iterations with `i` ranging from `n - 3` down to `0` and `j` ranging from `n - 1` down to `0`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `dp` table will contain the maximum number of cards that can be collected for each possible starting point and number of cards left to consider, based on the occurrences of each card in the `cards` list. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged throughout the process.
