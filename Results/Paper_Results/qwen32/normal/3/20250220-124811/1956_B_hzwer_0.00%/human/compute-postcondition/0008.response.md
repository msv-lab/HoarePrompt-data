The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. Given the initial state, the only specific value we have is `dp[n - 1][0] = 0`. However, the exact value of `dp[i + 1][j]` is not specified because `i` is not defined in the initial state. 

Since the value of `dp[i][j]` is now set to `dp[i + 1][j]`, and we do not have a specific value for `dp[i + 1][j]`, we can only say that `dp[i][j]` takes on the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with `dp[i][j]` set to `dp[i + 1][j]`, `j` is `n-1`, and the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is `0`.**
