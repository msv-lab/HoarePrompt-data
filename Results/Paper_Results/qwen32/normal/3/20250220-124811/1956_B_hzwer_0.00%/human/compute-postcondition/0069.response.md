Postcondition: **The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. For each `j` from `0` to `n-1`, if `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[1][j]` is equal to `dp[2][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[1][j]` is `max(dp[2][j], dp[3][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[1][j]` is the maximum of `dp[2][j]`, `dp[3][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[2][j + 1]`. Specifically, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is equal to `dp[n - 2][n - 2]` if `cards.count(n - 1)` is 0; otherwise, it is `max(dp[n - 2][n - 2], dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1)` if `cards.count(n - 1)` is 1, and `max(dp[n - 2][n - 2], dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1, dp[n - 2][n - 1])` otherwise. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is `n - 3`, and `j` is `n - 2`.**
