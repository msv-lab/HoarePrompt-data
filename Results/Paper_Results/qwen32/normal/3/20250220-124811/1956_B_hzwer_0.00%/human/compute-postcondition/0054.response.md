The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute, `j` must be initialized to `n - 1`.

Given that `j` has already iterated from `n - 1` down to `0`, we need to adjust `j` to its starting value for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we set `j` to `n - 1`.

State: **`dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. For each `j` from `0` to `n-1`, if `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[1][j]` is equal to `dp[2][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[1][j]` is `max(dp[2][j], dp[3][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[1][j]` is the maximum of `dp[2][j]`, `dp[3][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[2][j + 1]`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is `n - 3`, and `j` is `n - 1`.**
