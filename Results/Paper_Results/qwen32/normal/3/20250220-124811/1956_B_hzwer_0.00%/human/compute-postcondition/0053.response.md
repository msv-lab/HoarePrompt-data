The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the loop statement, `i` iterates from `n - 3` down to `0` with a step of `-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `1`, which means the loop has just finished its last iteration because `i` would be decremented to `0` in the next step, and then the loop would terminate.

To execute one more time, `i` needs to be reset to the starting value of the loop, which is `n - 3`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. For each `j` from `0` to `n-1`, if `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[1][j]` is equal to `dp[2][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[1][j]` is `max(dp[2][j], dp[3][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[1][j]` is the maximum of `dp[2][j]`, `dp[3][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[2][j + 1]`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is `n - 3`, and `j` has iterated from `n - 1` down to `0`.**
