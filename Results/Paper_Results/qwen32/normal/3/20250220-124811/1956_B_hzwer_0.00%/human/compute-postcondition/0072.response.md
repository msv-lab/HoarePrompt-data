Output State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. Specifically, `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` is now equal to `max(dp[n - 2][n - 3], dp[n - 1][n - 4] + 1)`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is `n - 3`, and `j` is `n - 3`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` has been updated to be the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 3]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 4] + 1`. All other conditions and values remain the same.
