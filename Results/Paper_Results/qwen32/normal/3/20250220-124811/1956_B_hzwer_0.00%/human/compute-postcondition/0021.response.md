Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, and `j` is `n-2`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, then `dp[i][n-2]` has been updated to `dp[i + 1][n-2]`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, then `dp[i][n-2]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][n-2], dp[i + 2][n-3] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`.**
