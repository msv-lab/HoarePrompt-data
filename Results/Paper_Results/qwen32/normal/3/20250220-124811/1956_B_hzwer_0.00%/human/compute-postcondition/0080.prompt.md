You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` takes no arguments. The input is read from standard input where the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of cards each player receives. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` at most 2 times. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. Specifically, for each `i` from `0` to `n-3` and for each `j` from `0` to `n-1`, `dp[i][j]` is calculated according to the rules defined in the loop. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[i][j]` is `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. The loop has completed all iterations with `i` ranging from `n - 3` down to `0` and `j` ranging from `n - 1` down to `0`.
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the value of `dp[0][0]`, which reflects the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in the list `cards`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no arguments. It reads input from standard input, which includes multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes a list of integers representing cards. The function calculates and returns the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in the list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `dp[0][0]`, which reflects the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in the list `cards`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
