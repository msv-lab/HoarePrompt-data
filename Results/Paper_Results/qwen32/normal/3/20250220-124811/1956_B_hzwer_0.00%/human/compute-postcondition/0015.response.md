Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. If `j + 1` is not in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`. `j` is `n-1` throughout the execution.**
