Output State: **`n` is the integer value read from the input, representing the number of cards each player receives in the current test case; `cards` is a list of integers read from the input; `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to `0` except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is `0`.**

In simple terms, the value of `dp[n - 1][0]` has been explicitly set to `0`, while all other elements of the `dp` list remain `0`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged.
