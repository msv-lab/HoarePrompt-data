The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the for loop statement, `j` starts from `n - 1` and decrements down to `0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1.

Therefore, `j` should be `n - 3`.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `cards`, `dp`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[1][n - 1]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 1]` and `dp[1][n - 2]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 2]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[1][n - 1]` is `max(dp[2][n - 1], dp[3][n - 2] + 1)` and `dp[1][n - 2]` is `max(dp[2][n - 2], dp[3][n - 3] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[1][n - 1]` is the maximum of `dp[2][n - 1]`, `dp[3][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[2][n]`, and `dp[1][n - 2]` is `max(dp[2][n - 2], dp[3][n - 3] + 1, dp[2][n - 1])`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 3`, and `n` must be greater than 0**.
