The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1][j]` to `dp[i][j]`. Given that `j` is `n-3`, the value at `dp[i][n-3]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1][n-3]`. The other variables and their preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][n-3]` has been updated to `dp[i + 1][n-3]`, and `j` is `n-3`.**
