Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all values updated according to the loop's logic. `i` is 1
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
    elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[1][n - 1]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 1]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[1][n - 1]` is `max(dp[2][n - 1], dp[3][n - 2] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[1][n - 1]` is the maximum of `dp[2][n - 1]`, `dp[3][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[2][n]`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[1][n - 1]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 1]` and `dp[1][n - 2]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 2]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[1][n - 1]` is `max(dp[2][n - 1], dp[3][n - 2] + 1)` and `dp[1][n - 2]` is `max(dp[2][n - 2], dp[3][n - 3] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[1][n - 1]` is the maximum of `dp[2][n - 1]`, `dp[3][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[2][n]`, and `dp[1][n - 2]` is `max(dp[2][n - 2], dp[3][n - 3] + 1, dp[2][n - 1])`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 2`, and `n` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The `dp` table is fully updated after all iterations, with `dp[i][j]` values reflecting the maximum number of cards that can be collected based on the occurrences of each card in `cards`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 0, `dp[1][n - 1]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 1]` and `dp[1][n - 2]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 2]`, and `dp[1][n - 3]` is equal to `dp[2][n - 3]`. If `cards.count(j + 1)` is 1, `dp[1][n - 1]` is `max(dp[2][n - 1], dp[3][n - 2] + 1)`, `dp[1][n - 2]` is `max(dp[2][n - 2], dp[3][n - 3] + 1)`, and `dp[1][n - 3]` is updated to `max(dp[2][n - 3], dp[3][n - 4] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[1][n - 1]` is the maximum of `dp[2][n - 1]`, `dp[3][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[2][n]`, `dp[1][n - 2]` is `max(dp[2][n - 2], dp[3][n - 3] + 1, dp[2][n - 1])`, and `dp[1][n - 3]` is updated to `max(dp[2][n - 3], dp[3][n - 4] + 1, dp[2][n - 2])`. The values of `n` and `cards` remain unchanged, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 3`, and `n` must be greater than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
