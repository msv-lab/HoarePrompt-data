You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, and prints the smaller of the two followed by the larger one.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that runs `x` times, corresponding to the number of test cases.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input.
4. It then checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

This logic correctly identifies and prints the minimum and maximum of the two integers for each test case. The program adheres to the problem description by outputting the minimum followed by the maximum value for each pair of integers.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
