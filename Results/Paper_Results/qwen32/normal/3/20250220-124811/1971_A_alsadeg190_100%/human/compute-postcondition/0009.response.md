The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial state of `t` and `i` is not affected by this code snippet. The initial state of `x` and `y` is overwritten by the input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, where `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is between 0 and 9 inclusive; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.** 

In simple terms, `t` and `i` remain unchanged, but `x` and `y` are updated to the values provided by the input.
