Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, where `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is between 0 and 9 inclusive; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Regardless of whether `x` is less than `y` or not, the values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
