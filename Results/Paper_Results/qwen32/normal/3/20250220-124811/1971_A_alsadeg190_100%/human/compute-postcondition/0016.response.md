To determine the output of the `print(y, x)` statement, we need to understand the values of the variables `y` and `x` based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This variable does not affect the `print(y, x)` statement directly.
2. **x**: An integer provided by the input where \(x > 0\). The exact value of \(x\) is not specified, but it is known to be a positive integer.
3. **y**: An integer provided by the input where \(0 \leq y \leq 9\). The exact value of \(y\) is not specified, but it is known to be a single digit integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.
4. **i**: The statement `i is i + 1` suggests that `i` is being incremented by 1, but the initial value of `i` is not provided, and the value of `i` is not used in the `print(y, x)` statement.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The `print(y, x)` statement will output the values of `y` and `x` in that order. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe them based on the constraints given.

### Output:
The `print(y, x)` statement will print the value of `y` followed by the value of `x`. Given the constraints, `y` is a single digit integer between 0 and 9, and `x` is a positive integer.

Output: **y, x (where y is a single digit integer between 0 and 9, and x is a positive integer)**
