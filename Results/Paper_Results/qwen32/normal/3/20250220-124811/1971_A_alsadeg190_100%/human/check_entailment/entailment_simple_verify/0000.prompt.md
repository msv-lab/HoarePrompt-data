You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4

    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2

    6 9

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: `t` remains the same as the initial value, `x` and `y` hold the values from the last iteration, and `i` is equal to `x`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading two integers, `x` and `y`. It then correctly prints the minimum and maximum of the two integers in the required format. The logic used in the program is straightforward and covers all possible cases where `x` and `y` are within the specified range (0 to 9). The program handles scenarios where `x` is less than `y`, `x` is greater than `y`, and `x` is equal to `y` (as seen in the provided example). Therefore, the program meets the problem description for every potential case.
