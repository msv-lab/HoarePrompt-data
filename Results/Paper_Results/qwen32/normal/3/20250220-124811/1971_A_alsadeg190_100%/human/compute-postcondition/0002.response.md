The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. 

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` must be greater than 0, and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9. The values of `x` and `y` will be overwritten by the values provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, where `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is between 0 and 9 inclusive.**
