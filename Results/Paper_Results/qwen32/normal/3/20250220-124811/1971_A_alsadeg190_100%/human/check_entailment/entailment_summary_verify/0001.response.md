Reasoning:
The provided program and the function summary align with the problem description. Let's break down the program to ensure it meets the requirements:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, corresponding to the number of test cases.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input.
4. It checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the program. The logic used to determine the minimum and maximum values is straightforward and correct. The program reads the input as specified, processes each test case, and outputs the results in the correct format.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program adheres to the problem description and logic. There are no apparent issues or errors in the code.

Final: **True**
