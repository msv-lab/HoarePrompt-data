The code snippet `x = int(input())` will take an integer input and assign it to the variable `x`. This input will replace the previous value of `x` which was an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 9. The values of `t` and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `x` as provided by the input, while `t` and `y` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the input integer, `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9.**
