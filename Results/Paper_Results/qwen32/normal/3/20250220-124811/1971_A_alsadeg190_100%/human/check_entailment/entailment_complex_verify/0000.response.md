Reasoning: 
The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading two integers, `x` and `y`. For each pair of integers, it correctly prints the minimum value followed by the maximum value. The logic in the program is straightforward and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it correctly handles scenarios where `x` is less than `y`, `x` is greater than `y`, and `x` is equal to `y`. The annotations confirm that the program reads and processes the input correctly and outputs the results in the required format.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
