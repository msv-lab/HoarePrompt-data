The code modifies each element in the list `a` by adding the index of the element plus one to the element itself. 

Given the initial state, `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated such that each element `a_i` becomes `a_i + (i + 1)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` is updated to `a_i + (i + 1)`**.
