Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not guarantee the lexicographically largest array `b` as described in the problem statement. Here are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. **Order of Insertion**: The program calculates `a[i] + i + 1` for all elements and then sorts the unique values in descending order. However, the problem requires the elements to be inserted into the set `S` in a specific order based on the operations Stack performs, which is not captured by simply sorting the modified array.

2. **Handling Duplicates**: The program uses a `Counter` to keep track of occurrences and then appends duplicates based on the difference between consecutive elements. This approach does not correctly simulate the process of inserting elements into a set and then sorting the set in decreasing order after all operations.

3. **Constructing `b`**: The program attempts to construct `b` by appending elements and handling duplicates, but it does not correctly simulate the insertion process described in the problem statement.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the operations as described:
1. For each operation, choose the index `i` that maximizes `a[i] + i`.
2. Insert `a[i] + i` into the set `S`.
3. Remove `a[i]` from `a`.
4. After all operations, construct `b` by sorting the elements of `S` in decreasing order.

Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the correct approach:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for _ in range(n):
        max_val = -1
        max_index = -1
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != -1 and a[i] + i + 1 > max_val:
                max_val = a[i] + i + 1
                max_index = i
        s.add(max_val)
        a[max_index] = -1  # Mark as removed
    b = sorted(s, reverse=True)
    print(*b)
```

This corrected program simulates the process of selecting the maximum `a[i] + i` in each step, inserts the value into a set to avoid duplicates, and finally sorts the set in decreasing order to form `b`.
