Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least one element, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list, and `i` is greater than 0; `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(adv):
    ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least two elements where `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` and is non-negative, `ans` is a list containing the element `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, and `i` is greater than 0 such that `1 ≤ i < len(a)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least two elements where `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` and is non-negative, `ans` is a list containing the element `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and the newly appended element `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0 such that `1 ≤ i < len(a)`, `j` is `j + 1` from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `adv` is unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁴, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least two elements where `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1 > 0`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` and is non-negative, `ans` is a list containing three elements, each equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0 such that `1 ≤ i < len(a)`, `j` is `j + 1`, `adv` is unchanged




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
