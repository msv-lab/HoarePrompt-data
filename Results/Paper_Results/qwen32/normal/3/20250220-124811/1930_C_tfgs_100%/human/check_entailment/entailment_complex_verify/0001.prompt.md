You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It updates each element `a_i` in the list by adding `i + 1` to it, where `i` is the index of the element. It then processes the updated list to produce a new list `ans` that is printed. The final output is a sequence of integers derived from the processed list, ensuring that the sequence is constructed based on the frequencies and values of the updated list elements.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to perform a series of operations on an array `a` and a set `S` to produce the lexicographically largest array `b` from `S` after `n` operations. The operations are:
1. Select an index `i` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ |a|`.
2. Insert `a[i] + i` into `S` (if it's not already present).
3. Delete `a[i]` from `a`.

The goal is to maximize the lexicographical order of the sorted array `b` derived from `S`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program modifies `a` by adding the index (1-based) to each element, i.e., `a[i] += i + 1`.

3. **Set `S` Construction:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element in `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in reverse order.

4. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program calculates the number of elements that were removed due to being duplicates (`cnt = n - len(a)`).
   - It then iterates through the sorted set `a` and constructs the array `ans` by appending the elements in descending order.
   - It also handles the insertion of the missing elements between the existing elements in `ans` to account for duplicates.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the constructed array `ans`.

### Correctness Check:
The approach taken by the program is correct. Here's why:
- The program correctly modifies the array `a` by adding the index to each element.
- It uses a set to ensure that only unique elements are inserted into `S`.
- It sorts the unique elements in descending order.
- It handles duplicates correctly by inserting the missing elements between the existing elements in the resulting array `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to produce the lexicographically largest array `b` from the set `S` after performing the specified operations on the array `a`.

Correctness: **True**
