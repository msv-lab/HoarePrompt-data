The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 0 or 1, after the increment, `i` will be either 1 or 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `j`, `cnt`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `j` is 2. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is 1 and `i` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 2.**
