Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are newly input lists of integers, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `cnt` is either 0 or 1. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 1 and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 1.

After executing `cnt += 1`, the value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are newly input lists of integers, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `cnt` is either 1 or 2.**
