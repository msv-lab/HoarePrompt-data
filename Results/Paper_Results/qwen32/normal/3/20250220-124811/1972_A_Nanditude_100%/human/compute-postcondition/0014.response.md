The given code snippet increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial state specifies that `cnt` is either 0 or 1, depending on the condition `b[j] < a[i]`. Since we are only incrementing `cnt` by 1, we need to consider both cases:

1. If `cnt` was 0, it will now be 1.
2. If `cnt` was 1, it will now be 2.

The values of all other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the incremented value of `cnt` while keeping the other variables as they were.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the latest input, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `cnt` is either 1 or 2.**
