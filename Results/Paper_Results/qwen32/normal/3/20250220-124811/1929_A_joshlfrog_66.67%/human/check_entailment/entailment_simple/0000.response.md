### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this sum, the optimal strategy is to arrange the elements in increasing or decreasing order.

For an increasing order arrangement, the beauty would be the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This is because the differences between consecutive elements would be maximized when the elements are in increasing order. Similarly, for a decreasing order arrangement, the beauty would again be the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

The provided program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum values of the array and prints their difference, which is indeed the maximum possible beauty of the array.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array for each test case. This approach is optimal and aligns with the problem's requirements.
