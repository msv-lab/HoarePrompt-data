The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. Therefore, `y` is now equal to `nums[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `nums`, `e`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `e` is `e + 1`, `i` is the current index + 1, `x` remains unchanged, `y` is `nums[i]`.**
