You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and the loop has completed `t` iterations. For each iteration `e` (where 0 <= e < t), an integer `l` was read, followed by a list `nums` of `l` integers. The loop printed the difference between the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values in `nums` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `l` and a list of `l` integers. It then calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The given program instead calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array, which does not correspond to the required beauty calculation. To illustrate, let's consider a test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5
100 54 80 43 90
```

**Expected Output:**
```
57
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To maximize the beauty, we can rearrange the array as [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. The beauty is calculated as:
(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57.

**Actual Output of Provided Program:**
```
97
```

The provided program calculates the difference between the maximum (100) and minimum (43) values of the array, which is 57, but this is not the correct way to compute the beauty as described in the problem. The program is not implementing the required logic to maximize the beauty of the array by considering the differences between consecutive elements in an optimal arrangement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
