The code snippet provided initializes a variable `x` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `nums`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is 0.**
