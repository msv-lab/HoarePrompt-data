The code snippet assigns the value `100000000` to the variable `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is the integer value obtained from the input, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000, `e` is `e + 1`.**
