Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is the integer value obtained from the input, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `x` is 0, `y` is the minimum value in the previous `nums` from index 0 to `l-1`, `e` is `e + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `x` has been updated to 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
