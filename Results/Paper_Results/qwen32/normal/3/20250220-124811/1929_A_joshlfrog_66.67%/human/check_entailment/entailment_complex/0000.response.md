Reasoning:  
The program is intended to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the optimal arrangement of the array is to sort it in ascending order. This way, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

However, the given program does not sort the array. Instead, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. This approach does not yield the correct result for the maximum beauty as defined in the problem.

For example, consider the first test case in the problem statement:
- Input: 3, 2 1 3
- The program calculates the difference between the max (3) and min (1) values, which is 2.
- However, the correct arrangement to maximize beauty is [1, 2, 3], resulting in a beauty of (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2.

While the program produces the correct output for this specific test case, it does not generalize to all cases. For instance, in the third test case:
- Input: 5, 100 54 80 43 90
- The program calculates the difference between the max (100) and min (43) values, which is 57.
- The correct arrangement to maximize beauty is [43, 54, 80, 90, 100], resulting in a beauty of (54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 57.
- Although the program gives the correct answer here, it is not due to the correct logic. The program's logic would fail in other cases.

Correctness: **False**
