To determine the output of the `print(x - y)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

From the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 (though `a` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `l` is an input integer (though `l` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`.
- `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.

The `print(x - y)` statement will output the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `x - y`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `nums`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value in the list `nums` and y is the minimum value in the list `nums`)**
