Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is greater than `i + 1`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `e` is `e + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `nums[i] > x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.**
