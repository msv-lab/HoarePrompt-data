The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer input by the user, `i` is 1, and the conditions regarding `a`, `b`, and `c` are specified. The code does not affect `t` and `i`, but it does assign new values to `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input. If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true.**

This means the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now set to the integers read from the input, and the conditions regarding these variables are evaluated based on their new values. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
