The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`) and their relationships. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of these variables. The statement `print('STAIRS')` will output the string 'STAIRS' regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Given the precondition and the code snippet, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **STAIRS**
