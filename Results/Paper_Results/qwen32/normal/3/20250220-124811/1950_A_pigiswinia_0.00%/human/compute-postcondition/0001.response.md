The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. Since `t` is already defined as an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts, as Python's `range(t)` starts from 0 by default.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0**
