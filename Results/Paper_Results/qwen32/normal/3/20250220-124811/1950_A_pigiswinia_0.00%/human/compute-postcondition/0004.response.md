The `print('STAIRS')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'STAIRS'. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but none of these variables are used in the print statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the print statement.

Output: **STAIRS**
