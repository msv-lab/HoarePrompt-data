Based on the provided initial state and the Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `i` is initialized to 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.
- There are specific conditions on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`:
  - If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds.
  - If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds.
  - Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply outputs the string `'PEAK'`. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not influence what is printed because the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It directly prints the string `'PEAK'`.

### Output:
Output: **PEAK**
