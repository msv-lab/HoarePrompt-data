Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `t` is an integer input by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.
- It is explicitly stated that `a < b > c`, meaning `b` is the largest among the three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

The code snippet to be executed is:

```python
print('PEAK')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **PEAK**
