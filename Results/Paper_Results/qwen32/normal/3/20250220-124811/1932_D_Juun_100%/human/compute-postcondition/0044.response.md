The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 50, `n` is 8, `trump` is 'H', `trumps` is ['A', 'K'], `answers` is ['23', '45', 'HQ QH'], `suits` is {'C': None, 'D': ['6', '7'], 'H': None, 'S': None}, `suit` is 'S', `rank` is None**.
