Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump` is a single character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; `rank` is the rank of the current card (a character from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'}); `suit` is the suit of the current card (a character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}); the description of 2n cards is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'} and the second character is a suit from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; `trumps` is a list containing the `rank` of the current card if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is either an empty list or a list with one additional string entry formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with the `suit` character; `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S', and the value for the key `suit` is updated to `rank` if `suits[suit]` is not `None` and `suit` is not equal to `trump`; `card` is the next card in the list of card descriptions; `rank` and `suit` have been updated to the rank and suit of `card`.**
