The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `trumps`. No other variables are modified, and the preconditions for the variables `t`, `n`, `trump`, and the list of 2n cards remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 16; `trump` is a single character from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; the description of 2n cards is a list of 2n distinct two-character strings, where the first character is a rank from the set {'2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'} and the second character is a suit from the set {'C', 'D', 'H', 'S'}; `trumps` is an empty list.**
