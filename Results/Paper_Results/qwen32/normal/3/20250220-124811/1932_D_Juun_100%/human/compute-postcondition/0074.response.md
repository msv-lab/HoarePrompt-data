Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input values including the number of test cases, the number of cards, the trump suit, and the list of cards. It processes these cards to form pairs, prioritizing trumps and non-trump pairs of the same suit. The function prints out the pairs or 'IMPOSSIBLE' if it cannot form the required pairs. The function does not return any value.**
