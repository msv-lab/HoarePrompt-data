Postcondition: **`t` is 50, `n` is 8, `trump` is 'H', `trumps` is either `['A']` or `[]`, `answers` is either `['23', '45', 'HQ QH']` or `['23', '45', 'HQ QH', 'NoneSH KH']`, `suits` is `{'C': None, 'D': ['6', '7'], 'H': None, 'S': None}`, `suit` is 'S', and `rank` is None. If `trumps` is not empty, then `trumps` is `['A']` and `answers` is `['23', '45', 'HQ QH', 'NoneSH KH']`. Otherwise, the function returns None.**
