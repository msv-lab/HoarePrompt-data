Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `n`, `a`, and `b` are each integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if b <= a:
        print(n * a)
    elif b - a >= n:
        print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
    else:
        print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then no further changes are made to `n`, `a`, or `b`. Otherwise, `b` is greater than `a`, and if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`. If `b - a` is less than `n`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are the integers read from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made to `n`, `a`, or `b`. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than `a` and `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`. If `b` is greater than `a` and `b - a` is less than `n`, the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are the integers read from the input. If `b <= a`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, the condition `b - a >= n` is evaluated, but it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
