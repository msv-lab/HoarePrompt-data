To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State
- `t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. (Note: `t` is not used in the `print` statement, so its value does not affect the output.)
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are the integers read from the input.

### Code Snippet
```python
print(n * a)
```

### Analysis
The `print` statement calculates the product of `n` and `a` and then prints the result. The value of `b` is not used in this particular `print` statement, so it does not affect the output.

### Output Description
The output will be the product of the integers `n` and `a`. Since the specific values of `n` and `a` are not given, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Answer
Output: **n * a (where n and a are the integers read from the input)**
