Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for all cases. Specifically, the third condition in the program is incorrect. The logic needs to consider the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the modified price to maximize profit.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            # Calculate the optimal k
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            # Calculate the profit
            profit = (b + b - k + 1) * k // 2 + (n - k) * a
            print(profit)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- If \( b \le a \), all buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
- Otherwise, the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the modified price is \( \min(b - a + 1, n) \).
- The profit from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price is calculated using the sum of an arithmetic series.
- The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

This ensures that the maximum profit is calculated correctly for all cases.
