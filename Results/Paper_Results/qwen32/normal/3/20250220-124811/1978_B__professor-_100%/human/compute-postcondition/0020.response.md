The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on the new input, and the variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet as it is not mentioned in the code.

Output State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are the integers read from the input.**
