To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the code and the initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1` (this doesn't affect the print statement directly, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no further changes are made to `n`, `a`, or `b`.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, and if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`.
- If `b - a` is less than `n`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.

### The Print Statement:
```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
```

### Analysis:
The print statement calculates and prints the integer value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

Let's break down the expression:
- `2 * b`: This is twice the value of `b`.
- `2 * b - n`: This subtracts `n` from `2 * b`.
- `2 * b - n + 1`: This adds 1 to the result of the previous step.
- `(2 * b - n + 1) * n`: This multiplies the result of the previous step by `n`.
- `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`: This performs integer division of the result by 2.

### Output:
The output of the print statement will be the integer value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

Since we don't have specific values for `n`, `a`, and `b`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2 (where n, a, and b are integers read from the input)**

This describes the value that will be printed based on the given initial state and the provided formula.
