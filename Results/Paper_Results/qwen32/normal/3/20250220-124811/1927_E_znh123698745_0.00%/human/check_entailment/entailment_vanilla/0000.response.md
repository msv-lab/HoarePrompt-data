To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements of constructing a k-level permutation for each test case. Let's break down the problem and the program step by step:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Permutation Construction**:
   - We need to construct a permutation of length `n` using distinct integers from `1` to `n`.
   - The permutation should be such that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than `1`.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For a permutation to be k-level, the sums of segments of length `k` should be as balanced as possible.
   - One approach to achieve this is to alternate between the smallest and largest available numbers, which can help in balancing the sums of segments of length `k`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Array Construction**:
   - It constructs an array `array` containing integers from `1` to `n`.

3. **Answer Construction**:
   - It initializes `answer` with the first element `1`.
   - It uses a list `a` to keep track of the indices for picking elements from `array` in an alternating manner.
   - The program alternates between picking elements from the beginning and the end of the `array` based on the parity of the index `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation for each test case.

### Evaluation

Let's evaluate if the program indeed constructs a k-level permutation:

- The program alternates between picking the smallest and largest available numbers. This strategy can help in balancing the sums of segments of length `k`.
- However, the specific alternating pattern used (`a = [1, -1]` and the way it's updated) does not guarantee that the sums of segments of length `k` will differ by no more than `1` for all cases.

### Counterexample

Consider the test case `n = 4, k = 2`:
- The program will output a permutation like `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
- The sums of segments of length `2` are `[1+4, 4+2, 2+3] = [5, 6, 5]`.
- Here, the maximum sum is `6` and the minimum sum is `5`, which satisfies the k-level condition.

However, consider the test case `n = 5, k = 2`:
- The program will output a permutation like `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`.
- The sums of segments of length `2` are `[1+5, 5+2, 2+4, 4+3] = [6, 7, 6, 7]`.
- Here, the maximum sum is `7` and the minimum sum is `6`, which also satisfies the k-level condition.

But let's consider a more complex case, such as `n = 10, k = 4`:
- The program will output a permutation like `[1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 5, 6]`.
- The sums of segments of length `4` are `[1+10+2+9, 10+2+9+3, 2+9+3+8, 9+3+8+4, 3+8+4+7, 8+4+7+5, 4+7+5+6] = [22, 24, 22, 24, 22, 24, 22]`.
- Here, the maximum sum is `24` and the minimum sum is `22`, which satisfies the k-level condition.

Upon closer inspection, it seems that the provided program's strategy does indeed balance the sums of segments of length `k` in a way that satisfies the k-level condition for the given constraints.

### Conclusion

The program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
