The code snippet assigns a new list `[1, -1]` to the variable `a`. The variables `n`, `k`, `array`, and `answer` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `answer` is [1]; `a` is [1, -1]**.
