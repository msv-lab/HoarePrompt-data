The value of `a[0]` is incremented by 1. Given that `a` is initially `[1, -1]`, `a[0]` changes from 1 to 2. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `answer` is [1, 2], `a` is [2, -1], `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Output State: **`answer` is [1, 2], `a` is [2, -1], `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.**
