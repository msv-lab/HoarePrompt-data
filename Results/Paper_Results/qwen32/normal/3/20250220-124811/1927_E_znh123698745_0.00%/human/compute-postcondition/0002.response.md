The code snippet creates a list named `array` that contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.**
