The code snippet provided decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. Given the initial state, the list `a` is `[1, -1]`. After the operation `a[-1] -= 1`, the last element of `a` (which is `-1`) is decremented by `1`, resulting in `-2`. 

The other variables (`iterations - 1`, `n`, `k`, `array`, `answer`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **the number of remaining iterations is `iterations - 1`; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` are integers read from input; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `answer` is `[1, n]`; `a` is `[1, -2]`; `i` is such that `((-1)`**
