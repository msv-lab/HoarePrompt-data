The value of `a[0]` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `a` can be one of three lists: `[1, -3]`, `[2, -2]`, or `[3, -1]`. After the increment, `a` will be `[2, -3]`, `[3, -2]`, or `[4, -1]` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`answer` is either `[1, n, n-1, 2]`, `[1, n, n, 2]`, `[1, n, 2, 2]`, `[1, n, 3, 2]`, `[1, 2, 2, 2]`, or `[1, 2, 3, 2]`; or `[1, n, n-1, 3]`, `[1, n, n, 3]`, `[1, n, 2, 3]`, `[1, n, 3, 3]`, `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, or `[1, 2, 3, 3]`; or `[1, n, n-1, 4]`, `[1, n, n, 4]`, `[1, n, 2, 4]`, `[1, n, 3, 4]`, `[1, 2, 2, 4]`, or `[1, 2, 3, 4]`; `a` is either `[2, -3]`, `[3, -2]`, or `[4, -1]`; `n` is greater than 4; `k` is an input integer; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is 4**.
