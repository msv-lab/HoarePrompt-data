Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `answer` is [1]; `a` is [1, -1]
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if (-1) ** i == -1:
        answer.append(array[a[-1]])
        a[-1] -= 1
    else:
        answer.append(array[a[0]])
        a[0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `(-1)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is `n-1`. If `i` is odd (which it is, since `i` is `n-1` and `n` is at least 2), `answer` contains the element `n`. Otherwise, `answer` contains the element at index `a[0]` of `array`, and `a[0]` has been incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is 1; `a` is a list containing the integer `0`. If `i` is odd, `answer` contains the elements `n` and `1`. If `i` is even, `a[0]` is incremented by 1 and `answer` contains the elements `n` and `array[0]` (which is the element at the original `a[0]` index of `array` before the increment).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
