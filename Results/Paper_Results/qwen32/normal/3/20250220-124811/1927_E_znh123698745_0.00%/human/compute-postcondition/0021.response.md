The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. Given the initial state, `a` is a list containing the integer `1`. Therefore, the last element of `a` is `1`, and after decrementing it by `1`, the value becomes `0`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is 1; `answer` contains the elements `n` and `1`; `a` is a list containing the integer `0`.**
