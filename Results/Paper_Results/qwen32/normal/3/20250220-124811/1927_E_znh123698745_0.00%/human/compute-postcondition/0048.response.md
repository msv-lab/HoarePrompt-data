The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. Given the initial state, `a` can be one of `[1, -3]`, `[2, -2]`, or `[3, -1]`. The last element of `a` will be decremented by 1 in each case.

1. If `a` is `[1, -3]`, after the operation, `a` becomes `[1, -4]`.
2. If `a` is `[2, -2]`, after the operation, `a` becomes `[2, -3]`.
3. If `a` is `[3, -1]`, after the operation, `a` becomes `[3, -2]`.

The values of `answer`, `n`, `k`, `array`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`answer` is either `[1, n, n-1, n-2]`, `[1, n, n, n-2]`, `[1, n, 2, n-2]`, `[1, n, 3, n-2]`, `[1, 2, 2, n-2]`, `[1, 2, 3, n-2]`, `[1, n, n-1, n-1]`, `[1, n, n, n-1]`, `[1, n, 2, n-1]`, `[1, n, 3, n-1]`, `[1, 2, 2, n-1]`, `[1, 2, 3, n-1]`, `[1, n, n-1, n]`, `[1, n, n, n]`, `[1, n, 2, n]`, `[1, n, 3, n]`, `[1, 2, 2, n]`, or `[1, 2, 3, n]`; `a` is either `[1, -4]`, `[2, -3]`, or `[3, -2]`; `n` is greater than 4; `k` is an input integer; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `i` is 4.**
