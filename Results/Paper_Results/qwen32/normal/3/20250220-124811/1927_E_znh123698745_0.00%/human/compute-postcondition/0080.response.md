To determine the output of the `print(*answer)` statement, we need to analyze the structure of the `answer` list based on the initial state provided.

1. **Variables and List Initialization:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from input.
   - `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `answer` is constructed such that it alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements of the `array` list.

2. **Structure of `answer`:**
   - If `n` is even, `answer` will be `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n/2, (n/2)+1]`.
   - If `n` is odd, `answer` will be `[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., (n//2), (n//2)+1, (n//2)+2]`.

3. **The `print(*answer)` Statement:**
   - The `*` operator in the `print(*answer)` statement unpacks the `answer` list and prints each element separated by spaces.

Let's break down the `answer` list construction:
- For even `n`: The list starts with 1 and ends with `n`, then alternates between the next smallest and next largest remaining numbers.
- For odd `n`: The list still alternates but ends with the middle number `(n//2) + 1`.

**Example Calculation:**
- If `n = 6` (even), `answer` will be `[1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]`.
- If `n = 5` (odd), `answer` will be `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can describe the output in a general form.

**Output Description:**
- The `print(*answer)` statement will print the elements of the `answer` list, which is constructed by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements of the list from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n/2, (n/2)+1 (for even n) or 1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., (n//2), (n//2)+1, (n//2)+2 (for odd n)**
