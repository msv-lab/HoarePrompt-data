The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` modifies the last element of the list `a`. Initially, `a` is `[1, -1]`, so the last element `a[-1]` is `-1`. After subtracting 1 from `-1`, the new value of `a[-1]` becomes `-2`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `array`, `answer`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive; `answer` is [1, n]; `a` is [1, -2]; `i` is an integer such that `(-1)`**
