Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It is typically used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the provided snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.
