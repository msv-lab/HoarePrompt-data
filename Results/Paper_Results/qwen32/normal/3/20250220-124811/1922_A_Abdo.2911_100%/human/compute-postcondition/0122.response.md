The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop structure provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect in this context. Therefore, none of the variables will be altered.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `i` is 3.**
