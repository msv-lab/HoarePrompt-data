Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, and `possible` is either `True` or `False` based on the initial value of `possible`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to the new string provided by the user input, which is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `b`, `c`, and `possible`) retain their initial values.
