You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Template Matching Conditions**:
   - If a character in the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in the string must match it.
   - If a character in the template is uppercase, the corresponding character in the string must be different from the lowercase version of it.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not.

3. **Logic to Determine Template**:
   - For each position `i` in the strings, check:
     - If `a[i] == b[i]`, then the template character at position `i` should be uppercase (different from `a[i]` and `b[i]`), and `c[i]` should not match `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
     - If `a[i] != b[i]`, then the template character at position `i` can be either uppercase or lowercase, provided `c[i]` does not match both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program iterates through each test case.
- For each string length `n`, it reads strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It then checks each character position `i`:
  - If `a[i] == b[i]`, it checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`. If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
  - If `a[i] != b[i]`, it checks if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
  - If none of the conditions are met, it continues to the next position.
- If `possible` is `True` after checking all positions, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check:
- The logic correctly checks the conditions to determine if a template can exist such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.
- The program correctly handles both cases (`a[i] == b[i]` and `a[i] != b[i]`).
- The program breaks the loop as soon as it finds a valid position, which is efficient.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
