Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is at least 1 (though its exact value is not needed for this print statement).
- `n` is an integer input by the user, where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\).
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `possible` is a boolean variable set to `True`.
- The loop has broken early due to one of the conditions being met.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. The value of `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the code and does not depend on any variables or conditions in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `possible`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
