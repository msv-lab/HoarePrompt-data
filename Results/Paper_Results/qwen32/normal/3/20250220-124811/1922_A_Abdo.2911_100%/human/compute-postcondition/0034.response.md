The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables directly but controls the flow of the loop. In this case, since there is no loop explicitly mentioned, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, `i` is incremented by 1**.
