Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 3, and `possible` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of all variables remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
