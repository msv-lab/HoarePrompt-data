Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `i` is 3. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the program continues as is. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
