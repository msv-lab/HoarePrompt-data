Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each. If the loop breaks early due to one of the conditions being met, `possible` is `True`; otherwise, `possible` is `False`.**
