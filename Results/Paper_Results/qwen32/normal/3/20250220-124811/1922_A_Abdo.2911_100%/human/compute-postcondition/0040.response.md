Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, and `possible` is `True`. The loop has broken early due to one of the conditions being met.**
