You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2

    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, for each test case n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: t is 0, n is the last integer value provided by the user, a, b, and c are the last strings of exactly n lowercase Latin letters provided by the user, and possible is True if any condition within the loop was met during any iteration, otherwise False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. For each test case, it checks if there is any position `i` where the character in `c` does not match the character in either `a` or `b` if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, or if `c[i]` does not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]` if they are different. It prints 'YES' if such a position exists for any test case, otherwise it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Let's analyze the provided code to see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Code Analysis:
The code attempts to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Here's the core logic:

```python
possible = False
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break
```

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Handling of Matching Characters in `a` and `b`:**
   - If `a[i] == b[i]`, the code checks if `c[i] != a[i]`. If true, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks the loop.
   - However, this logic is not sufficient. The template `t` should allow any uppercase letter that is different from the lowercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`. The code does not ensure that `t[i]` can be any uppercase letter except `a[i].upper()` or `b[i].upper()`. For example, if `a[i] == b[i] == 'a'` and `c[i] == 'b'`, the code incorrectly sets `possible` to `True` because `c[i] != a[i]`.

2. **Handling of Non-Matching Characters in `a` and `b`:**
   - If `a[i] != b[i]`, the code checks if `c[i] == a[i]` or `c[i] == b[i]`. If true, it continues to the next character.
   - If `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the code sets `possible` to `True` and breaks the loop.
   - This logic is also flawed. The template `t` should allow any uppercase letter that is different from the lowercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`. The code does not ensure that `t[i]` can be any uppercase letter except `a[i].upper()` or `b[i].upper()`. For example, if `a[i] == 'a'`, `b[i] == 'b'`, and `c[i] == 'c'`, the code incorrectly sets `possible` to `True` because `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following input:
```
1
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- For `i = 0`, `a[0] == 'a'` and `b[0] == 'a'`. The code checks if `c[0] != a[0]`, which is true (`c[0] == 'a'`). However, the correct template `t` could be "AB" (or any other uppercase letters except 'a'), which would match `a` and `b` but not `c`.
- For `i = 1`, `a[1] == 'a'` and `b[1] == 'b'`. The code checks if `c[1] == a[1]` or `c[1] == b[1]`, which is true (`c[1] == 'b'`). The code continues to the next character.
- The code incorrectly determines that `possible` is `False` and prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
