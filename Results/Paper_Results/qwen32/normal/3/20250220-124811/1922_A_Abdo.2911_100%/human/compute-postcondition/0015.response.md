Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `possible` is False, and for the current index `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. Additionally, `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to any variables, the output state is the same as the initial state.
