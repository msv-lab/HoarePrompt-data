The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be exactly what is specified in the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is set to 1.
2. The variable `n` is an integer value provided by the user.
3. The variable `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user.
4. The variable `b` is another string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user.
5. The variable `c` is yet another string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user.
6. The variable `possible` is set to `False`.

Despite these variables being defined, the `print` statement does not use any of them. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
