The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.

Here is the breakdown:
- `t` is defined as `t - 1`, but this doesn't affect the print statement.
- `n` is an integer input by the user, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, provided by the user.
- `possible` is set to `True`, but it is not used in the print statement.

Since the `print` statement only outputs the string `'YES'`, the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible` do not influence the output.

Output: **YES**
