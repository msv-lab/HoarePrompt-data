The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and for some index `i`, `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`. The current value of `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`. `possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
