Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is defined as `t - 1`. However, the initial value of `t` is not provided, so this doesn't affect the `print` statement directly.
- `n` is an integer value provided by the user input, and it is within the range 1 to 20.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input.
- `possible` is set to `False`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.
- None of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `possible` are used in the `print` statement, so their values do not influence the output.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
