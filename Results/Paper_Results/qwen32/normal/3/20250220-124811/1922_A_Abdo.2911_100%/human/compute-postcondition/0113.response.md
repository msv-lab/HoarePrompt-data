The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in this given code snippet, there is no loop structure (`for` or `while`). Therefore, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the program flow, and none of the variables will be altered.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`. `i` is 2**.
