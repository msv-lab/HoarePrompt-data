Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and the `i`-th character of `a` is not equal to the `i`-th character of `b`. If the `i`-th character of `c` is equal to either the `i`-th character of `a` or the `i`-th character of `b`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `possible` is `True`.**
