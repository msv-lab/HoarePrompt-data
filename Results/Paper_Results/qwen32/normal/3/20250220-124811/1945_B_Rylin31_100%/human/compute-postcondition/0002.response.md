The code snippet provided is reading three integers from the input and assigning them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. This means that the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are being overwritten with the new values obtained from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a`, `b`, and `m` are each integers with values obtained from the input.**
