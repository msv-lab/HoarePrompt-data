Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The approach used in the program, which is `m // a + m // b + 2`, is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Overlap Calculation**: The formula does not account for the overlap of fireworks' visibility periods. For example, if fireworks from both installations are launched at the same time, they should be counted only once in the visibility period.
2. **Visibility Periods**: The formula does not consider the actual visibility periods of the fireworks. It simply adds the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m` and adds 2, which is not a valid way to determine the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.
3. **Mathematical Misinterpretation**: The formula does not use any mathematical concept that would allow it to determine the maximum overlap of fireworks' visibility periods.

To correctly solve the problem, one should calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the periodicity of overlapping fireworks' launch times. Then, within each period, one should determine the number of fireworks from both installations that are visible at the same time.

Correctness: **False**
