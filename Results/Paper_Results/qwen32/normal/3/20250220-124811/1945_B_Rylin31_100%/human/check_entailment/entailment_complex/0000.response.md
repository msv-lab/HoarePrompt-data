Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used in the program, `m // a + m // b + 2`, does not account for the simultaneous visibility of fireworks from both installations at overlapping times. Instead, it simply sums the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and adds 2, which is not the correct approach.

The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of overlapping launches. Then, we need to count how many fireworks from each installation are visible within a period of `m` minutes, taking into account overlaps.

Here's a correct implementation outline:
1. Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m`.
3. Adjust for overlaps by considering the periodicity given by the LCM.

Given the incorrect logic in the provided program, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
