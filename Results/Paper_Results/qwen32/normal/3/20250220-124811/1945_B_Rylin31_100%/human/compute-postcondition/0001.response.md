The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 up to `t-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` do not affect whether the loop executes, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are each integers with values between 1 and 10^18**
