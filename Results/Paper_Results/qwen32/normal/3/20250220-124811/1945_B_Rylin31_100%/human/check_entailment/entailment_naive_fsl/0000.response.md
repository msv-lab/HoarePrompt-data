Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is flawed and does not account for the simultaneous visibility of fireworks launched from both installations.

The current implementation simply adds the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m` and adds 2, which does not correctly account for the overlaps in visibility times.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
2 3 5
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Explanation:
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times 2, 4, and 6.
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times 3 and 6.
- The fireworks launched at time 6 are visible from time 6 to 11, which overlaps with fireworks launched at times 4 and 6 from the first installation.
- Therefore, at time 6, there are 3 fireworks visible (one from each launch at 4, 6, and 6).

However, the given program would output `5 // 2 + 5 // 3 + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5`, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of overlapping fireworks and count the number of fireworks visible at each time point within the range `[0, m]`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        max_fireworks = 0
        for t in range(m + 1):
            count = (t // a) + (t // b) - (t // lcm_ab)
            max_fireworks = max(max_fireworks, count)
        print(max_fireworks)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected version iterates through each minute within the visibility period and calculates the number of fireworks visible at that minute, taking into account the overlaps using the LCM. It then keeps track of the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time.
