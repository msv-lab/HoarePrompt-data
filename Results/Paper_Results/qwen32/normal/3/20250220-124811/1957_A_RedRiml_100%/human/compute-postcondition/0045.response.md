The code snippet provided sets the dictionary `d` to an empty dictionary. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, or `shapes`. Therefore, the only change is that `d` is now an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w - 1`, where `w` is greater than 1; `ln` is the new input integer; `palka` is a new list of integers from the input; `d` is an empty dictionary; `pl` is an empty list; `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**
