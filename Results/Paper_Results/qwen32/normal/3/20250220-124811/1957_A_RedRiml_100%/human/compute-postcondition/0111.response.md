The code snippet `shapes += d[j] // 3` increments the value of `shapes` by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3. Since `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `d[j] // 3` will be a positive integer or zero if `d[j]` is exactly 3. The list `pl` and the elements of `d` other than `d[j]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` and must have at least one element; `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3; `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3`.**
