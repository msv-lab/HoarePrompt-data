The only variable in the loop head is `j` and the iterable is `pl`. For the loop to execute, `pl` must be an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) with at least one element. The variable `j` is the loop variable that will take the value of each element in `pl` one by one during each iteration. The state of `t` and `shapes` does not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

To ensure the loop executes, `pl` must have at least one element. Therefore, `pl` should be initialized as a non-empty iterable.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `shapes` is 0, `pl` is a non-empty iterable**
