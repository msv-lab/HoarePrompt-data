The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is the next value in the iterable `pl`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `j` to the next value in `pl`.

Given:
- `t` is unchanged.
- `shapes` is updated to `shapes + d[j] // 3` if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `shapes` remains unchanged.
- `pl` is a non-empty iterable.
- `j` is the next value in `pl` at the end of the previous iteration.

To proceed with the next iteration:
- `j` needs to be updated to the next value in `pl`.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `shapes` is `shapes` + `d[j] // 3` if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `shapes` remains unchanged, `pl` is a non-empty iterable, `j` is the next value in `pl`**.

Since we need to specify the exact state at the start of the next iteration, let's denote the next value in `pl` as `j_next`.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `shapes` is `shapes` + `d[j] // 3` if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `shapes` remains unchanged, `pl` is a non-empty iterable, `j` is `j_next`**.
