The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and it iterates over the list `pl`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `pl` contains at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`, and `shapes`) are not directly related to the execution of the loop itself.

To ensure the loop executes, `pl` must contain at least one unique integer from `palka`.

State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `palka`; `pl` is a list that contains each unique integer from `palka` in the order they first appear and must have at least one element; `shapes` is 0**
