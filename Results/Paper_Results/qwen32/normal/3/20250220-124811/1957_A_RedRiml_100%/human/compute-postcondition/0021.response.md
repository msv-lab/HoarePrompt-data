The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable iterating over `palka`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next element in `palka`. 

Given that `i` is the next element in `palka` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to move to the subsequent element in `palka` for the next iteration.

Let's denote the current index of `i` in `palka` as `current_index`. Since `i` is the next element in `palka` at the end of the previous iteration, `current_index` should be incremented by 1 to get the index for the next iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has at least 1 integer; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is `1` if `i` was not previously a key in `d`, or `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already a key in `d`; `pl` includes the integer `i` if it was not already in `pl`; `i` is the next element in `palka`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be the next element in `palka`, which means `i` should be `palka[current_index + 1]`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `current_index` from the previous iteration, we can denote the new `i` as the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.

State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has at least 1 integer; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is `1` if `i` was not previously a key in `d`, or `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already a key in `d`; `pl` includes the integer `i` if it was not already in `pl`; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.**
