You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: `t` remains the initial value of `w`; `w` is unchanged; `ln`, `palka`, `d`, and `pl` hold the values from the last test case; `shapes` holds the number of shapes that can be formed in the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of sticks and their respective lengths. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the sticks, where each triangle requires three sticks of the same length.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks. Each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick, and no stick can be used in more than one polygon.

### Key Points:
1. A regular polygon must have at least 3 sides.
2. For a given stick length, if there are `k` sticks of that length, we can form `k // 3` polygons using those sticks (since each polygon needs 3 sticks of the same length).

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the program to see if it correctly implements the above logic:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `w`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Frequencies:**
   - It uses a dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It also maintains a list `pl` of unique stick lengths.

3. **Calculating Maximum Polygons:**
   - For each unique stick length `j` in `pl`, if there are at least 3 sticks of that length (`d[j] >= 3`), it adds `d[j] // 3` to the `shapes` counter.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the total number of polygons `shapes` for each test case.

### Checking the Logic:
- The program correctly counts the number of sticks of each length.
- It correctly calculates the number of polygons that can be formed from sticks of each length.
- The output for each test case is the sum of polygons that can be formed from each unique stick length.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Input:**
```
4
1
1
2
1 1
6
2 2 3 3 3 3
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
```

**Output:**
```
0
0
1
2
```

- **Test Case 1:** Only one stick, cannot form a polygon.
- **Test Case 2:** Two sticks, cannot form a polygon.
- **Test Case 3:** Four sticks of length 3 can form one square.
- **Test Case 4:** Four sticks of length 2 can form one pentagon, and four sticks of length 4 can form one square.

The program correctly produces the expected output for the given example.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks.

**Correctness:** **True**
