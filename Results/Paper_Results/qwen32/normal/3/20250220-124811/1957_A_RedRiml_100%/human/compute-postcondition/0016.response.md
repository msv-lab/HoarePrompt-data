Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has at least 1 integer; `d` is a dictionary where `i` is now a key with the value `1` (overwriting any previous value); `pl` is unchanged if `i` was already in `pl`, or now contains the integer `i` if `i` was not in `pl`; `i` is the next element in `palka`.**

Explanation: The value of `d[i]` is set to `1`, which means if `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is now `1`. The other variables remain unchanged except for the value of `d[i]`.
