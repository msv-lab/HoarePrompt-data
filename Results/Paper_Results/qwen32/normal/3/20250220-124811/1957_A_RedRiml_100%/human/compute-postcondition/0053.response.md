The code snippet `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. This means `pl` will now contain the value of `i` as its last element. The other variables (`t`, `ln`, `palka`, `shapes`, and the dictionary `d`) are not affected by this operation.

Since `pl` was initially an empty list, after the append operation, `pl` will contain exactly one element, which is `i`. The value of `shapes` is dependent on the elements in `pl` and their corresponding values in `d`, but since `pl` is now updated, `shapes` would need to be recalculated if `d[i] >= 3`. However, the problem statement does not require us to calculate the new value of `shapes` explicitly, only to describe the state after the append operation.

Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w - 1`, where `w` is greater than 1; `ln` is the new input integer; `palka` is a new list of integers from the input and must have at least 1 element; `pl` is a list containing the value `i`; `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d` is updated to contain the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, `d.get(i)` is not `None` and the value of `d[i]` is incremented by `1`. The current value of `i` is not in `pl` before the append operation.**
