The code snippet `d[i] = 1` changes the value of the element at index `i` in the list `d` to 1. No other variables are directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is `w - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `pl` is unchanged, `d` is unchanged except `d[i]` is 1, `i` is the next element in `palka`**.

In simpler terms, the value at index `i` in the list `d` has been set to 1. All other variables remain as they were in the initial state.
