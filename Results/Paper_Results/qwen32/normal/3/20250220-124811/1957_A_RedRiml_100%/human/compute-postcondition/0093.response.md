The code snippet `pl.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `pl` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `pl` will contain one element, which is `i`. The other variables (`t`, `shapes`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is `w - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `pl` is a list containing the element `i`, and `d` is a dictionary. The current value of `i` is now in `pl`. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**
