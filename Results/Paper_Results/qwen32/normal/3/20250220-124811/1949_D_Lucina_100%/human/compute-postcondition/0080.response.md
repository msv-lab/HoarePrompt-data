The value of `a[i]` is incremented by 1. The values of `x`, `j`, and `n` are not affected by this operation. The precondition that `j` is `j + 1` and must be less than `n + 1` remains valid.

Output State: **`x` is a string or a list, `j` is `j + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`, `a[i]` is incremented by 1**.
