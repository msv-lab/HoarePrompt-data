The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to `n` and `j` is 1. Therefore, the character at `xx[n][0]` is appended to `nx`.

Output State: **`nx` is a string with `xx[n][0]` appended, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1.**
