Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is 2, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` for any `i` from 1 to `n`, then those indices are appended to `sb`. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is 2, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` for any `i` from 1 to `n`, then those indices are appended to `sb`. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, `j` is 1. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string at position `i` in `xx` is not a '?', then `nx` is `xx[2][0]`. Otherwise, if both `i` and `j` are in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is 2, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` for any `i` from 1 to `n`, then those indices are appended to `sb`. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, `j` is 2. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string at position `i` in `xx` is not a '?', `nx` is the original `nx` with the character at position `j - 1` in the string at position `i` in `xx` appended to it. Otherwise, if both `i` and `j` are in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, `nx` is 'SS'. If `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` but not both, `nx` is `xx[2][0] + 'S'` if the character at position `j - 1` in the string at position `i` in `xx` is not a '?', otherwise `nx` is 'FS'. If neither `i` nor `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, `nx` is its previous value plus 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is 2, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` for any `i` from 1 to `n`, then those indices are appended to `sb`. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, `j` is 3. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string at position `i` in `xx` is not a '?', `nx` is the original `nx` with the character at position `j - 1` in the string at position `i` in `xx` appended to it. If the character at position `j - 1` in the string at position `i` in `xx` is a '?', and if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, `nx` has 'S' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `nx` is its previous value plus 'F'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
