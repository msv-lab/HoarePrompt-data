Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the total number of 'F' characters in `x` and `a[2]` and `a[3]` are the cumulative number of 'F' characters up to positions 2 and 3 in `x`, respectively, with adjustments based on whether `x[j - 1]` is 'F'; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[1]` is the total number of 'S' characters in `x` and `b[2]` and `b[3]` are the cumulative number of 'S' characters up to positions 2 and 3 in `x`, respectively, with `b[2]` and `b[3]` incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` is 'S'; `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the input string `x`; `i` is 2; `x` is the new input string; `j` is 4. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `b[2]` and `b[3]` are incremented by 1.**
