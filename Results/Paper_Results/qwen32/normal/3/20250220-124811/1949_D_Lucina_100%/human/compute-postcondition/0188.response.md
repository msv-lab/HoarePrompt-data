Output State: **`nx` is a string with 'F' appended to its original value, `xx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`, `sa` is a list, `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1.**

In simpler terms, `nx` now has an additional character 'F' at the end, while all other variables remain unchanged.
