Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a symmetric matrix of size `n x n` where each element is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', with '.' only on the diagonal. The function returns a configuration of the matrix where '?' characters are replaced with 'F' or 'S' such that there are at most floor(n/2) pre-decided transition videos ('F' or 'S') in the matrix.**
