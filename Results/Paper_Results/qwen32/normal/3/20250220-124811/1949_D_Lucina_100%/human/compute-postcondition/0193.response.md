The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at index `j - 1` of the string `xx[i]` to the string `nx`. Given that `j` is 2, `j - 1` equals 1. Therefore, the character at index 1 of the string `xx[i]` is appended to `nx`.

Output State: **`nx` is a string with the additional character `xx[i][1]` appended to it; `xx` is a string of length `n` where each character is determined by the corresponding character in `xx[n]`; `sa` is a list; `i` is an integer; `n` is greater than 0; `j` is 2.**
