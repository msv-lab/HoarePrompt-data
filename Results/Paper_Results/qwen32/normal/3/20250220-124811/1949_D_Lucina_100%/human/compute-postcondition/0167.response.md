The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at index `j-1` of the string `xx[i]` to the string `nx`. Given that `i` is equal to `n` and `j` is 2, the character at index `1` (since `j-1` is `1`) of the string `xx[n]` is appended to `nx`.

Since the specific values of `n`, `xx`, and `nx` are not provided, we can only express the updated state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`nx` is a string that has been updated to include the character at index 1 of `xx[n]`; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is equal to `n`; `j` is 2.**
