Output State: **`x` is a string or a list, `j` is an index such that `j` is incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `j + 1`, and `j` must be less than `n + 1`; `b[i]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, this means that the value at index `i` in the list `b` has been increased by 1. The state of `x` and the condition for `j` remain unchanged.
