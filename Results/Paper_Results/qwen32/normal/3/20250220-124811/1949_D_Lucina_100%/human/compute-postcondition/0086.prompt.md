Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where `a[1]` is the total number of 'F' characters in the previous `x` and `a[j]` for `j` from 2 to `n+1` is the cumulative number of 'F' characters up to position `j-1` in the previous `x`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[1]` is the total number of 'S' characters in the previous `x` and `b[j]` for `j` from 2 to `n+1` is the cumulative number of 'S' characters up to position `j-1` in the previous `x`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the previous `x` twice, `i` is 3, and `x` is the new input string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is a string or a list, and `j` is an index such that `j - 1` is a valid index in `x`. If the element at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'F', then `a[i]` and `a[j]` are each incremented by 1. If the element at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `j - 1` in `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then `b[j]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is a string or a list, and `j` is an index such that `j` is incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `j + 1`, and `j` must be less than `n + 1`. If `x[j - 1]` is equal to 'F', the element at index `i` in the list `a` is incremented by 1, and the element at index `j` in the list `a` is incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is equal to 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is a string or a list, `j` is incremented by 1 and remains less than `n + 1`. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then both `b[i]` and `b[j]` are incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
