The code snippet `nx += 'F'` simply appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Therefore, the value of `nx` will be its previous value with 'F' added to the end.

Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged. The only change is to `nx`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and all `n` input strings, `i` is 2, `sa` is a list of indices where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list of indices where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` for any `i` from 1 to `n`, then those indices are appended to `sb`. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, `j` is 3. `nx` is its previous value plus 'F'.**
