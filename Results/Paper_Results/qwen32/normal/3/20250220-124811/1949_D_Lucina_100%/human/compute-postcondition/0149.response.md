The code snippet provided is `nx = ''`, which reassigns the variable `nx` to an empty string. The initial state indicates that `nx` was a string of length `n` constructed by certain conditions, and `i` was `n`. The execution of the code changes the value of `nx` to an empty string, while `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is an empty string, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`.**
