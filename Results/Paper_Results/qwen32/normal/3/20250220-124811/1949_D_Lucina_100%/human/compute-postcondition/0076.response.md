Output State: **`x` is a string or a list, `j` is an index such that `j` is incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `j + 1`, and `j` must be less than `n + 1`; `b[j]` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value at index `j` in the list `b` has been incremented by 1. The value of `j` has also been incremented by 1, but the conditions that `j` must be less than `n + 1` still hold true. The variable `x` remains unchanged.
