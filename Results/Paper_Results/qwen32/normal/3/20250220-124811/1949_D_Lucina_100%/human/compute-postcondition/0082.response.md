The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `b` by 1. The values of `x`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `j` is `j + 1` and must be less than `n + 1` is still valid after the code execution.

Output State: **`x` is a string or a list, `j` is `j + 1` and must be less than `n + 1`, `b[i]` is incremented by 1**.
