The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value.
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The states of `x`, `n`, `output1`, and `output2` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. The value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `output1` is a list containing the integer `i` and `output2` is a list containing the integer `x / i`. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists. `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `output1` is a list containing the integer `i` and `output2` is a list containing the integer `x / i`. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
