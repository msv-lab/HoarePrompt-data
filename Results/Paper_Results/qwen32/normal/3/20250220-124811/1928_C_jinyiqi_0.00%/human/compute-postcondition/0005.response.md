The code appends the result of the integer division of `x` by `i` to the list `output2`. Given that `x` is divisible by `i`, the division `x / i` results in an integer. The values of `x`, `n`, and `output1` remain unchanged. The only change is that `output2` now contains one additional element, which is the integer result of `x / i`.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list containing the integer `i`; `output2` is a list containing the integer `x / i`; `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).**
