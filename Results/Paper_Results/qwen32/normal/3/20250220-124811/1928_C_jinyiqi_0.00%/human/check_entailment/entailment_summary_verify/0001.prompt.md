You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list of all divisors of `x`, arranged such that divisors greater than the square root of `x` appear first, followed by divisors less than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine how many values of `k` fit the given constraints for Vasya's position `n` and number `x`.
   - The sequence of positions is periodic with a period of `2k - 2`.
   - The sequence starts with numbers `1, 2, ..., k`, then `k - 1, k - 2, ..., 2`, and repeats.

2. **Constraints:**
   - `k > 1`
   - `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`
   - We need to find all `k` such that Vasya's position `n` corresponds to the number `x` in the sequence.

3. **Approach:**
   - The sequence can be split into two parts: the increasing part `1, 2, ..., k` and the decreasing part `k - 1, k - 2, ..., 2`.
   - For a given `k`, the position `n` can correspond to `x` in either the increasing or the decreasing part.
   - We need to check both possibilities and count valid `k` values.

4. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - For the increasing part: `n = (i - 1) * (2k - 2) + x` for some integer `i`.
   - For the decreasing part: `n = (i - 1) * (2k - 2) + (2k - x)` for some integer `i`.
   - Rearranging, we get two equations:
     - `n - x = (i - 1) * (2k - 2)`
     - `n - (2k - x) = (i - 1) * (2k - 2)`
   - Both equations imply that `n - x` and `n - (2k - x)` must be divisible by `2k - 2`.
   - We need to find `k` such that these conditions hold and `k >= x`.

5. **Implementation Details:**
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to find divisors of a number.
   - It checks two conditions based on the equations derived above.
   - It ensures that the calculated `k` is at least `x` and is even.

6. **Issues in the Given Program:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return divisors of a number, but the returned list is not correctly used.
   - The program does not correctly calculate or use the divisors to find valid `k` values.
   - The output list is not properly populated or printed.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid `k` values.
   - The logic for checking divisors and calculating `k` is flawed.
