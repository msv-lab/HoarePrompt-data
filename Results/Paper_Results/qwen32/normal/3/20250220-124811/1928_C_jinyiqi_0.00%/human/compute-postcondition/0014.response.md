Postcondition: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so `i` is now `i + 1`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `output1` contains the integer `i` and `output2` contains the integer `x / i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists.**
