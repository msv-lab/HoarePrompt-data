Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate an array `a` such that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. However, the current implementation does not ensure this condition is met. Specifically, the line `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` does not guarantee that `ans[i] % ans[i + 1] = arr[i]`.

A correct approach would be to set `a_1` to a sufficiently large number (e.g., `10^9`) and then set each subsequent `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` because `a_i` is constructed to be exactly `x_i` more than a multiple of `a_{i-1}`.

Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n  # Set a_1 to a large number
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]  # Ensure a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i
    return ans
```

With this correction, the program would output valid arrays `a` for each test case.
