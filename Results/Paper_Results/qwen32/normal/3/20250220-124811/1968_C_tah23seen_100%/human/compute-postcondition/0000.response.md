The code snippet initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, where each element is set to the value `10 ** 9`. This operation does not affect the variables `arr` or `n` directly, but it changes the state of the variable `ans`.

Given the initial state, the variable `arr` is a list of integers, and `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, including the first element `a_1` which is not provided in `arr`. The number of test cases `t` and the constraints on `n` and the sum of all `n` values across all test cases remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and `ans` is a list of `n` integers where each element is `10 ** 9`.**
