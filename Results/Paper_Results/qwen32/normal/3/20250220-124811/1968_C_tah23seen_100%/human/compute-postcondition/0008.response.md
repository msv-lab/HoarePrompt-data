The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `0`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 5`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to a value that is still greater than or equal to `0`.

Since `i` is `n - 5`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `n - 4`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of `n` integers where the first \( n-2 \) elements are `10`, the \( n-3 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2] - arr[n-4]`, the \( n-2 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2]`, and the last element is `10`; `i` is \( n - 4 \)**.
