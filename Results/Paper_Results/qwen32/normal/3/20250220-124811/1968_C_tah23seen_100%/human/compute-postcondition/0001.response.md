The value of `i` is assigned `n - 2`. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where each element is `10`, and `i` is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of `n` integers where each element is `10`, and `i` is `n - 2`.**
