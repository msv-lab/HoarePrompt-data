Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \).
- `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \).
- `ans` is a list of `n` integers where:
  - The first \( n-2 \) elements are `10`.
  - The \( n-3 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2] - arr[n-4]`.
  - The \( n-2 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2]`.
  - The last element is `10`.
- `i` is \( n - 4 \).

The code snippet is:
```
ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
```

The value of `i` is \( n - 4 \), so the element `ans[i]` is the \( n-4 \) element of the list `ans`. The element `ans[i + 1]` is the \( n-3 \) element of the list `ans`, which is `10 - arr[n-2] - arr[n-4]`. The element `arr[i]` is `arr[n-4]`.

Given the code, the \( n-4 \) element of `ans` is updated to:
\[ \text{ans}[i] = \text{ans}[i + 1] - \text{arr}[i] = (10 - \text{arr}[n-2] - \text{arr}[n-4]) - \text{arr}[n-4] = 10 - \text{arr}[n-2] - 2 \times \text{arr}[n-4] \]

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of `n` integers where the first \( n-2 \) elements are `10`, the \( n-3 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2] - arr[n-4]`, the \( n-2 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2]`, the \( n-4 \) element is `10 - arr[n-2] - 2 * arr[n-4]`, and the last element is `10`; `i` is \( n - 4 \)**.
