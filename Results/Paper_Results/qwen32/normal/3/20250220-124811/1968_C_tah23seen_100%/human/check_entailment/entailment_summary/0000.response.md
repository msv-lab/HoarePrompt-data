Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate an array `a` such that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 <= i <= n`. However, the implementation provided in `func_1` does not follow this logic. Instead, it initializes the `ans` array with `10^9` and then tries to adjust the values based on the elements of `arr`, which does not ensure that the modulo condition is met.

The execution summary also misinterprets the function's behavior. The summary suggests that `ans[i]` is calculated as `10 - (sum of elements in `arr` from index `i` to `n-2`)`, which is not what the code actually does. The code simply subtracts `arr[i]` from `ans[i+1]`, which still does not guarantee that the modulo condition is satisfied.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:
1. Set `a_n` to any value greater than or equal to `x_n` (since `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_n`).
2. For `a_{n-1}`, choose a value such that `a_n % a_{n-1} = x_{n-1}`. This can be done by setting `a_{n-1}` to `x_{n-1} + k * a_n` for any integer `k >= 0`. The simplest choice is to set `a_{n-1} = x_{n-1} + a_n`.
3. Repeat the process for `a_{n-2}`, `a_{n-3}`, and so on, ensuring that `a_{i+1} % a_i = x_i`.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[n-1] = arr[n-2] + 1  # Set a_n to any value greater than x_n
    for i in range(n-2, 0, -1):
        ans[i] = arr[i-1] + ans[i+1]  # Ensure a_{i+1} % a_i = x_i
    ans[0] = ans[1] + 1  # Set a_1 to any value greater than a_2
    return ans
```

Given the above analysis, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
