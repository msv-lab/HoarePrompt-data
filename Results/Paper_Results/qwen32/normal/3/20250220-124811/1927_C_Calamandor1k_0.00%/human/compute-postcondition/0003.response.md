The code reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
