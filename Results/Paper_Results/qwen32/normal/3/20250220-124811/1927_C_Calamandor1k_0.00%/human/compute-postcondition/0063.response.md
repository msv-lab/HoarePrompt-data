Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element or `b` must have at least 1 element; `b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element or `a` must have at least 1 element; `len_a` is the length of the new list `a`; `len_b` is the length of the new list `b`; `i` is `i + 1`. If `len_a` > `i + 1` and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is incremented by 1.**
