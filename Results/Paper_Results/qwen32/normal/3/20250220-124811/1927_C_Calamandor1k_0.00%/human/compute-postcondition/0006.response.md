The code snippet initializes two variables, `count_a` and `count_b`, to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, and `len_b`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `len_a` is the length of list `a`; `len_b` is the length of list `b`; `count_a` is 0; `count_b` is 0.**
