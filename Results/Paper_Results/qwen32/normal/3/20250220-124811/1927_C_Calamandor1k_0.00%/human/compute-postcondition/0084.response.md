Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input with `len_a` greater than 0; `b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input with `len_b` being a positive integer; `d` is `k // 2`; `i` is 0. The condition `len_b > i + 1` is true, indicating that `len_b` is greater than 1. `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`. If `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, `count_a` is set to 1 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_a` is set to 0. `count_b` is 1.**
