The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This affects the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, `len_b`, `count_a`, `count_b`, and `d`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 10^4 - 1\); `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `len_a` is the length of the new list `a`; `len_b` is the length of the new list `b`; `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `d` is `k // 2`.**
