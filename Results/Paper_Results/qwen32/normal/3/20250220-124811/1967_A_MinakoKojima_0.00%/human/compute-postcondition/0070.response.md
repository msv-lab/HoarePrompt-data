To determine the output state, we need to carefully analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```
a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
```

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0
- `i` is 4

The code modifies the array `a` at index `i` (which is 4). The new value of `a[4]` is determined by the expression `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[4])`.

Let's break down the expression:
- `m` is some integer value.
- `k` is some integer value.
- `n` is already defined and greater than 0.
- `a[4]` is the current value at index 4 of the array `a`.

The new value of `a[4]` will be:
- `m + k` if `k` is less than or equal to `m + k // n - a[4]`
- `m + m + k // n - a[4]` if `k` is greater than `m + k // n - a[4]`

Since we do not have specific values for `m`, `k`, and `a[4]`, we cannot simplify the expression further. However, we can express the final value of `a[4]` in terms of these variables.

The output state, therefore, will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99
- `n` remains the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0
- `i` remains 4
- `a[4]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[4])`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `i` is 4; `a[4]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[4])`**
