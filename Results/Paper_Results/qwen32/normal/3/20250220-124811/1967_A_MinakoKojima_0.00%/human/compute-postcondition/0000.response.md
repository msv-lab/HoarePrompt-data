In the provided for loop, the loop head contains only the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which is the number of iterations (`t`) in this context. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value that makes the loop execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. The value of `t` must be an integer such that `1 <= t <= 100` for the loop to execute at least once.
3. The variables `n`, `k`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing. They will be used within the loop body, which is not provided in this case.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted so that `int(input())` returns a value within the valid range for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100**
