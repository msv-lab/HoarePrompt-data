The value of `ans` is updated to the factorial of `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged. The Output State is described as follows: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is the factorial of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is the factorial of `n`.**
