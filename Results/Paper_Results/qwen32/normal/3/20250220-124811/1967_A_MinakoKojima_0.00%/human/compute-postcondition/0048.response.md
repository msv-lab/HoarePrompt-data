Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is 1; `k` is the remaining value after all iterations; `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `m` is the minimum value in the updated list `a`; `ans` is `a[0] * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`**

Natural language explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be the product of its previous value (`a[0]`) and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
