The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so we need to increment `i` by 1 again for the next iteration. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the total number of iterations the loop should perform.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, and `n` is the upper limit of the loop, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, for clarity, if we assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `i` is `x + 1`**.

Since we need a concrete state, let's assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration as an example:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `i` is 4**.

But generally, without the exact value of `i`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1**.

For the sake of providing a concrete example, we will assume `i` was 3:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `i` is 4**.
