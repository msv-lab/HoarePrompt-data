Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input. If `k` >= `n * m`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `k` is reduced to 0 or a value less than the minimum possible reduction in each iteration, `a` is the list after all updates, `m` is the minimum value in the final updated list `a`, and `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the product of `(a[i] - a[i-1])` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.**
