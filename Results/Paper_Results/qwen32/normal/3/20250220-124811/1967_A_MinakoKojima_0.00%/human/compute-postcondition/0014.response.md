Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` from it. The value of `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `ans`, and `i` remain as described in the initial state, with `i` incremented by 1.
