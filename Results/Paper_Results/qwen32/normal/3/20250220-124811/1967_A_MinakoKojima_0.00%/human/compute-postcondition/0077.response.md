Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced to 0 or a value less than the minimum possible reduction in each iteration, `a` is the list after all updates, `m` is the minimum value in the final updated list `a`, `ans` is the first element of the list `a` multiplied by the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `a` for all `i` up to the current value, `i` is 2**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with the difference between the 2nd element and the 1st element of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
