Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` has been explicitly set to 0 by the code snippet. All other variables retain their initial values as they have not been modified by the code.
