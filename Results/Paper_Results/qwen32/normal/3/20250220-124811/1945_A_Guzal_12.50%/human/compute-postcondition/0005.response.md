Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- Each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input.
- `k` is 0.
- `b` is not divisible by 3.
- `c` is less than 3.
- The sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print(-1)
```

The print statement in the code snippet simply outputs the integer `-1`. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because it is a constant value.

**Output:**
Output: **-1**
