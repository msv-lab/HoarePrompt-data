Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 2`; `k` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `k` has been assigned the value 0. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `i` has been incremented by 2, as specified in the initial state description.
