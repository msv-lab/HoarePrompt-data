The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the specific value of `i` before the increment is not provided, so we can only state that it is now `i + 1`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`.**
