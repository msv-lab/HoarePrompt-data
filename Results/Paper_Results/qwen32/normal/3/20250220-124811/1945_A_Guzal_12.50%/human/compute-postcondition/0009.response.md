The value of `k` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` becomes `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and the condition `(b + c) % 3` are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`; `(b + c) % 3` is not equal to 0.**
