The given code snippet only initializes the variable `k` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `i`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State remains the same except for the newly introduced variable `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`; `k` is 0.**
