The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This means the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following `t` lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 2`**.

In simpler terms, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers read from the input, while `t`, `n`, and `i` retain their previous values.
