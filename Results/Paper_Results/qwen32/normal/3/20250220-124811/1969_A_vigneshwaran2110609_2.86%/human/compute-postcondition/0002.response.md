The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `x`. This means `x` will take on the integer value provided by the user input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `x` is an input integer.**
