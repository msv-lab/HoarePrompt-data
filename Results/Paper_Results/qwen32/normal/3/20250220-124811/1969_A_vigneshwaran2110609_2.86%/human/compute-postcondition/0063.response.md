Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. Each integer `p_i` in the list `p` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i is not equal to i. The function returns the number of test cases where it is possible to rearrange the list `p` such that for each index i, p_i is not equal to i.**
