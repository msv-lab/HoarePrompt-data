The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, and p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `x` is the new input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is equal to the new x + 1. The loop prints 3.**
