Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n, and p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `x` is greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2. If `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `flag` or the flow of the program.**
