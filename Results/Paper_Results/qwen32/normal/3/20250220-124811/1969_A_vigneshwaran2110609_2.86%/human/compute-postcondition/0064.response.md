Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it prints `2` if it is possible to rearrange the list `p` such that for each index `i`, `p_i` is not equal to `i` after a certain number of operations, otherwise it prints `3`. The function does not return a value; it only outputs the results for each test case.**
