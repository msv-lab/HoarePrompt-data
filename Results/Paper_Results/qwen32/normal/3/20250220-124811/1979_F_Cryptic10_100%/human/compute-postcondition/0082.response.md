The code snippet `vx.remove(v1)` removes the element `v1` from the set `vx`. Given that `vx` is a set of integers with at least 3 elements, after removing `v1`, `vx` will still be a set but with one less element. The values of `t`, `ops`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 2 elements (after removing `v1`), `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`, and `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`.**
