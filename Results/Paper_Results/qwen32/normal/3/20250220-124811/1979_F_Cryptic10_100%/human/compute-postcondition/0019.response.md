The code snippet appends two tuples to the list `ops`. The first tuple contains the value of `v3` and `0`, and the second tuple contains the value of `v1` and `0`. No other variables are modified directly by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, `t` remains an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 2 elements (after removing `v1` and `v3`), and `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` retain their specified values. The only change is that `ops` now includes the two new tuples.

Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 2 elements (after removing `v1` and `v3`), `ops` is a list with two additional elements `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `v1` is `q(len(vx) - 2)[0]`, `v2` is `q(len(vx) - 2)[1]`, `v3` is the first element of the tuple returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.**
