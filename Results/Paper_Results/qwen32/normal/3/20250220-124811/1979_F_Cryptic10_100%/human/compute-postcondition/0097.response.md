Postcondition: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000. If `v2` is greater than 0, `vx` is a set of integers with exactly 2 elements after removing `v1`, `ops` contains an additional tuple `(v1, v2)`, `p1` includes the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`, and `p2` includes any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` is a set of integers with exactly 1 element after removing `v3`, `ops` contains `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `p1` includes the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` includes any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`, and `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`.**
