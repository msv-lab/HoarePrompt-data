The code snippet provided appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The other variables `t`, `vx`, `p1`, and `p2` are not modified by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000.
- `vx` is a set of integers with exactly 2 elements after removing `v1`.
- `ops` is a list that contains one tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, or `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0.
- `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`.
- `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`.

After executing the code snippet `ops += [(v1, v2)]`, the list `ops` will now contain the additional tuple `(v1, v2)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000; `vx` is a set of integers with exactly 2 elements after removing `v1`; `ops` is a list that contains one tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, or `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, plus the additional tuple `(v1, v2)`; `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`; `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`.**
