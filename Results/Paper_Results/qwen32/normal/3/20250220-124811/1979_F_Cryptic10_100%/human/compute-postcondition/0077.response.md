Let's break down the given code and initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000.
- `vx` is a set containing 2 or fewer integers.
- `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed.
- `p1` is a list that initially contains the elements of `vx` and may have additional `v1` values appended when the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`.
- `p2` is a list that contains `v1` values appended when the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`.

### Code Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)
```

1. **`p1[::-1]`**: This reverses the list `p1`.
2. **`p1[::-1] + p2`**: This concatenates the reversed `p1` with `p2`.
3. **`map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)`**: This converts each element of the concatenated list to a string.
4. **`' '.join(...)`**: This joins all the string elements with a space.
5. **`'! %s' % ...`**: This formats the string to start with an exclamation mark followed by the joined string.

### Output Explanation:
- The output will start with an exclamation mark (`!`).
- After the exclamation mark, the elements of `p1` in reverse order will be printed, followed by the elements of `p2`, all separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the code, the output will be a formatted string starting with `!`, followed by the elements of `p1` in reverse order and then the elements of `p2`, separated by spaces.

Output: **! [elements of p1 in reverse order] [elements of p2] (where p1 is the list containing initial elements of vx plus any v1 values appended when p1[-1] != v2, and p2 is the list containing any v1 values appended when p1[-1] == v2)**
