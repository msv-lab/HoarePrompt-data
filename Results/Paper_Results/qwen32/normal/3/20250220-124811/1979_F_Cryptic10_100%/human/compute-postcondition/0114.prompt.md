Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with 2 or fewer elements, `ops` is a list of tuples representing all the operations performed, `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx`, `p2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with 2 or fewer elements, `ops` is a list of tuples representing all the operations performed and must contain at least one tuple, if `p1[-1] == v2` then `p2` contains `v1` as its last element and `p1` remains unchanged, otherwise `p1` contains `v1` as its last element and `p2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with 2 or fewer elements, `ops` is a list of tuples representing all the operations performed and must contain at least one tuple, `(v1, v2)` is the tuple before the last processed tuple `(v1_prev, v2_prev)` in the `ops` list, and either `v1` is appended to `p2` if `p1[-1] == v2`, or `v1` is appended to `p1` if `p1[-1] != v2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with 2 or fewer elements, `ops` is a list of tuples with the last tuple modified or a new tuple appended based on the condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
