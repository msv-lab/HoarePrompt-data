The code snippet `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)` appends `v1` to either `p1` or `p2` depending on whether the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`.

- If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`.
- Otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`.

Given the initial state, `p1` contains the initial elements of `vx`, and `p2` is initially empty.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:
1. If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` will now contain `v1` as its first element, and `p1` will remain unchanged.
2. If `p1[-1] != v2`, then `p1` will have `v1` appended to it, and `p2` will remain unchanged.

Since the exact values of `v1` and `v2` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact elements of `p1` or `p2` after the operation. However, we can describe the state based on the conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with 2 or fewer elements, `ops` is a list of tuples representing all the operations performed and must contain at least one tuple, if `p1[-1] == v2` then `p2` contains `v1` as its last element and `p1` remains unchanged, otherwise `p1` contains `v1` as its last element and `p2` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, `v1` is added to `p2`; otherwise, `v1` is added to `p1`.
