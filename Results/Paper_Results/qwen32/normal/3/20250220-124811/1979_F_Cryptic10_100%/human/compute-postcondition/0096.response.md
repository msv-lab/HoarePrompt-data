The code snippet provided appends two tuples to the list `ops`. The first tuple added is `(v3, 0)`, and the second tuple is `(v1, 0)`. This means that the list `ops` will now include these two additional elements at the end.

Given the initial state, the variable `ops` is initially described as:
- Containing one tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0.
- Or containing `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0.

After the code snippet executes, the list `ops` will have these additional tuples added to it. The other variables (`t`, `vx`, `p1`, `p2`, and `v3`) are not modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with exactly 1 element after removing `v3`, `ops` is a list that contains its original elements plus `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`, `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`**.
