In the provided loop, the only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a conventional placeholder for a variable that we do not intend to use. The loop iterates `int(input())` times, which means the number of iterations is determined by the integer `t` read from the standard input.

Given this, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value `t`. Since `t` is read from the standard input, we need to ensure that the input is provided in the correct format before the loop starts.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop will execute `int(input())` times.
2. The value of `t` (the number of test cases) must be provided as the first input.
3. The loop will not execute if `t` is less than 1, as the range function will generate an empty sequence.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1 and no greater than 1000 as per the problem constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, representing the number of test cases**
