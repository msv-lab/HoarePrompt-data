To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how the iteration progresses. The loop iterates over the list `ops` in reverse order using `ops[::-1]`, and in each iteration, the loop variables `v1` and `v2` are updated to the next pair from this reversed list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state of `v1`, `v2`, and `ops` for the next iteration. Since the loop iterates over `ops` in reverse, the next iteration will involve the previous pair in the list.

Let's break this down:

- **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `v1` and `v2` are the last pair from `ops[::-1]`.
- **Next State**: For the next iteration, `v1` and `v2` need to be updated to the next pair in the reversed list `ops[::-1]`.

Since the loop iterates in reverse, the next pair `(v1, v2)` will be the pair before the current one in the reversed list. This means we need to move one step back in the reversed list.

Let's assume the current pair is `ops[i]` in the original list `ops`. Since we are iterating in reverse, the current pair is actually `ops[-(i+1)]` in the original list. The next pair in the reversed list would be `ops[-(i+2)]` in the original list.

Therefore, to get the next pair `(v1, v2)` for the next iteration, we need to consider the pair before the current one in the reversed list.

**Answer**:
State: **`v1` and `v2` are the next pair in the reversed list `ops[::-1]`, and `ops` remains unchanged.**

If we denote the current pair as `ops[-(i+1)]`, then the next pair will be `ops[-(i+2)]`. However, without knowing the exact current index `i`, we can only say that `v1` and `v2` are the next pair in the reversed list.

State: **`v1` and `v2` are the next pair in the reversed list `ops[::-1]`**
