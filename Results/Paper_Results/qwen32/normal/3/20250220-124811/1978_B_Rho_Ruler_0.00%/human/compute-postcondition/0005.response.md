Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` with the constraints 0 <= k <= min(n, b) and 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. It calculates a value based on these parameters and returns True if the calculated value is less than or equal to `n` times the maximum of `a` and `b`.**
