The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into multiple string values, converts each of these string values to an integer, and then stores them in a list named `l`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` is not initialized in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `i` is not yet initialized, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
