Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `i` is not yet initialized; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the list `l`; `m` is the length of the list `l`. If 1 is in the list `l`, then `e` includes the integer 1 and `m` is at least 1. Otherwise, 1 is not in the list `l`.**
