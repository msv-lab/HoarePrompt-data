The code snippet `e = set(l)` updates the set `e` to contain the unique elements from the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `i` is 2; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the list `l`; `m` is the length of the list `l`.**
