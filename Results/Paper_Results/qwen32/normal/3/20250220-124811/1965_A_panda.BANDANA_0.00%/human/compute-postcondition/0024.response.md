The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `l`, `e`, `m`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases.
2. The variable `n` is an input integer.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 2.
4. The variable `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
5. The variable `e` is a set of unique integers from the list `l`.
6. The variable `m` is the length of the list `l`.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Bob'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Bob**
