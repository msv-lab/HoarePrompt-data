You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even. The following two lines for each test case contain strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

            else:

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is equal to `t-1` (indicating all iterations have completed), `n` is the integer from the last test case, `a` is the string from the last test case, and `b` is the string from the last test case. The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). There are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the First Row**: The code incorrectly assumes that if the second last character in the second row is not '>', the robot cannot reach the destination. This is not necessarily true, as the robot can still reach the destination if it can navigate properly through the grid.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Single Column Case**: The code incorrectly prints 'YES' for a single column case, which is not possible since `n` is always even and at least 2.

3. **Incorrect Loop Conditions**: The loops in the code do not correctly handle the conditions for checking the paths. The code checks for '>' in the second row at even indices and in the first row at odd indices, but it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and arrow following.

4. **Inefficient and Incorrect Path Checking**: The code does not simulate the robot's movement step-by-step according to the problem description. It does not handle the possibility of the robot moving left, right, down, or up and then following the arrow in the current cell.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

In this case, the robot can start at (1, 1), move to (1, 2), follow the arrow to (2, 2), move to (2, 1), follow the arrow to (1, 1), move to (1, 2), follow the arrow to (2, 2), move to (2, 3), follow the arrow to (1, 3), move to (1, 4), follow the arrow to (2, 4), and reach the destination (2, 4).

To correctly solve the problem, the code should simulate the robot's movement step-by-step according to the problem description.
