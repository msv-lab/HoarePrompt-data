You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even. The following two lines for each test case contain strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is equal to `t-1` (indicating all iterations have completed), `n` is the integer from the last test case, `a` is the string from the last test case, and `b` is the string from the last test case. The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of a grid. The function returns the minimum number of arrow reversals required to make the grid valid, where a valid grid has no two arrows pointing towards each other in the same column.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
