The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides several variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`) and their conditions, but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be exactly the string `'NO'` as specified.

Let's break down the information given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` and `b` are input strings.
- The second last character of `b` is not '>'.

None of these variables affect the `print('NO')` statement since they are not referenced within it. Thus, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
