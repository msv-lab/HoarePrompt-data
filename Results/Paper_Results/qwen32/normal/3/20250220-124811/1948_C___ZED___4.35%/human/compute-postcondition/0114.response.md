The given initial state describes several variables and conditions, but the specific value of `k` is explicitly stated as 3. The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`.

Let's break down the relevant information:
- `k` is explicitly given as 3.

Since `k` is directly provided, there's no need to derive or calculate its value from any formula or condition.

Therefore, the `print(k)` statement will simply output the value of `k`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
