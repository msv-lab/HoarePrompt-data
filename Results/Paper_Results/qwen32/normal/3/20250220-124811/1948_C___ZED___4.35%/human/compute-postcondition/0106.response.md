Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string, and `no_path` is False. At least one character at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest even index less than `n` in `b` is not `'>'`. The program has entered the if condition because `no_path` is False.**
