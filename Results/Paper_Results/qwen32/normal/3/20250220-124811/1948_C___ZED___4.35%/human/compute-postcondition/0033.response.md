The only variables in the loop head are `k`, `n`, and the range parameters. According to the loop statement, `k` starts at 1 and increments by 2 until it reaches `n - 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `k` should be incremented by 2 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 3. To execute the next iteration, `k` should be 5 (since it increments by 2 each time). The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, and the second-to-last character of `b` is '>'. `k` is 5. If `a[k]` is not equal to '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.**
