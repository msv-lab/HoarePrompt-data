Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 6, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string, and `no_path` is False. At least one character at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest even index less than `n` in `b` is not `'>'`. Additionally, the current value of `a[k]` is not `'>'`. `k` is 5.**

Since the `if` condition `a[k] != '>'` is always true according to the precondition (the current value of `a[k]` is not `'>'`), the `else` part does not execute. Therefore, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
