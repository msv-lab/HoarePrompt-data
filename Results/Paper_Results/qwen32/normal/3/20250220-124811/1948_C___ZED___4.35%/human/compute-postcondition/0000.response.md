In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `i` and the range determined by `t`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` and ensure that `t` is set correctly for the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly defined in the provided state. However, for the loop to start executing, `i` should be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 0.

2. **Variable `t`**: The variable `t` is already described as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` is already in a valid state for the loop to execute, as long as it falls within the specified range.

3. **Other Variables**: The variables `n`, the two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>', and the sum of `n` over all test cases are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Given this, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0, and `t` is within the valid range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0**
