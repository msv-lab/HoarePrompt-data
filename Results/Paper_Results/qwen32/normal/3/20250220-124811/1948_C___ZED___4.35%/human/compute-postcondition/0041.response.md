Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string with the second-to-last character '>', `k` is the largest odd number less than or equal to `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-3` if `n` is odd. `no_path` is `False`, indicating that at least one character `a[k]` in the specified range was not equal to `'>'`.**
