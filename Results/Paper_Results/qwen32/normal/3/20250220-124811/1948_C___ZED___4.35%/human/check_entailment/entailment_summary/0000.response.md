### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to determine whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a 2-row grid, given the movement rules and the arrows in each cell. However, the logic in the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem described.

Let's break down the problem and the program's logic:

1. **Initial Setup**: The robot starts at (1, 1). It can move in four directions: left, right, up, down, and then it must follow the arrow in the cell it ends up in.

2. **Movement Rules**:
   - The robot can move to an adjacent cell and then follow the arrow in that cell.
   - The robot must reach (2, n).

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the two strings representing the arrows in the grid.
   - It checks if the second last character of the second row is '>', which is a necessary condition for the robot to potentially reach (2, n).
   - If `n` is 1, it prints 'YES', which is incorrect because the problem states `2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`.
   - It then checks if all the even-indexed cells in the second row are '>', and if all the odd-indexed cells (except the last one) in the first row are '>'.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is flawed because:
- It does not properly simulate the robot's movement according to the rules.
- It does not correctly handle the conditions under which the robot can reach (2, n).
- The program does not consider all possible paths the robot can take.

For example, in the third test case:
```
4
>>><
>><<
```
The program would incorrectly print 'NO' because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement. The correct path would be (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4), which is a valid path.
