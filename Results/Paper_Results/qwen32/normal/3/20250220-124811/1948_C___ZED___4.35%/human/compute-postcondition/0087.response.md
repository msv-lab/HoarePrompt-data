Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are strings. If the second last character of `b` is not '>', no further changes occur. If the second last character of `b` is '>' and `n` is 1, no further changes occur. If the second last character of `b` is '>' and `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the largest odd number less than or equal to `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-3` if `n` is odd. If `no_path` is `True`, either all characters `a[k]` in the specified range were equal to `'>'` (when `n` is 1) or at least one character `a[k]` in the specified range was not equal to `'>'` (when `n` is greater than 1). If `no_path` is `False`, at least one character `a[k]` in the specified range was not equal to `'>'`.**
