Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, and `no_path` is `True`. At least one character at even indices in `b` is not `'>'`. Additionally, the current character `a[k]` is not `'>'`.**
