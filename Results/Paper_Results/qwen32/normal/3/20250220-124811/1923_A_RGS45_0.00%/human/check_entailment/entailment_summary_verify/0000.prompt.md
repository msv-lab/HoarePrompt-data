You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters (each character is either '0' or '1'). For each test case, it calculates the number of '0's between the first and last occurrence of '1' in the string and prints this count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. Let's analyze why:

The current implementation attempts to find the first and last positions of chips and then counts the free cells between them, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The problem requires moving chips to the closest free cell to the left, and the minimum operations need to be counted accordingly.

Here’s a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 0 0 1 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Move the chip at position 4 to position 2 (1 operation).
- Move the chip at position 4 (originally at position 4, now at position 2) to position 1 (1 operation).

**Actual Output of Provided Code:**
```
2
```
While the output is correct for this specific input, the approach is flawed. The code counts the free cells between the first and last chip, but it does not correctly account for the minimum operations required to move the chips.

**Another Counterexample:**
**Input:**
```
1
6
1 0 1 0 0 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Move the chip at position 3 to position 2 (1 operation).
- Move the chip at position 1 to position 3 (1 operation).

**Actual Output of Provided Code:**
```
3
```
The code incorrectly counts the free cells between the first and last chip, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all cases correctly. A correct approach would involve iterating through the list and calculating the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together into a contiguous block.
