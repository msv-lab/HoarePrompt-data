Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` < 1000, `n` is the new input integer, `arr` is the new string input provided by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is `arr[x:n - y]` if `x` is not -1, otherwise `z` is an empty string.**

In simpler terms: The value of `z` is updated to be the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` up to index `n - y` (not inclusive). If `x` is -1, `z` remains an empty string. All other variables retain their previous values.
