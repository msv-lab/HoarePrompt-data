The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` should be decremented by 1 from its current value.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `x` is at least 2; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`; if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is set to `y`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged; `y` is decremented by 1.

Since `y` is decremented by 1 at the end of the iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `y` will be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`x` is at least 2; `y` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
