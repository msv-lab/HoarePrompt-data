The code assigns `current_sum` the value of `gcd_val + y`. Given that `y` is `y - 2`, `current_sum` becomes `gcd_val + (y - 2)`. The other variables (`results`, `test_cases`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and conditions.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `y` is `y - 2`, `gcd_val` is the GCD of `x` and `y - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (y - 2)`**.
