Postcondition: **`x` is at least 2; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum` and `best_y` is set to `y`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**
