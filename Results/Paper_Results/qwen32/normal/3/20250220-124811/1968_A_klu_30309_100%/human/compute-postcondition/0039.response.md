The only variable in the loop head is `y`. According to the loop statement `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1)`, `y` starts from `x - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was used to compute `gcd_val` and `current_sum`. To execute the loop one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that `y` is currently the second element in the iteration sequence, the next value of `y` should be `y - 1`.

State: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000), `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000), `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element in `test_cases`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to the current `y`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged, `y` is `y - 1`**
