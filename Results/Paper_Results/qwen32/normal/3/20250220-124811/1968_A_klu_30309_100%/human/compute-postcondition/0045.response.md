Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000); `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000); `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`; `x` is the second element in `test_cases`; `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`; `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`; `y` is `y - 1`.**
