Output State: **`x` is at least 2; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y` and the current value of `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`; `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`.**

In natural language, after the execution of the code, `max_sum` is updated to be equal to `current_sum`. All other conditions and variable relationships remain the same.
