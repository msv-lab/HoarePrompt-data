Output State: **`x` is at least 2; `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`; `max_sum` is `current_sum`; `best_y` is set to `y` if `current_sum` is greater than the previous `max_sum`, otherwise `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged; `y` is decremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The value of `max_sum` is updated to the value of `current_sum`. If `current_sum` was greater than the previous `max_sum`, `best_y` is also updated to the current value of `y`. The values of `x`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, and `y` (after being decremented) remain as they were, or are updated as specified.
