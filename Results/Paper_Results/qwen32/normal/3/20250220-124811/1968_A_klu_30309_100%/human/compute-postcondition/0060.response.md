Output State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

Explanation: The value of `current_sum` is updated to be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. All other variables retain their initial values.
