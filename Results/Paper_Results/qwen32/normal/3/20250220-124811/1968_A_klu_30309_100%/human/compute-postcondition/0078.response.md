Output State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `y` is `y - 2`, `gcd_val` is the GCD of `x` and `y - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (y - 2)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (y - 2)`, `best_y` is `y` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `results`, `test_cases`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, and `best_y` remain as they were before the `break` statement. The only change is that the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
