Output State: **`t` remains unchanged (1 <= t <= 1000); `test_cases` remains unchanged (list of integers with at least two integers x where 2 <= x <= 1000); `results` contains the `best_y` for the first `x` in `test_cases`; `x` is the second element in `test_cases`; `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, y)`; `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y`; `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`; `best_y` remains unchanged unless `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`; `y` is `y - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `max_sum` has been updated to the value of `current_sum`. All other variables remain unchanged unless `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, in which case `best_y` would also be updated (though this condition is not explicitly addressed in the provided code snippet).
