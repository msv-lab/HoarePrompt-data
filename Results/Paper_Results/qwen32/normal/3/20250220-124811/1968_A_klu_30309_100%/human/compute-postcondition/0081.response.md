The code appends `best_y` to the `results` list. Given that `best_y` is 1, it will be added to the `results` list. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the `results` list will now have `best_y` appended to it twice.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it twice, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1.**
