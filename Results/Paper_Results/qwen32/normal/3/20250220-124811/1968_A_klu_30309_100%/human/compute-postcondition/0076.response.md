Output State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `y` is `y - 2`, `gcd_val` is the GCD of `x` and `y - 2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (y - 2)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (y - 2)`**

In this output state, the variable `max_sum` has been assigned the value of `current_sum`, which is `gcd_val + (y - 2)`. All other variables retain their previously stated properties and values.
