Output State: **`results` is a list with `best_y` appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `x` must be at least 1, `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 1`.**

In simple terms, the output state is: `results` remains the same list with `best_y` appended, `test_cases` still has at least one more element, `x` is unchanged and must be at least 1, `y` is now `y - 1`, and a new variable `gcd_val` is introduced with the value of the greatest common divisor of `x` and the updated `y` (which is `y - 1`).
