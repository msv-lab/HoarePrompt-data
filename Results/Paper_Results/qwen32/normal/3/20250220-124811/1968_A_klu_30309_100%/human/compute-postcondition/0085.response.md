Functionality: **The function takes an integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases` as input. It returns a list `results` where each element is the `best_y` value for the corresponding `x` in `test_cases`. The `best_y` is determined by finding the integer `y` (1 <= y < x) that maximizes the sum of `y` and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`.**
