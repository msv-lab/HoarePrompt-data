The only variable in the loop head is `char`, which iterates over each character in the `encoded` string. To ensure that the loop can execute, the `encoded` string must have at least one character. The variables `mapping` and `decoded` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `encoded` is a string with at least one character. The initial values of `mapping` and `decoded` are fine as they do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list**
