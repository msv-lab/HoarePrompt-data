The code assigns the value of `char` to the key `'b'` in the `mapping` dictionary. The values of `encoded`, `decoded`, `char`, and `c` remain unchanged. The `mapping` dictionary is updated to include `'b'` as a key with the value `char`.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `mapping` is a dictionary with `'b'` as a key and `char` as its value; `decoded` remains an empty list; `char` remains the same; `c` is `ord('b')`.**
