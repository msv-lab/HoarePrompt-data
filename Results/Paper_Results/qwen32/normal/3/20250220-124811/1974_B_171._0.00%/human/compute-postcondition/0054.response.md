Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `mapping` includes the key-value pair `'c': char` if `chr(c)` was not in `mapping.values()`, and any other previous mappings; `decoded` includes the appropriate elements based on the mapping rules; `char` is the next character in the `encoded` string; `c` is 99. If `chr(c)` was not in `mapping.values()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
