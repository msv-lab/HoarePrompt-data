The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. This means `c` will take on integer values from 97 (which is `ord('a')`) to 122 (which is `ord('z')`).

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` would have taken on a specific integer value within this range. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be incremented by 1 and still be within the range.

Let's consider the state at the end of the previous iteration. Suppose `c` was 97 (which corresponds to 'a'). At the start of the next iteration, `c` should be 98 (which corresponds to 'b'). The loop will continue as long as `c` is less than or equal to 122.

Given the provided state and the loop, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the incremented value of `c`.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is `'a'` and the value is `char`, and an additional key-value pair where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)` since `chr(c)` was not in `mapping`. If `chr(c)` is already in the values of `mapping`, no changes are made to `mapping` and `decoded` remains unchanged. `char` is the next character in `encoded`. `c` is the next integer in the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z')`**.

To be more specific, if `c` was 97 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `c` should be 98.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is `'a'` and the value is `char`, and an additional key-value pair where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)` since `chr(c)` was not in `mapping`. If `chr(c)` is already in the values of `mapping`, no changes are made to `mapping` and `decoded` remains unchanged. `char` is the next character in `encoded`. `c` is 98**.

If `c` was a different value, say 100 (which corresponds to 'd'), then at the start of the next iteration, `c` should be 101 (which corresponds to 'e').

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is `'a'` and the value is `char`, and an additional key-value pair where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)` since `chr(c)` was not in `mapping`. If `chr(c)` is already in the values of `mapping`, no changes are made to `mapping` and `decoded` remains unchanged. `char` is the next character in `encoded`. `c` is 101**.

In general, if `c` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `c` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is `'a'` and the value is `char`, and an additional key-value pair where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)` since `chr(c)` was not in `mapping`. If `chr(c)` is already in the values of `mapping`, no changes are made to `mapping` and `decoded` remains unchanged. `char` is the next character in `encoded`. `c` is `c + 1`**.

Since we do not know the exact value of `c` from the previous iteration, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is `'a'` and the value is `char`, and an additional key-value pair where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)` since `chr(c)` was not in `mapping`. If `chr(c)` is already in the values of `mapping`, no changes are made to `mapping` and `decoded` remains unchanged. `char` is the next character in `encoded`. `c` is the next integer in the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z')`**. 

To make it more concrete, if `c` was 97 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, `mapping` is updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is `'a'` and the value is `char`, and an additional key-value pair where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`. `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)` since `chr(c)` was not in `mapping`.
