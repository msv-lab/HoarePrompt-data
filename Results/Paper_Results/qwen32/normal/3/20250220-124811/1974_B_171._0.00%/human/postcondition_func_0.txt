The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string. Each unique character in the `encoded` string is mapped to a unique lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z', and the function replaces each character in `encoded` with its corresponding mapped value to produce the decoded string.
