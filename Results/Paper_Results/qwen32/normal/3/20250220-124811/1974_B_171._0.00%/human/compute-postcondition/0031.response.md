The `break` statement will terminate the loop or the block of code it is in, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `mapping` includes a key-value pair where the key is `'b'` and the value is `char`; `decoded` is a list containing the value `chr(c)` since `chr(c)` was not in `mapping` initially; `char` is the next character in `encoded`; `c` is 98.**
