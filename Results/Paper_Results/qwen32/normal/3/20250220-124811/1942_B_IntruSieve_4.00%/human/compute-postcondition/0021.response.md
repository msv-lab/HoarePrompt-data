The code snippet provided is `minn = maxx + 1`. This line updates the value of `minn` to be one more than the value of `maxx`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is to `minn`, which is now `maxx + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is the current index + 1; `mex` includes `minn` as its new last element; `minn` is `maxx + 1`.**
