The only object in the loop head is the variable `itm`, which iterates over each element in the list `mex`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `mex`. If there are more elements in `mex`, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `itm` held the last element of `mex`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `mex` to assign to `itm`. However, since the loop is currently at the end of `mex`, there are no more elements to iterate over. Therefore, the loop cannot execute one more time with the given state.

Since the task specifies to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and there are no more elements to assign to `itm`, the state remains the same.

State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers where `n` must be greater than 0, `minn` is the next smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`, and `maxx` is the maximum value in `mex`**
