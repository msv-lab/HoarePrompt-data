Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is a list containing the single element 0, and if `minn` equals `maxx`, then `minn` is set to `maxx` + 1. Otherwise, if `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` is a list containing the value `-arr[i]`, `minn` is set to 0, and `maxx` is set to `-arr[i]` if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`; otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.**
