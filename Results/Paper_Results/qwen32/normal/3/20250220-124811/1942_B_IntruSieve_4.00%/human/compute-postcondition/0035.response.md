Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is the current index. If `arr[i]` > 0, `mex` contains the previous elements of `mex` plus `minn`. If `minn` was equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is now `maxx + 1`. Otherwise, `minn` remains unchanged. If `arr[i]` is not greater than 0, `mex` now includes an additional element equal to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. Otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.**
