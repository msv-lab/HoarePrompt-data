To determine what will be printed by the `print(itm, end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `mex` is a list of `n` integers.
- `minn` is the next smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`.
- `maxx` is the maximum value in `mex`.
- The print statement is `print(itm, end=' ')`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `itm` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state. Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot determine the exact value of `itm`.
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that after printing `itm`, a space will be printed instead of the default newline character.

### Conclusion:
Since `itm` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can describe the output in terms of `itm`.

### Output:
Output: **itm (where itm is an undefined variable in the given initial state)**

If `itm` were to be defined elsewhere in the code (not shown here), the output would be the value of `itm` followed by a space. For the given information, we can only describe `itm` as an undefined variable.
