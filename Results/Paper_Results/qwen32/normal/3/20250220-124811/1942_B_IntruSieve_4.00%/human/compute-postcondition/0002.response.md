The given code snippet initializes an empty list `mex`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `arr`. The only change is the creation of the `mex` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `mex` is an empty list.**
