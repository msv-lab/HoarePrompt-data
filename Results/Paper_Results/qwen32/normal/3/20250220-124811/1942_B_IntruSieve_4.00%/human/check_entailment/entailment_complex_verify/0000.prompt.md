You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.

    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:

                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: `mex` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is the next smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`, and `maxx` is the maximum value in `mex`.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: `mex` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is the next smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`, and `maxx` is the maximum value in `mex`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a blank line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then computes and prints a permutation `p` of `n` integers based on the values in `a`. Each integer in the permutation is derived from the values in `a` with specific rules involving non-negative integers and absolute differences. The function outputs the permutation for each test case, followed by a blank line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed, and it does not properly handle the calculation of the MEX value and the construction of the permutation `p`.

Here's a specific counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

The program incorrectly constructs the permutation `p` as `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` instead of a valid permutation like `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.

Let's break down why this happens:

1. The program initializes `minn` to 0 and `maxx` to 0.
2. For the first element `a[0] = 1`, it appends `minn` (which is 0) to `mex`, then increments `minn` to 1.
3. For the second element `a[1] = 1`, it again appends `minn` (which is 1) to `mex`, then increments `minn` to 2.
4. For the third element `a[2] = -2`, it appends `abs(-2 - 2) = 4` to `mex` and updates `maxx` to 4.
5. For the fourth element `a[3] = 1`, it appends `minn` (which is 2) to `mex`, then increments `minn` to 3.
6. For the fifth element `a[4] = 2`, it appends `minn` (which is 3) to `mex`, then increments `minn` to 4.

This results in `mex` being `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which is not the correct permutation `p`. The program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and the construction of `p` based on the given `a`.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
