### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to reconstruct the permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \) based on the rules given in the problem description. However, the logic used in the program is flawed and does not correctly follow the rules for constructing \( p \).

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program uses `minn` to track the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation. However, it does not maintain a set of used numbers to correctly determine the MEX at each step. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer that has not been included in the permutation so far.

2. **Handling Negative Values in `a`**: The program incorrectly calculates the value for the permutation when \( a_i \) is negative. The correct value for \( p_i \) should be derived by ensuring that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The program instead uses the absolute difference which is not guaranteed to produce the correct permutation.

3. **Logic for Updating `minn` and `maxx`**: The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` is not consistent with the rules of the problem. The program increments `minn` whenever \( a_i \) is positive, which does not reflect the correct way to determine the MEX.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:

1. Maintain a set of used numbers to determine the MEX at each step.
2. For each \( a_i \), calculate the correct \( p_i \) such that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
3. Add the calculated \( p_i \) to the set of used numbers and update the MEX.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the provided program, it does not correctly reconstruct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \).

### Correctness: **False**
