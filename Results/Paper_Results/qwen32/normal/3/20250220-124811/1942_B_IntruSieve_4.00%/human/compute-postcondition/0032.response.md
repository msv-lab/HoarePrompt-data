The code snippet appends the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to the list `mex`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `mex` now includes a new element, which is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is the current index; `mex` now includes an additional element equal to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`**.
