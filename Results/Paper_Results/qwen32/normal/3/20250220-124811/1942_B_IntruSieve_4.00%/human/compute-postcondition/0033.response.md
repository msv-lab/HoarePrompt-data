The code snippet assigns the value of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the variable `maxx`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `i`, and `mex` remain unchanged. The only change is the assignment to `maxx`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is the current index; `mex` now includes an additional element equal to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`; `maxx` is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`**.
