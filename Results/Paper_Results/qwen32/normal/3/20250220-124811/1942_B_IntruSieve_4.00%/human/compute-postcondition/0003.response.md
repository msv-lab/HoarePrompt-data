Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been set to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `mex`) retain their initial values as provided in the initial state.
