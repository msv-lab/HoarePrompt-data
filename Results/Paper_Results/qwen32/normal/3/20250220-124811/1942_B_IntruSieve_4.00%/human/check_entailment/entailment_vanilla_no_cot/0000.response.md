Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). The logic for determining the MEX and constructing the permutation is flawed. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program uses `minn` to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that hasn't been used yet, but it doesn't properly account for the values of `a_i` when they are negative. The MEX should be dynamically calculated based on the current elements of the permutation being constructed.

2. **Handling Negative Values of \( a_i \)**: When `a_i` is negative, the program incorrectly calculates the next element of the permutation as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. This does not correctly account for the MEX of the current permutation.

3. **Updating MEX**: The program does not correctly update the MEX after adding each element to the permutation. The MEX should be recalculated to be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current permutation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = 0
    used = set()
    p = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        p.append(mex)
        used.add(mex)
        mex += 1
        mex -= a[i]
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

In this corrected version:
- `mex` keeps track of the smallest non-negative integer not used in the permutation.
- `used` is a set that keeps track of the elements already in the permutation.
- For each element in `a`, the program calculates the correct next element of the permutation `p` by adjusting the MEX based on the value of `a_i`.
- The program then updates the MEX and the set of used elements accordingly.

This ensures that the constructed permutation `p` satisfies the condition \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
