The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then computes and prints a permutation `p` of `n` integers based on the values in `a`. Each integer in the permutation is derived from the values in `a` with specific rules involving non-negative integers and absolute differences. The function outputs the permutation for each test case, followed by a blank line.
