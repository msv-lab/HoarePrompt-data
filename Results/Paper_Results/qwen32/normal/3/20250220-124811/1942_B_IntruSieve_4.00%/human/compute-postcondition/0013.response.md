The code snippet appends the absolute value of the difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to the list `mex`. Given that `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0 and `minn` is 0, the value being appended to `mex` will be the absolute value of `arr[i]`, which is `-arr[i]` since `arr[i]` is non-positive.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `mex` is a list containing the value `-arr[i]`; `minn` is 0; `maxx` is 0; `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0.**
