The code snippet `mex.append(minn)` appends the value of `minn` to the list `mex`. Given the initial state, only the list `mex` is affected by this operation, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is the current index; `mex` contains the previous elements of `mex` plus `minn`**.
