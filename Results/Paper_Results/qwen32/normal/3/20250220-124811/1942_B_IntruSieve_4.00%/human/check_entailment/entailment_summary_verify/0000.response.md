To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic of the function `func_1` against the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Recap
The task is to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the array `a` where:
\[ a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

The MEX (minimum excludant) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Function Analysis
The provided function `func_1` attempts to construct the permutation `p` as follows:
1. It initializes `minn` to 0 and `maxx` to 0.
2. For each element `a[i]`:
   - If `a[i] > 0`, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
   - If `a[i] <= 0`, it calculates the absolute difference `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends it to `mex`. It also updates `maxx` if the calculated value is greater than `maxx`.

### Issues in the Provided Code
Let's analyze the provided code with the example input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

- For `a[0] = 1`:
  - Since `a[0] > 0`, append `minn` (0) to `mex`.
  - `minn` becomes 1.
  - `mex = [0]`
  
- For `a[1] = 1`:
  - Since `a[1] > 0`, append `minn` (1) to `mex`.
  - `minn` becomes 2.
  - `mex = [0, 1]`
  
- For `a[2] = -2`:
  - Since `a[2] <= 0`, append `abs(-2 - 0) = 2` to `mex`.
  - `maxx` becomes 2.
  - `mex = [0, 1, 2]`
  
- For `a[3] = 1`:
  - Since `a[3] > 0`, append `minn` (2) to `mex`.
  - `minn` becomes 3.
  - `mex = [0, 1, 2, 2]`
  
- For `a[4] = 2`:
  - Since `a[4] > 0`, append `minn` (3) to `mex`.
  - `minn` becomes 4.
  - `mex = [0, 1, 2, 2, 3]`

The resulting permutation `mex` is `[0, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, which is incorrect. The expected permutation is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.

### Correct Approach
To correctly reconstruct the permutation `p`, the program should:
1. Initialize an empty set `used` to keep track of numbers already used in `p`.
2. For each `a[i]`:
   - Calculate the MEX of the current set `used`.
   - Determine `p[i]` such that `a[i] = MEX - p[i]`.
   - Add `p[i]` to the set `used`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    used = set()
    p = []
    for i in range(n):
        mex = 0
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        p.append(mex - arr[i])
        used.add(p[-1])
    for itm in p:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed, and it does not properly handle the calculation of the MEX value and the construction of the permutation `p`.

**Final: False**
