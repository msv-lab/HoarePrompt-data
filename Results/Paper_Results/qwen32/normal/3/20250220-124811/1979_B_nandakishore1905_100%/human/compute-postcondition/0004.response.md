To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information:

1. **Variables and their relationships:**
   - `n` and `m` are two distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\) and \(n \neq m\).
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., \(k = |n - m|\).
   - `k` is a power of 2.

2. **What needs to be printed:**
   - The code contains a `print(k)` statement, meaning we need to determine the value of `k`.

Given that `k` is a power of 2, we know that `k` can take values like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. However, without specific values for `n` and `m`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k`. We only know that it will be a power of 2.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `k`, which is a power of 2, but we cannot specify which exact power of 2 it will be based on the given precondition.

Output: **k (where k is a power of 2)**
