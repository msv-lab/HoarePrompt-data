Output State: **`n` is `input_n`, `m` is `input_m`, `k` is `abs(input_n - input_m)`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is `2 ** (p - 1)`**

In this output state, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and `p` retain their initial values. The new variable `q` is assigned the value `2 ** (p - 1)`, where `p` is the length of the binary string `l` representing `k`.
