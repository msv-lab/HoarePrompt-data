Output State: **`n` is `input_n`, `m` is `input_m`, `k` is `abs(input_n - input_m)`**

In this output state, the variables `n` and `m` retain their initial values, which are `input_n` and `input_m`, respectively. The new variable `k` is assigned the absolute value of the difference between `n` and `m`.
