The code calculates the length of the binary representation of `k` (which is the absolute difference between `input_n` and `input_m`) and assigns it to `p`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. The only change is the assignment of the length of `l` to `p`.

Output State: **`n` is `input_n`, `m` is `input_m`, `k` is `abs(input_n - input_m)`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`.**
