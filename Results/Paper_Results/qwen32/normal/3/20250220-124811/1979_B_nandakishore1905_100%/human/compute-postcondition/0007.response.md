The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of `k` (being the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and not a power of two, and also being odd) does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **1**
