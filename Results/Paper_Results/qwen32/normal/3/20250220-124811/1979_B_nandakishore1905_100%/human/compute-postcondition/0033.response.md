The code snippet provided is:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
```

This line of code reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are two distinct non-negative integers such that `0 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `n != m`. The value of `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and additional variables `f`, `l`, `p`, and `q` are defined based on the properties of `k`. However, the code snippet only changes the values of `n` and `m` by reading new input values.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are two distinct non-negative integers such that `0 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `n != m`, with new values assigned from the input. All other variables (`k`, `f`, `l`, `p`, `q`, `i`) remain as per their previous definitions or are not yet defined.**
