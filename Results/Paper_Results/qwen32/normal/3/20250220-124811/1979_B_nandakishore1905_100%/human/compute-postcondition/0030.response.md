Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are two distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 10^9 and n != m; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The value of `k` is not a power of two. If `k` is odd, no additional variables are introduced. If `k` is even, `f` is the largest power of two less than or equal to `k - 2`; `l` is the binary string representation of `f`; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is `f`.**
