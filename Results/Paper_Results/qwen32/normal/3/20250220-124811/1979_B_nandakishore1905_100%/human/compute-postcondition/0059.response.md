Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are two distinct non-negative integers such that `0 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `n != m`; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, the state remains as described. Otherwise, if `k` is odd, the state remains as described. If `k` is even and not a power of 2, then `n` is 5, `m` is 0, `k` is 5, `l` is "11", `p` is 2, `q` is 2, and `f` is 1.**
