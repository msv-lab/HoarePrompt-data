Output State: **`n` and `m` are two distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 10^9 and n != m; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

In natural language: The values of `n` and `m` remain the same as they were initially, and a new variable `k` is introduced, which holds the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
