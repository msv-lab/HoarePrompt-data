Let's break down the task step by step based on the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `i` is assigned the value of `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`:** 
   - It is mentioned that `n` must be at least 3. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified. For the purpose of this explanation, we'll denote `n` as a value that satisfies the condition \( n \geq 3 \).

2. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly stated to be equal to `n`. Therefore, `i` also holds the same value as `n`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(i, i)` statement will output the value of `i` twice, separated by a space.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is at least 3, the print statement will output the value of `n` twice.

### Output:
Output: **n, n (where n is at least 3)**
