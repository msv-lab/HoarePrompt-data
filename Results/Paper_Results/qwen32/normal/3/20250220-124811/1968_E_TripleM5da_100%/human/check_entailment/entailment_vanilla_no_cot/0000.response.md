Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \( n \). 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **For \( n = 2 \)**: The program correctly outputs the points (1, 1) and (1, 2), which gives the set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\). This is optimal.

2. **For \( n = 3 \)**: The program outputs (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). The Manhattan distances are:
   - Between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
   - Between (1, 1) and (3, 3): \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
   - Between (1, 2) and (3, 3): \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
   
   Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 3, 4\}\). However, the optimal configuration is (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), which gives \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

3. **For \( n > 3 \)**: The pattern of outputs does not ensure that the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances are achieved. The points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3) onwards do not guarantee the maximum diversity in distances.

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), a different strategy is required. One such strategy is to place points in a way that maximizes the variety of distances, such as placing points along a diagonal and ensuring they are spaced out to cover a wide range of distances.

Here is an example of a corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        points = []
        for i in range(n):
            points.append((i + 1, 1))
        for i in range(n - 1):
            points.append((1, i + 2))
        for i in range(n - 2):
            points.append((n, i + 3))
        for i in range(n - 3):
            points.append((i + 2, n))
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(points[i][0], points[i][1])
        print(points[0][0], points[0][1])

func()
```

This approach ensures that a wide range of Manhattan distances are covered by placing points in a strategic manner. However, the exact implementation details can vary, and the above is just one example of how it can be done.
