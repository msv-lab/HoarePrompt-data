To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the range of the loop and the values printed in each iteration.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    print(i, i)
```

This loop will iterate from `i = 3` to `i = n` inclusive. The number of iterations is `n - 2` because the range starts at 3 and goes up to `n`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that `n` must be at least 5 for the loop to execute 3 times. To find the final output state, we need to consider the case when the loop executes all possible iterations up to `n`.

The loop will print each value of `i` from 3 to `n` twice. For example, if `n = 5`, the loop will print:
```
3 3
4 4
5 5
```

If `n = 6`, the loop will print:
```
3 3
4 4
5 5
6 6
```

Thus, the final output state will depend on the value of `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop and is not affected by the loop's execution.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is the integer value obtained from the input() function, and the loop prints each integer `i` from 3 to `n` twice.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `t` remains the same, and the loop has printed all integers from 3 to `n` inclusive, each printed twice.
