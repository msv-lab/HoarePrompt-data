The `print(1, 2)` statement in the provided Python code snippet does not depend on the variables `t` and `n` described in the initial state. The `print` function in Python outputs the values provided to it, separated by spaces by default. Here, the values 1 and 2 are explicitly provided as arguments to the `print` function.

Therefore, the output will simply be the numbers 1 and 2, separated by a space.

Output: **1 2**
