To determine the output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    print(i, i)
```

- The loop starts with `i` initialized to 3 and continues until `i` reaches `n`.
- In each iteration, the loop prints the current value of `i` twice.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is unchanged.
- `n` is the integer value of the input.
- `i` is `n`.

The loop will execute for all integer values of `i` from 3 to `n`.

### Analysis of the Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute `n - 2` times if `n >= 3` (since it starts at 3 and goes up to `n` inclusive).
- After the loop completes, the value of `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop variable `i` is incremented to `n + 1` after the last iteration, but this value of `i` is not used in the loop body.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains unchanged as per the precondition.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the input value and not modified in the loop.
- `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **t is unchanged, n is the integer value of the input, and i is n + 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `t` stays the same as it was initially, `n` retains its input value, and `i` is incremented to `n + 1`.
