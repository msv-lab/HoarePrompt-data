The loop condition is `while heap[0] <= current_median:`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the smallest element in the `heap` (`heap[0]`) must be less than or equal to the `current_median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added.
- `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `heap[0]` to be less than or equal to `current_median`. Since `heap[0]` is `smallest + 1`, we need to ensure that `smallest + 1` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

If `smallest + 1` is already less than or equal to `current_median`, no adjustment is needed. However, if it's greater than `current_median`, we need to adjust `smallest` to be less than `current_median`.

Given that we can only adjust the objects in the loop head, and `heap[0]` is derived from `smallest`, we can adjust `smallest` to be less than `current_median`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list containing the value 0 and the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added, `operations` is 1, `smallest` must be less than `current_median`**
