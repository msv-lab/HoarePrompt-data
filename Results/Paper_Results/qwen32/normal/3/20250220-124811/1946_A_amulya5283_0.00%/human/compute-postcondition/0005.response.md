The code snippet assigns the value of the element at `median_index` in the sorted list `arr` to the variable `current_median`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `median_index` is calculated as `n // 2` and `arr` is the sorted list from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `current_median` will be the value at the middle index of `arr`. If `n` is odd, this will be the middle element. If `n` is even, this will be the lower of the two middle elements.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `i` is set to a valid index, `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.**
