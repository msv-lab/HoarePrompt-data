The code snippet provided simply appends the value of `operations` to the `results` list. This means that the `results` list, which initially contained the value `0` and the value of `operations`, will now have another `operations` value appended to it.

Here is the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` remains a list of `t` tuples.
- `results` now contains three elements: `0`, the initial value of `operations`, and the current value of `operations` (appended by the code snippet).
- `i` is `i + 2`.
- `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.
- `arr` is the sorted second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`.
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with all elements greater than `current_median`.
- `operations` remains the total number of iterations the loop executed.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list containing 0, the initial value of `operations`, and the current value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with all elements greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of iterations the loop executed**.
