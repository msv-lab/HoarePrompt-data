The code snippet provided removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. Given the initial state, the heap is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added. Therefore, after `heapq.heappop(heap)` is executed, `smallest` will take the value of the smallest element in the heap, which is the second smallest element in the original heapified `arr[median_index:]` (since the smallest element was removed and `smallest + 1` was added).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list containing the value 0 and the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the second smallest element in the original heapified `arr[median_index:]`.**
