To determine the final state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop continues to execute as long as the smallest element in the `heap` is less than or equal to the `current_median`. Each iteration involves removing the smallest element from the `heap`, incrementing it by 1, and then pushing it back into the `heap`. The `operations` counter is incremented with each iteration.

The loop terminates when the smallest element in the `heap` is greater than the `current_median`. At this point, all elements in the `heap` are greater than the `current_median`, and the `heap` reflects the state after all necessary increments.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop continues until the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is no longer satisfied. The final state will be:

- `t` remains the same as the initial state.
- `test_cases` remains the same as the initial state.
- `results` remains the same as the initial state (empty list).
- `i` remains the same as the initial state.
- `n` remains the same as the initial state.
- `arr` remains the same as the initial state.
- `median_index` remains the same as the initial state.
- `current_median` remains the same as the initial state.
- `heap` will be a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`.
- `smallest` will be the last element that was removed from the heap and incremented, but since the loop has terminated, `smallest` is not a variable in the final state.
- `operations` will be the total number of iterations the loop executed until it terminated.

Let's summarize the final state in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `i` is set to a valid index, `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the total number of iterations the loop executed until it terminated.**

In simpler terms, the loop continues until all elements in the heap are greater than the current median, and the final state reflects this condition with the `heap` updated accordingly and the `operations` counter showing the total number of increments performed.
