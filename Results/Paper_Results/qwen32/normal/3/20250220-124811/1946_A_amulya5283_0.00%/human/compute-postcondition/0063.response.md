The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` adds the value `smallest + 1` to the heap, maintaining the heap property. This means that `heap` will now contain all its previous elements plus the new element `smallest + 1`, and the smallest element in the heap will still be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given the initial state, the value of `smallest` is the element that was previously the smallest in `heap` and has now been removed from it. Therefore, `smallest + 1` is the new element being added to the heap.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list containing the value 0 and the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added such that `heap[0] <= current_median`, `operations` is 2, `smallest` is the element that was previously the smallest in `heap` and has now been removed from it.**

In natural language: The heap now includes the new element `smallest + 1`, ensuring the heap property is maintained. All other variables remain unchanged.
