The code `heapq.heapify(heap)` transforms the list `heap` into a heap data structure in-place. This operation does not change the values of the elements in `heap` but reorganizes them to satisfy the heap property. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `i` is set to a valid index, `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`.**
