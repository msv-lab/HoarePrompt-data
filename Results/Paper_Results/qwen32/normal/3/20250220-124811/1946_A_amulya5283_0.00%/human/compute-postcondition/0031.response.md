To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`. This condition depends on the values of `heap[0]` and `current_median`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify the relevant variables**: The loop condition `heap[0] <= current_median` involves `heap[0]` and `current_median`.
2. **Understand the context**: 
   - `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`.
   - `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`.
   - `median_index` is `n // 2`, so `current_median` is the middle element of the sorted list `arr`.
3. **Condition for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given that `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to ensure that the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]` (which is `heap[0]`) is less than or equal to `current_median`.

### Adjusting the state:

- **`heap[0]`**: This is the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.
- **`current_median`**: This is `arr[median_index]`, the middle element of the sorted list `arr`.

Since `heap` is derived from `arr[median_index:]`, and `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, we need to ensure that the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]` is less than or equal to `arr[median_index]`.

### Conclusion:

To make sure the loop executes, we need to ensure that the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]` is less than or equal to `arr[median_index]`. This can be achieved by ensuring that `arr[median_index]` is the largest element in `arr[median_index:]` or by ensuring that `arr[median_index]` is not the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]`.

However, since `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `arr[median_index]` is already the middle element, and `heap[0]` will be `arr[median_index]` or smaller if `n` is odd, or the element just after `arr[median_index]` if `n` is even.

Therefore, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 (so that `heap` contains more than one element) and `arr[median_index]` is not the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1 and `arr` is properly sorted.

### Final State:

Since the problem guarantees that `arr` is sorted and `heap` is derived from `arr[median_index:]`, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, no additional adjustment is needed beyond ensuring `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is a list containing the value 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`, `operations` is 0**
