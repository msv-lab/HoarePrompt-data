### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of an array. The median is defined as the middle element of a sorted array. If the array length is odd, it's the middle element; if even, it's the larger of the two middle elements when considering the ceiling of half the length.

The provided code follows these steps:
1. **Reading Input:** It reads the number of test cases and the corresponding arrays.
2. **Sorting:** For each test case, it sorts the array.
3. **Median Calculation:** It identifies the median index and the current median value.
4. **Heap Operations:** It uses a min-heap to keep track of the elements from the median index to the end of the array. It then repeatedly pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median. The number of such operations is counted as the result.

### Analysis:

- **Heap Initialization:** The heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is correct because these are the elements that need to be considered to increase the median.
- **Heap Operations:** The loop continues until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median. Each operation increments the smallest element, ensuring that the median is increased.
- **Correctness:** The approach is correct in that it ensures the minimum number of operations to increase the median. By always incrementing the smallest element, it ensures that the median is increased as efficiently as possible.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array for each test case.

**Correctness:** **True**
