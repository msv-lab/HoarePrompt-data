### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to easily find the median.
2. **Identifying the Median**: The median is identified based on the length of the array. If `n` is odd, the median is the middle element. If `n` is even, the median is the larger of the two middle elements (due to the `ceil` function).
3. **Heap Construction**: A heap is constructed from the second half of the sorted array (including the median if `n` is odd). This heap is used to efficiently find and modify the smallest element that is greater than or equal to the current median.
4. **Incrementing Operations**: The program repeatedly extracts the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap. This process continues until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.
5. **Counting Operations**: The number of operations is counted and stored for each test case.

The logic of using a heap to find and modify the smallest element efficiently is correct. The operations count correctly reflects the number of increments needed to ensure the median increases.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The use of a heap ensures that the operations are performed efficiently. Therefore, the program should work as intended for the given problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
