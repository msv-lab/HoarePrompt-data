The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. This operation changes the heap and the value of `smallest`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
- `results` is a list containing the value 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 1.
- `arr` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`.
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and now includes the value `smallest + 1` such that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.
- `operations` is 2.
- `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from the heap.
- `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

After executing `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)`, the smallest element in `heap` is removed and assigned to `smallest`. The heap is now one element smaller, and `heap[0]` will be the new smallest element in the heap.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is a list containing the value 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` and `n` must be greater than 1; `arr` is the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with one element removed; `operations` is 2; `smallest` is the smallest element removed from the heap; `heap[0]` is the new smallest element in the heap and must be less than or equal to `current_median`.**
