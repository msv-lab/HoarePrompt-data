The code snippet `n, arr = test_cases[i]` assigns the `i`-th tuple from the `test_cases` list to the variables `n` and `arr`. Specifically, `n` is assigned the first element of the tuple (which is an integer), and `arr` is assigned the second element of the tuple (which is a list of integers).

Given the initial state, `i` is not set before the loop starts, so we need to assume `i` has been set to a valid index within the range of `test_cases` for this operation to be valid. Since `i` is not specified, we will keep it as `i` in the output state.

The variables `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `i` is set to a valid index, `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the list from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`.**
