The code snippet provided updates the `heap` variable to be a slice of the `arr` list starting from the `median_index` to the end of the list. This means `heap` now contains all elements of `arr` that are greater than or equal to the `current_median`.

Given the initial state, the `median_index` is calculated as `n // 2`, and `current_median` is the value at `arr[median_index]`. Therefore, `heap` will consist of elements from `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, `results` is a list containing the value 0 and the value of `operations`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value of `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]`, `operations` is the total number of operations performed.**
