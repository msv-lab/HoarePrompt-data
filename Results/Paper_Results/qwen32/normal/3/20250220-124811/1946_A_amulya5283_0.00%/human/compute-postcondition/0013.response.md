The loop condition is `while heap[0] <= current_median:`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the smallest element in `heap` (i.e., `heap[0]`) must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given the current state:
- `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added.
- `smallest` is the smallest element removed from `heap`.
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since `heap` is a heapified list with `smallest + 1` added to it, we can adjust `heap[0]` by ensuring that `smallest + 1` is less than or equal to `current_median`. This can be achieved by ensuring that `smallest` is less than `current_median`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `heap[0]` to be less than or equal to `current_median`. Since `heap[0]` is `smallest + 1`, we need to ensure that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple represents a test case consisting of an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list, `i` is set to a valid index, `n` is the integer from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted list from the `i`-th tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added, `smallest` is the smallest element removed from `heap` such that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`, `operations` is 1**
