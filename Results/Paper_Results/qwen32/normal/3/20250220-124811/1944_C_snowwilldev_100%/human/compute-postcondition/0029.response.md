Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. Based on the conditions specified in the test cases, the function returns 0 in Case_1, 1 in Case_2, and an incremented value `i` in Case_3.**
