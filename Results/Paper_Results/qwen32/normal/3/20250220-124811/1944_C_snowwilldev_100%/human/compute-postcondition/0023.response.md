The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1 and `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0. Since the program does not change the values of `t` and `cnt[i]` under the given conditions, these values remain the same. The loop will continue if `i` is less than `N + 1`.

Given that `t` is 1 and `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is incremented and is still less than `N + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value, and for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. We need to ensure that after incrementing `i`, it is still less than `N + 1`.

State: **`t` is 1, `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` must be less than `N + 1`**

To make it more specific, if `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`. Therefore:

State: **`t` is 1, `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `k + 1` must be less than `N + 1`**

Since we do not have the specific value of `k`, we can generalize it to:

State: **`t` is 1, `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` must be less than `N + 1`**

However, to match the format of the previous examples, we can write:

State: **`t` is 1, `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
