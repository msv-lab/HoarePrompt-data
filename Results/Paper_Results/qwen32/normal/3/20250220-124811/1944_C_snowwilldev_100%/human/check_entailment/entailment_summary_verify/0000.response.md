### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Optimal Play**:
   - The problem requires simulating the game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a` to build the array `c` and then determining the MEX of `c` after the game ends.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The optimal strategy involves both players making choices that affect the final composition of `c`.

2. **Key Flaw**:
   - The provided program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly computes the MEX based on the counts of elements without considering the order in which elements are chosen.
   - The function `func_1` counts the occurrences of each number and returns the smallest number `i` such that `i` either has zero occurrences or at least two integers in the list have exactly one occurrence each. This approach does not account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.
   - For example, in the first test case:
     ```
     4
     0 0 1 1
     ```
     The program will return `2` because `0` and `1` both appear twice, and `2` is the smallest number not appearing. However, the correct strategy involves Alice and Bob making choices that affect the final MEX. In this case, Alice can ensure that `2` is the MEX by playing optimally.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     4
     0 0 1 2
     ```
     The optimal play could be:
     - Alice picks `2`, `c = [2]`, `a = [0, 0, 1]`.
     - Bob picks `0`, `c = [2]`, `a = [0, 1]`.
     - Alice picks `1`, `c = [2, 1]`, `a = [0]`.
     - Bob picks `0`, `c = [2, 1]`, `a = []`.
     - The MEX of `c` is `0`, not `2` as the program would output.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, one must simulate the game turns and consider the optimal moves for both players. The provided program does not do this and thus does not yield the correct result.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the game and does not account for the strategic decisions made by Alice and Bob. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
