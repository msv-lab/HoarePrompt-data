The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring into an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state, `a` is a list of `N` integers. After executing the code, `a` will be updated to the list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `N` is an integer read from input, where 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `N` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < N, with the sum of `N` over all test cases not exceeding 2 · 10^5. The list `a` has been updated to the list of integers read from the input.**
