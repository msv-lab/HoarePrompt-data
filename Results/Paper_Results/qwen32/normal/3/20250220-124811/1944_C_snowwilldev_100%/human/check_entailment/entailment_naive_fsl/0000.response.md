Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Optimal Play**:
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The program simply counts the occurrences of each number and returns the smallest number that either appears once or does not appear at all. This does not account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.

2. **Key Flaw**:
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It directly computes the MEX based on the counts of elements without considering the order in which elements are chosen.
   - For example, in the first test case:
     ```
     4
     0 0 1 1
     ```
     The program will return `2` because `0` and `1` both appear twice, and `2` is the smallest number not appearing. However, the correct strategy involves Alice and Bob making choices that affect the final MEX. In this case, Alice can ensure that `2` is the MEX by playing optimally.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     4
     0 0 1 2
     ```
     The optimal play could be:
     - Alice picks `2`, `c = [2]`, `a = [0, 0, 1]`.
     - Bob picks `0`, `c = [2]`, `a = [0, 1]`.
     - Alice picks `1`, `c = [2, 1]`, `a = [0]`.
     - Bob picks `0`, `c = [2, 1]`, `a = []`.
     - The MEX of `c` is `0`, not `2` as the program would output.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly simulate the game and does not account for the strategic decisions made by Alice and Bob. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Thus, the program is incorrect for the given problem description, and the Correctness is **False**.
