### Reasoning:

The goal of the game is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

The provided program counts the occurrences of each integer in the input array `a`. It then iterates through non-negative integers starting from 0 and checks two conditions:
1. If an integer `i` has exactly one occurrence in `a`, it increments a counter `t`.
2. If `t` reaches 2 (meaning there are at least two distinct integers each appearing exactly once) or if an integer `i` has zero occurrences, the program returns `i`.

This logic is based on the observation that for the MEX to be as high as possible, we need to ensure that as many lower integers as possible appear exactly once in `c` (since Alice wants to maximize the MEX). However, Bob will try to prevent this by deleting elements strategically, so the key is to identify the smallest integer that either:
- Does not appear in `a` at all, or
- Is the first integer that appears more than once after some elements have been removed.

Let's analyze the provided test cases:
1. For `a = [0, 0, 1, 1]`:
   - `cnt` will be `{0: 2, 1: 2}`.
   - Since no integer appears exactly once, the function will return the first integer that has zero occurrences, which is `2`.
   - This matches the expected output of `2`.

2. For `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]`:
   - `cnt` will be `{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}`.
   - The function will increment `t` for each integer from 0 to 3, reaching a count of 4.
   - Since `t` reaches 2 (actually 4, but the condition is met at 2), the function will return `1` as the first integer that meets the condition.
   - This matches the expected output of `1`.

3. For `a = [1, 1]`:
   - `cnt` will be `{1: 2}`.
   - Since no integer appears exactly once, the function will return the first integer that has zero occurrences, which is `0`.
   - This matches the expected output of `0`.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX based on the optimal play by Alice and Bob. It efficiently counts the occurrences and checks the conditions to find the correct MEX.
