Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `N` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `N` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < N, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer values where `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`, and `i` is equal to `N`.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations, the `cnt` dictionary will have the count of each integer in the list `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to `N`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. All other variables (`t` and `N`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
