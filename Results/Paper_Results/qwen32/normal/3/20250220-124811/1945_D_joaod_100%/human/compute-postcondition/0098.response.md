The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns these integers to the variable `custo_pra_passar_b`. The other variables (`c`, `cases`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `cases` must be greater than the new value of `c`.
- `na_frente` is an integer from the input.
- `pos_final` is an integer from the input.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input.

After executing the provided code:
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is assigned a new list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `cases` must be greater than the new value of `c`, `na_frente` is an integer from the input, `pos_final` is an integer from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers from the input.**
