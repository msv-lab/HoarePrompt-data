To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, we need to understand the initial state provided. However, the initial state in this case does not provide any information about the variable `best`. Therefore, we cannot determine an explicit value for `best` based on the given information.

Since there is no information about the variable `best`, we can only provide a description that it will print the value of `best` as it is currently defined in the program.

Output: **best (where best is the value of the variable best)**
