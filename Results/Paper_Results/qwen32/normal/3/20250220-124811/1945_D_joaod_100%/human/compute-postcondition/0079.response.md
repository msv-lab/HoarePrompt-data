Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1, `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers as read from the input, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` remains unchanged unless `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `best`, `c` is `c + 1`, `v` is `v - 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The `total` has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to it. The values of `best`, `c`, and `v` are updated based on the conditions described, but `total` is specifically increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
