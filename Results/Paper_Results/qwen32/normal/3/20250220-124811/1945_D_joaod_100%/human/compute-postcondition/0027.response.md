Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1; `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 (and must be at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers as read from the input; `v` is `na_frente - 1`; `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

In simple terms, the variable `best` is now equal to the sum of `total` and the value at index `v` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. All other variables retain their initial values.
