To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `c in range(cases)`. Therefore, the variables `c` and `cases` are the only ones we can adjust.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `c`**: This variable is the loop counter and will be initialized automatically by the `range` function. We do not need to set an initial value for `c` before the loop starts because it will be set to 0 by default when the loop begins.

2. **Variable `cases`**: This variable determines how many times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute at least once, `cases` must be at least 1. Given that `cases` is already defined as an integer equal to the input value, we need to ensure that the input value for `cases` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for `c` because it is automatically managed by the `range` function. However, we need to ensure that `cases` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1**
