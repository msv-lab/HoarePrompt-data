Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = sys.float_info.max
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1; `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 (and must be at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers as read from the input; `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` down to `0`; `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` down to `0` where `v <= pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: 

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: - `c` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `cases` is greater than the new value of `c`.
- `na_frente` is `0` (since the loop iterates down to `0`).
- `pos_final` remains the same as the initial value decremented by 1.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain the same as the input lists.
- `total` is the sum of the costs determined by the loop's conditions.
- `best` is the minimum cost encountered during the loop's execution that satisfies the condition `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` when `v <= pos_final`.

In natural language, the output state after all iterations means that the loop has processed all values from `na_frente` down to `0`, updating the `total` cost based on the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v`. The `best` variable holds the minimum total cost encountered when `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`. All other variables remain unchanged except for `c` which is incremented by 1, and `na_frente` which is decremented to `0`.

Output State:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
