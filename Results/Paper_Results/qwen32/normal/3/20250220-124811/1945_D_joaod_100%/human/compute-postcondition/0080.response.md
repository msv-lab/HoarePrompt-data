Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1, `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a new list of integers as read from the input, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` remains unchanged unless `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `best`, `c` is `c + 1`, `v` is `v - 1`**.

In simple terms, the `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The `best` value might change if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current `best`. The variables `c` and `v` are incremented and decremented respectively by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
