The only variable in the loop head is `v`. According to the loop statement, `v` is initialized to `na_frente` and decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1. At the end of the previous iteration, `v` is `na_frente`, `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 (and must be at least 0), and the loop continues as long as `v` is greater than or equal to 0.

To execute one more time, `v` needs to be decremented by 1 from its current value. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `v` should be `na_frente - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `cases` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 1; `na_frente` is an integer as read from the input minus 1 (and must be at least 0); `pos_final` is an integer as read from the input minus 1; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers as read from the input; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers as read from the input; `v` is `na_frente - 1`**
