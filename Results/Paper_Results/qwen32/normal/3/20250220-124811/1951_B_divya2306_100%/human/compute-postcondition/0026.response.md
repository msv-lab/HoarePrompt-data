Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different; `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are not greater than `a[k-1]` and `wins` is less than k - 1; `i` is the index where `a[i] > a[k-1]` if such an element exists, otherwise `i` remains n-1; `win_with_swap` is `wins + 2` if `a[i] > a[k-1]`, otherwise `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1` and is less than k - 1.**

Explanation: The value of `win_with_swap` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, if `a[i] > a[k-1]`, `win_with_swap` is now `wins + 2`; otherwise, it is `wins + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
