Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different; `wins` is 0; `i` is 0; `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `wins`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
