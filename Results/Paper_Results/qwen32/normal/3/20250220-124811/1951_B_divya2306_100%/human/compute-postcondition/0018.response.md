To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and all `a_i` are pairwise different.
- `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are not greater than `a[k-1]`.
- `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise the index where `a[i] > a[k-1]`.
- `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(wins - 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `wins`:**
   - `wins` is defined as the number of elements in the list `a` that are not greater than `a[k-1]`. In other words, `wins` is the count of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`.
   
2. **Understanding the Output:**
   - The code snippet prints `wins - 1`.
   - Since `wins` is the count of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]`, subtracting 1 from `wins` will give the count of elements in `a` that are strictly less than `a[k-1]`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be the number of elements in the list `a` that are strictly less than `a[k-1]`.

### Final Output:
Output: **wins - 1 (where wins is the number of elements in the list `a` that are not greater than `a[k-1]`)**

To make it more precise and understandable:
Output: **the number of elements in the list `a` that are strictly less than `a[k-1]`**
