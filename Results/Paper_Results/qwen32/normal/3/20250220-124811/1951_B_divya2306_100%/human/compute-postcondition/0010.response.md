Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different; `wins` is 1; `i` is 1. If `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
