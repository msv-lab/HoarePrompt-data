Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are pairwise different. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input.**

In simple terms, the value of `t` remains unchanged, while `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input. The list `a` and its properties remain as initially described.
