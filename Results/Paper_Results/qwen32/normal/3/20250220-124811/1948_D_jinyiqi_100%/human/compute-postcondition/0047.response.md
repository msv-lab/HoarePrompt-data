Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 1. If `count` is equal to `j`, the program returns nothing. Otherwise, the program does nothing and `count` retains its value.**
