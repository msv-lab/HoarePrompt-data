To determine what will be printed by the `print(count * 2)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark (`?`).
   - `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 2.
   - `j` is initialized to 0.
   - `k` is initialized to `k + 1` (which implies `k` is initially 1, because it starts at 0 and then increments by 1).
   - The `count` variable is increased by 1 if any of the following conditions are true:
     - `s[k] == '?'`
     - `s[k + j] == '?'`
     - `s[k] == s[k + j]`
   - Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Given `k` starts at 1 and `j` is 0, the conditions to increase `count` are:
     - `s[1] == '?'`
     - `s[1 + 0] == '?'` (which is the same as `s[1] == '?'`)
     - `s[1] == s[1 + 0]` (which is the same as `s[1] == s[1]`, always true)
   - Since `s[1] == s[1]` is always true, `count` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `count` will be 1 after the first iteration of the condition check.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement is `print(count * 2)`.
   - Since `count` is 1, `count * 2` will be 2.

Thus, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **2**
