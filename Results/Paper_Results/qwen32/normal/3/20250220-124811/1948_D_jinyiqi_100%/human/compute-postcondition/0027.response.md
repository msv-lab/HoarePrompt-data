Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters where each character is a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark, `n` is the length of the list `s` and is at least 2, `j` is 0, `k` is `k + 1`. If `count == j`, the program does not return any value. Otherwise, no specific change is made to the variables `t`, `s`, `n`, `j`, or `k`.**
