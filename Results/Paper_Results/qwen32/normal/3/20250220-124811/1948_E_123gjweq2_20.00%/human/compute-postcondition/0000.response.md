Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), and clique is an integer representing the clique number to which the vertices in the range [left, right] will be assigned. `small_element` is `left + 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `small_element` is now `left + 1`, while the values of `left`, `right`, and `clique` remain unchanged.
