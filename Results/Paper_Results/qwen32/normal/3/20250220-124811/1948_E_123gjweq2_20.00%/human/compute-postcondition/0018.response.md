The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `not_mid`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's break down the given state and adjust `i` accordingly:

- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`.
- `clique` is an integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.
- `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i` for `i` in `[0, mid)`.
- `cliques[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `[0, mid)`.
- `arr[left + mid]` is `big_element`.
- `cliques[left + mid]` is `clique`.
- `i` is 0.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `cliques[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `arr[left + mid]` is `big_element`; `cliques[left + mid]` is `clique`; `i` is 1**.
