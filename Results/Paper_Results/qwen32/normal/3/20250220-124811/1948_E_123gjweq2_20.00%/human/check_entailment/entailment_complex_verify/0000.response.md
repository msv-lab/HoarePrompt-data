### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, the annotations, and the original assessment.

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use `arr` and `cliquess` without declaring them as global. This is indeed an issue because these variables are not initialized within the functions. In Python, variables defined outside of a function are considered global unless explicitly declared as such within the function. However, the annotations seem to imply that `arr` and `cliquess` are being modified within `make_array` and used in `func_1`, so this issue should be addressed by declaring them as global within `make_array`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `cliques`**: The calculation of `cliques` as `ceil(n / k)` is incorrect. The problem requires a more nuanced approach to determine the minimum number of cliques based on the given constraints. The current logic does not ensure that every pair of vertices that should be connected based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` are indeed in the same clique.

3. **Incorrect Array Assignment**: The function `make_array` does not correctly assign the values to `arr` and `cliquess`. The logic for assigning values and cliques does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs of vertices. The current implementation fills the arrays in a way that does not respect the edge condition.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the results directly from the functions, which is not suitable for handling multiple test cases as required by the problem description. The results should be collected and printed after processing all test cases.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n` is small or `k` is large, the current logic may not produce the correct number of cliques or the correct partition.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`. The program might output:

```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```

However, this output might not satisfy the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` for all pairs of vertices. For instance, for `i = 1` and `j = 3`, `|1 - 3| + |3 - 5| = 2 + 2 = 4`, which is equal to `k`, but the vertices 1 and 3 are in different cliques (1 and 2 respectively), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description and fails to handle various edge cases. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
