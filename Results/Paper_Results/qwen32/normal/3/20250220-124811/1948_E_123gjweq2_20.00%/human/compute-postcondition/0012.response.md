The code snippet modifies the element at the index `left + i` in the array `arr` by setting it to `small_element + i`. Given the initial state, `small_element` is `left + 1`, so `small_element + i` becomes `(left + 1) + i`.

Therefore, `arr[left + i]` is updated to `(left + 1) + i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
