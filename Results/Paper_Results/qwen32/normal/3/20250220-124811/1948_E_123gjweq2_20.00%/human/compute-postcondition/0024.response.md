To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays. The loop runs for `not_mid` iterations, which is defined as `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`. This simplifies to `(right - left + 1) // 2`.

The loop assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` starting from the index `left + mid` up to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`. Specifically, it assigns `big_element - i` to `arr[left + mid + i]` and `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]` for each iteration `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.

Given the initial conditions and the pattern observed in the first 3 iterations, we can generalize the final state after all iterations. The final state will have the first `mid` elements of `arr` and `cliquess` in their initial state, and the next `not_mid` elements will be filled with decreasing values starting from `big_element` down to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`.

Let's formalize this:

- `arr[left + i]` for `i` in `[0, mid)` remains `(left + 1) + i`.
- `cliquess[left + i]` for `i` in `[0, mid)` remains `clique`.
- `arr[left + mid + i]` for `i` in `[0, not_mid)` is `big_element - i`.
- `cliquess[left + mid + i]` for `i` in `[0, not_mid)` is `clique`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `cliques[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for `i` in `[0, not_mid)`; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `[0, not_mid)`; `i` is `not_mid - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, the first half of the segment from `left` to `right` (up to `mid`) remains unchanged, and the second half (from `mid` to `right`) is filled with values starting from `big_element` and decreasing by 1 for each subsequent element, with all corresponding `cliquess` values set to `clique`.
