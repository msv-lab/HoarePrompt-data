### Reasoning:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without declaring them as global. This is indeed a mistake because these variables are not initialized within the functions, leading to errors. However, the annotations suggest that the program implicitly uses these variables, which might work in some environments but is not a good practice. For the purpose of this evaluation, we will assume the variables are implicitly global and focus on the core logic.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `cliques`**: The calculation of `cliques` in `func_1` as `ceil(n / k)` is incorrect. The problem requires determining the minimum number of cliques such that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` holds for all pairs of vertices in the same clique. The current approach does not ensure this condition is met, as it simply divides the vertices into segments of size `k`.

3. **Incorrect Array Assignment**: The function `make_array` does not correctly assign values to `arr` and `cliquess` to satisfy the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`. The logic for assigning values and cliques does not ensure that all pairs of vertices within the same clique meet the condition. The annotations indicate that the function assigns values in a way that does not guarantee the required connectivity within each clique.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the results directly from the functions, which is not ideal for handling multiple test cases. However, the annotations suggest that the program processes each test case separately, so this issue is less critical for the correctness of the solution.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, when `n` is small or `k` is large, the current logic may not produce the correct number of cliques or the correct partition. The annotations do not address these edge cases, and the example provided in the original assessment shows that the program might not satisfy the required condition for all pairs of vertices.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`. The program might output:

```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```

However, this output might not satisfy the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` for all pairs of vertices. For instance, for `i = 1` and `j = 3`, `|1 - 3| + |3 - 5| = 2 + 2 = 4`, which is equal to `k`, but the vertices 1 and 3 are in different cliques (1 and 2 respectively), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description and fails to handle various edge cases. The annotations do not provide evidence that the program satisfies the condition for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
