The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented again, and it must still be less than `mid`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, provided that `i + 1 < mid`.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is incremented by 1**
