The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `not_mid`. If `i` is less than `not_mid`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`, which is the number of iterations the loop will run. 

The other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, `arr`, and `cliques`) should remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `cliques[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `arr[left + mid]` is `big_element`; `cliques[left + mid]` is `clique`; `arr[left + mid + 1]` is `big_element - 1`; `cliques[left + mid + 1]` is `clique`; `i` is 2**
