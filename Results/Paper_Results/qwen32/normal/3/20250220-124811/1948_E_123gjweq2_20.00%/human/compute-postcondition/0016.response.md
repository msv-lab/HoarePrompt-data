The code modifies the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is 0, so the specific value being modified is `arr[left + mid]`.

Here is the breakdown of the changes:
- `arr[left + mid]` is set to `big_element - i`, which simplifies to `big_element - 0` or simply `big_element`.

No other variables are directly modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `cliques[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `arr[left + mid]` is `big_element`; `i` is 0.**
