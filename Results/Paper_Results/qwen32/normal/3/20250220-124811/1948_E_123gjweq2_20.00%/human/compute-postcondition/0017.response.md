The provided code snippet assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `cliquess[left + mid]` is set to `clique`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)` and `right - left >= 2`; `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`; `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `(left + 1) + i` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `cliques[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `[0, mid)`; `arr[left + mid]` is `big_element`; `cliquess[left + mid]` is `clique`; `i` is 0.**

This means that the element at index `left + mid` in the `cliquess` array has been updated to the value of `clique`. All other variables retain their initial values.
