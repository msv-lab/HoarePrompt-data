Functionality: **The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), and `clique` is an integer representing the clique number. The function modifies the array `arr` by assigning the value of `clique` to each element in the range from `left` to `right` (inclusive).**
