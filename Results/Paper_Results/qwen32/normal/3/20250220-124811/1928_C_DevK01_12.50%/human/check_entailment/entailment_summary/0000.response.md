Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by determining the possible values of `k` for each test case based on Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x`. The program calculates potential `k` values by considering the periodic nature of the sequence and checking divisors of a derived value `(n + x) // 2` (and `(n - x) // 2` if `n >= 3 * x - 2`).

However, there are several issues with the program that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:** The function `func_1` is supposed to find all possible `k` values based on the conditions described, but it is incorrectly used in the main loop. The function is called with `((y - 2) // 2, x)` and `((n - x) // 2, x)`, but it should be called with parameters that directly relate to the possible `k` values. The current approach does not correctly map to the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`:** The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, which is not directly related to the periodic nature of the sequence. The correct approach should involve checking the periodicity of the sequence and deriving `k` based on the position `n` and the number `x`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Divisors:** The function `func_1` checks divisors of `q` and includes them in the list `M` if they meet the conditions. However, the logic for determining valid `k` values is flawed. The function should be checking the periodic sequence and determining `k` based on the position `n` and the number `x`.

4. **Incorrect Output:** The program outputs the length of the list `M` after removing duplicates, but this does not necessarily correspond to the correct number of possible `k` values.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the number of possible `k` values for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
