Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is a list containing integers where the first element is `w` (an integer greater than 1), the second-to-last element is `2` if `i >= x - 1`, and the last element is `q`; `i` is 2.**
