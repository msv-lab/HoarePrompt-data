Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is a list containing the integer `w` if `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list; a `TypeError` occurs because `math.sqrt` is called on a list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
    if q % i == 0:
        if i >= x - 1:
            M += [i]
        if q // i >= x - 1:
            M += [q // i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is a list containing integers where the first element is `w` (an integer greater than 1) and the last element is `q`. `i` is 1. If `q` modulo `i` is 0, and `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` includes `i` as the second-to-last element if `q // i` is also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing integers where the first element is `w` (an integer greater than 1). If `q % i == 0` and `i >= x - 1`, the second-to-last element of `M` is `2`, and the last element of `M` is `q`. If `q % i != 0` or `i < x - 1`, the second-to-last element of `M` remains unchanged, and the last element of `M` is `q`. `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples. `M` is a list containing integers where the first element is `w` (an integer greater than 1). If `q % i == 0` and `i >= x - 1`, the second element of `M` is set to 3 and `M` now contains an additional element `undefined`. If `q % i == 0` and `i < x - 1`, `M` remains unchanged except for the first element being `w`. If `q % i != 0`, `M` remains unchanged. `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
