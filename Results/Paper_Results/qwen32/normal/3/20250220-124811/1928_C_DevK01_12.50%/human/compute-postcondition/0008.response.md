The code snippet `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. The values of `q` and the conditions related to `q` remain unchanged. The value of `i` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is a list containing integers where the first element is `w` (an integer greater than 1) and the last element is `i`; `i` is 1, and `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. The current value of `q` modulo `i` is 0.**
