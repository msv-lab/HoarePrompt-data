To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze the logic and ensure that it correctly implements the problem's requirements.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the given pattern of "settling in".

The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions and follows the sequence:
\[ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \]

Given Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \), we need to find all \( k > 1 \) such that:
- The position \( n \) within the repeating sequence corresponds to the number \( x \).

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).

2. **Initial Check**:
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 because the pattern of settling requires an even number of positions to fit the sequence.

3. **Finding Possible \( k \)**:
   - It calls `func_1` with parameters \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it calls `func_1` again with parameters \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - It combines the results and removes duplicates by converting to a set.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds divisors of the given number \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It includes both the divisor and its complement (i.e., \( q // i \)) if it is also a valid divisor.

### Correctness Verification

- The program correctly handles the initial check for odd \( y \) because the pattern requires an even number of positions.
- The function `func_1` correctly finds divisors of a number that meet the criteria.
- The combination of results from `func_1` with different parameters ensures that all possible \( k \) are considered.
- The removal of duplicates ensures that each \( k \) is counted only once.

### Test Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: \( n = 10 \), \( x = 2 \)
   - Expected Output: 4
   - The program should correctly identify \( k = 2, 3, 5, 6 \).

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: \( n = 3 \), \( x = 1 \)
   - Expected Output: 1
   - The program should correctly identify \( k = 2 \).

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: \( n = 76 \), \( x = 4 \)
   - Expected Output: 9
   - The program should correctly identify the valid \( k \) values.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: \( n = 100 \), \( x = 99 \)
   - Expected Output: 0
   - The program should correctly identify that no valid \( k \) exists.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: \( n = 1000000000 \), \( x = 500000000 \)
   - Expected Output: 1
   - The program should correctly identify \( k = 1000000000 \).

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles edge cases, such as when \( y \) is odd, and correctly finds all possible \( k \) values that fit the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
