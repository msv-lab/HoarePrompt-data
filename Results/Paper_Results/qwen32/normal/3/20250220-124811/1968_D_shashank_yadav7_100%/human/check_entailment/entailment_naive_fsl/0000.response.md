Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The code initializes `bp` and `sp` to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, which is correct.
   - However, the loop incorrectly updates `bm` and `sm` with `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the cumulative scores over `k` turns.
   - The scores `bp` and `sp` should be updated by adding `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively in each turn, not multiplied by `k`.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop decrements `k` but does not correctly handle the case when `k` reaches 0. The loop should continue for exactly `k` turns.
   - The loop should update `bp` and `sp` by adding `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively in each turn.

3. **Indexing:**
   - The code correctly adjusts indices by subtracting 1 (`b -= 1` and `s -= 1`), but the logic for updating `b` and `s` within the loop is incorrect. It should be `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1` after updating the scores.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle cases where `P_B` or `P_S` might be in cycles within the permutation `p`. The game should run for exactly `k` turns, and the scores should be accumulated correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the code that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# Example usage
# func()
```

This corrected code properly simulates the game by running for exactly `k` turns and correctly accumulating the scores for both players.
