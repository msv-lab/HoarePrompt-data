Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and the arrays `p` and `a`.
   - It adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1 from them.

2. **Initial Scores**:
   - It initializes `sp` (Sasha's score) and `bp` (Bodya's score) with the values of `a[P_S]` and `a[P_B]`, respectively.
   - It also initializes `sm` (Sasha's maximum possible score) and `bm` (Bodya's maximum possible score) with the values of `a[P_S] * k` and `a[P_B] * k`, respectively. This is a mistake because it assumes that the best strategy is to stay in the same position for all `k` turns, which is not necessarily the case.

3. **Simulation of Moves**:
   - The program simulates the game for up to `k` turns.
   - In each iteration, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - It updates the scores `sp` and `bp` by adding the value of `a` at their new positions.
   - It updates `sm` and `bm` by considering the maximum possible score Bodya and Sasha can achieve by staying at their current positions for the remaining turns. However, the logic to update `sm` and `bm` is flawed. It should consider the maximum score achievable from the current position onwards, not just the current position multiplied by the remaining turns.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - After simulating the moves, the program compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.
   - It prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Scores**: The program incorrectly calculates `sm` and `bm` by multiplying the score of the current position by the remaining turns. This does not account for the possibility of moving to a position with a higher score in subsequent turns.
- **Inefficient Simulation**: The program simulates up to `k` turns, which can be inefficient for large `k` (up to \(10^9\)). It should consider cycles in the permutation to optimize the calculation.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha. It assumes that the best strategy is to stay in the same position for all turns, which is not necessarily true. Additionally, it does not handle large values of `k` efficiently.

**Correctness: False**
