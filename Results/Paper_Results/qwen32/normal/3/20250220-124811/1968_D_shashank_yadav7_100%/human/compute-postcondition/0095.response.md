The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but it does not provide any specific values for variables like `n`, `p`, `a`, or the result of the cumulative sums `sp` and `bp`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'Bodya'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Bodya**
