The code snippet provided is:

```python
sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
```

This line updates the value of `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 2
- `k` is -2
- `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`
- `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `sp` is `3 * a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1]`
- `bp` is `3 * a[b]`
- `bm` is `max(max(bp * k, a[b] * k + bp), a[b] * k + bp, a[b] * k + bp)`
- `sm` is `max(sp * k, a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] * k + sp, a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1] * k + sp)`

The value of `sm` is recalculated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`.

Since the exact values of `s`, `a`, `k`, and `sp` are not specified, we can only describe the updated `sm` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is -2, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(max(bp * k, a[b] * k + bp), a[b] * k + bp, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still greater than 0, `n` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 2, `k` is still -2, `s` remains `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `b` remains `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `p` and `a` are still lists of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is still `3 * a[p[p[s] - 1] - 1]`, `bp` is still `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is still `max(max(bp * k, a[b] * k + bp), a[b] * k + bp, a[b] * k + bp)`, and `sm` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`.
