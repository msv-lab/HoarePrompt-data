The code snippet `bp += a[b]` modifies the value of `bp` by adding `a[b]` to it. Therefore, the new value of `bp` will be the previous value of `bp` plus `a[b]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 3
- `s` is `p[previous_s] - 1`
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `sp` is `2 * a[s]`
- `bp` is `a[b]`
- If `k` equals 0, then `bm` is `a[b]`. Otherwise, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`
- `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`

After executing the code `bp += a[b]`, the value of `bp` changes.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 3; `s` is `p[previous_s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `2 * a[s]`; `bp` is `2 * a[b]`; If `k` equals 0, then `bm` is `a[b]`. Otherwise, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`; `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`.**
