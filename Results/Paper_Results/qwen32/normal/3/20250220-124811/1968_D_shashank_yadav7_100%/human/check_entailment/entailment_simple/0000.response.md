### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" between Bodya and Sasha based on the rules described. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the program's logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, which represent the length of the permutation, number of turns, and starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It then reads two lists: `p` (the permutation) and `a` (the array).

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program adjusts the starting positions of Bodya (`b`) and Sasha (`s`) by subtracting 1, converting them from 1-based to 0-based indexing.

3. **Initial Scores:**
   - It initializes the scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) with the values from the array `a` at their starting positions.
   - It also initializes `bm` and `sm` with the maximum potential scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively, assuming they stay in their starting positions for all `k` turns.

4. **Simulation of the Game:**
   - The program iterates up to `k` times, simulating each turn of the game.
   - In each iteration, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha according to the permutation `p` and adjusts their scores by adding the corresponding values from the array `a`.
   - During each iteration, it updates `bm` and `sm` to keep track of the maximum score Bodya and Sasha can achieve by either staying or moving.

5. **Determination of the Winner:**
   - After `k` turns, the program compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.
   - It prints "Bodya" if `bm` is greater, "Sasha" if `sm` is greater, and "Draw" if they are equal.

### Issues in the Program:

The logic described above seems correct for simulating the game and determining the winner. However, there are a few critical issues in the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Update of `bm` and `sm`:**
   - The lines `bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` incorrectly assume that the remaining turns `k` can be multiplied by the current position's value. This is not the correct approach to calculate the maximum score.
   - The correct approach should be to update the scores incrementally by adding the value at the current position in each turn.

2. **Redundant Multiplication by `k`:**
   - The multiplication by `k` in the above lines is incorrect and should be removed. The scores should be updated by adding the value at the current position in each turn.

3. **Logic for Maximum Score Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating `bm` and `sm` should be revised to correctly reflect the maximum score that Bodya and Sasha can achieve by either staying or moving at each turn.

### Corrected Approach:

To correct the program, the logic for updating `bm` and `sm` should be revised as follows:

- Initialize `bp` and `sp` with the values from the array `a` at their starting positions.
- Iterate up to `k` times, updating the positions and scores in each turn.
- Keep track of the maximum score for Bodya and Sasha by updating `bm` and `sm` correctly.

### Conclusion:

The current implementation of the program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
