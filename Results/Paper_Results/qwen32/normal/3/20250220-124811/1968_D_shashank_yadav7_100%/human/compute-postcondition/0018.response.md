Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true, otherwise `k` is decreased by 1; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `max(bp * k, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `sp * k`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The value of `bm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`bp * k`) and the new value (`a[b] * k + bp`). All other variables remain unchanged.
