The code snippet `bp += a[b]` modifies the value of `bp` by adding `a[b]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `bp` is `3 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `4 * a[b]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 4; `k` is -2; `i` is 4; `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `4 * a[s] - 1`; `bp` is `4 * a[b]`; `bm` is `max(a[b], a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `max(max(0, sp, a[s] * k + sp), a[s] - 1)`**
