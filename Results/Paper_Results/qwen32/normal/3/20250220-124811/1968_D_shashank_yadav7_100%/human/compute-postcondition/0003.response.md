The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list `p`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, and `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers obtained from input. However, the code snippet does not modify `t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, or `s`; it only introduces a new list `p`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are the four integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
