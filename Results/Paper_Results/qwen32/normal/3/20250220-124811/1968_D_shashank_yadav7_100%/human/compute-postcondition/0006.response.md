The value of `s` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `s` are the four integers obtained from the input, with `s` now being `s - 1`; `b` is the integer obtained from the input minus 1; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
