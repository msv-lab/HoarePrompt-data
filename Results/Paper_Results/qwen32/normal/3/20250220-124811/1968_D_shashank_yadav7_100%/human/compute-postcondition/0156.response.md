Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, a list `p` of `n` integers, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible values for Bodya and Sasha based on the given rules and prints "Bodya" if Bodya's value is greater, "Sasha" if Sasha's value is greater, or "Draw" if both values are equal.**
