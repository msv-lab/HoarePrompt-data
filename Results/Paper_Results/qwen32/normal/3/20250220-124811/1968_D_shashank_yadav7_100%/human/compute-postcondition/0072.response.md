The code snippet `bp += a[b]` modifies the value of `bp` by adding the value of `a[b]` to it. Given the initial state, `bp` is initially `a[b]`. After the operation, `bp` will be `a[b] + a[b]`, which is `2 * a[b]`.

Here is the updated output state:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0; `i` is 2; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `2 * a[s] - 1`; `bp` is `2 * a[b]`; `bm` is `a[b]`; `sm` is `max(0, sp)`**
