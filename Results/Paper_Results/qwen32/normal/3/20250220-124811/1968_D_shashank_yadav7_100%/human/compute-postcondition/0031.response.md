The code snippet `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Given the initial state, `bp` is initially `a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[b]`. After the increment, `bp` becomes `2 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[b]`.

The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is -1, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(max(bp * k, a[b] * k + bp), a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sp * k, a[s] * k + sp, a[s] * k + sp)`**
