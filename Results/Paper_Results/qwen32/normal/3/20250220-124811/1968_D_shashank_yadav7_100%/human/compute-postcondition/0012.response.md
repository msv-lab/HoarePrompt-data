Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `k`, `s`, and `b` are the integers obtained from the input, with `s` now being `s - 1` and `b` being `b - 1`; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is `a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b]`; `bm` is `bp * k`; `sm` is `sp * k`; `k` is decreased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables retain their initial state or calculated values as described.
