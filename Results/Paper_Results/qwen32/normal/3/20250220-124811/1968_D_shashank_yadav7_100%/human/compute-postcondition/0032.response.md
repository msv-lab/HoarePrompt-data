The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` is -1, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `max(max(bp * k, a[b] * k + bp), a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sp * k, a[s] * k + sp, a[s] * k + sp)`**
