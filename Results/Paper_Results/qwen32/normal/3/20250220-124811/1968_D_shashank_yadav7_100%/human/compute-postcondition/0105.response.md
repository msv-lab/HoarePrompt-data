The code snippet provided updates the list `p` by reading a new list of integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `s`, `b`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the input value; `k` is the input value; `i` is 3; `s` is the input value; `b` is the input value; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` over the number of iterations; `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` over the number of iterations; `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` over the iterations; `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` over the iterations; `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.**
