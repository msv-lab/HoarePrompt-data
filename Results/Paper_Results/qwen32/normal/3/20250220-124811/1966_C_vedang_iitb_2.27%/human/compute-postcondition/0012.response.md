Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile excluding the first pile, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a) - 1, and `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. Additionally, `winNext` is not equal to 2, and if `winNext` is equal to 1, then the first element of `a` is 1.**
