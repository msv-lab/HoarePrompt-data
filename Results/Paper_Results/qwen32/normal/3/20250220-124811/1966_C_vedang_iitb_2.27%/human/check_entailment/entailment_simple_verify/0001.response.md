### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the flaws in the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

#### Problem Analysis

The game described is a variant of the Nim game, where the winning strategy is determined by the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy. If it is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy, assuming both play optimally.

#### Program Analysis

**Function `func_1`**:
- The function removes duplicates, sorts the list, and computes the differences between consecutive elements.
- This transformation does not contribute to determining the game's winner based on the Nim-sum. The Nim-sum requires the original pile sizes, not their differences.

**Function `func_2`**:
- The function uses a recursive approach to determine the winner.
- The base cases and recursive logic are incorrect for determining the Nim-sum and the winner:
  - For `n == 1`, the function returns 1, which is correct since Alice wins if there's only one pile.
  - For `n == 2`, the function checks the parity of the first pile size, which is not universally correct. The correct logic should involve the Nim-sum.
  - The recursive logic does not correctly compute the Nim-sum or use it to determine the winner.

### Correct Implementation

A correct implementation should compute the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determine the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or non-zero. Here is a correct implementation:

```python
def determine_winner(piles):
    nim_sum = 0
    for pile in piles:
        nim_sum ^= pile
    return "Alice" if nim_sum != 0 else "Bob"

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    print(determine_winner(a))
```

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to incorrect logic in `func_2` and the irrelevant transformation in `func_1`. The original assessment accurately points out these issues.

### Final Answer

Final: **False**
