### Reasoning:

Let's break down the functions `func_1` and `func_2` and see if they collectively solve the problem as described.

#### Function `func_1`:
The function `func_1` takes a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, removes duplicates, sorts the list, and then modifies it such that each element (except the first) is the difference between its value and the previous element in the sorted list.

For example, if the input is `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the output will be `[3]` because all elements are the same and the difference between the same elements is 0, but we remove duplicates.

If the input is `[1, 3, 9, 7, 4, 2, 100]`, the sorted unique list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 100]`, and after computing differences, it becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 91]`.

#### Function `func_2`:
The function `func_2` is a recursive function that determines the winner based on the transformed list from `func_1` and the number of piles. It uses a strategy that seems related to the Nim game or Grundy numbers, but with some specific conditions.

- If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), the first player (Alice) wins.
- If there are two piles (`n == 2`), the first player wins if the sizes of the piles are not equal (since the second player can always mirror the first player's move if they are equal).
- For more piles, it recursively determines the winner for the remaining piles (`a[1:]`), and based on the result, it decides the winner for the current configuration.

However, the transformation done by `func_1` and the logic in `func_2` do not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for the game described. The game described is a variant of the Nim game where the key to winning is related to the XOR of the pile sizes, not the differences between sorted unique pile sizes.

The correct approach would be to compute the XOR of all pile sizes and determine the winner based on whether the XOR result is zero (Bob wins) or non-zero (Alice wins).

### Conclusion:
The given functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the described problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
