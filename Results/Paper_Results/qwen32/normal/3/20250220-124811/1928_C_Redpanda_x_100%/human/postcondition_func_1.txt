The function `generate` is a recursive generator that yields all possible products of the form \( p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{e_k} \), where \( p_i \) are prime numbers and \( e_i \) are non-negative integers up to a specified limit. The function takes a single parameter `k`, which indicates the current index in the list of primes, and it yields values based on the recursive generation of these products.
