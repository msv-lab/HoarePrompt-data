Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, and `k` is not equal to the length of the list primes; `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)`. `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`.
Code of the loop:
for factor in rest:
    prime_to_i = 1
    for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
        yield factor * prime_to_i
        prime_to_i *= prime


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, and `k` is not equal to the length of the list primes; `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty list; `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`; `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime`; `factors[prime]` is 1; a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, and `k` is not equal to the length of the list primes; `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty list with at least one more element; `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`; `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime * prime * ... * prime` (`prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`); `factors[prime]` is 1; a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded `factors[prime] + 1` times; `factor` is the next element in the `rest` list; a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been returned. The loop has finished executing all iterations.`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is an empty list, `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime`, `factors[prime]` is 0, a value has been returned.

In natural language, the final output state is:
- The loop has finished executing after yielding values for `factors[prime] + 1` iterations.
- `prime_to_i` is now `prime * prime` because it was multiplied by `prime` twice.
- `factors[prime]` is 0, indicating that the loop has completed its required iterations.
- All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state or as described in the output states after each iteration.

Output State:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
