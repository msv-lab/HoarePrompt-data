Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, and `k` is not equal to the length of the list primes; `rest` is an empty list; `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`; `prime_to_i` is `prime_to_i * prime`; `factors[prime]` is 1; a value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded `factors[prime] + 2` times; `factor` is undefined as the loop has finished executing; a value has been returned.**

In simple terms, `prime_to_i` has been updated to its previous value multiplied by `prime`. All other variables retain their initial values as described.
