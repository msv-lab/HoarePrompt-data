The code snippet provided is `prime_to_i *= prime`. This means the current value of `prime_to_i` is multiplied by the value of `prime`, and the result is assigned back to `prime_to_i`. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is a non-negative integer
- `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line
- `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n
- `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`
- `rest` is an empty list
- `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`
- `prime_to_i` is `prime_to_i * prime`
- `factors[prime]` is 0
- A value has been returned (this likely means the function or block of code has completed and is not affected by this operation)

After executing `prime_to_i *= prime`, the value of `prime_to_i` changes. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer representing Vasya's position in the line, `x` is a positive integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling such that 1 <= x < n, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is an empty list, `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is `prime_to_i * prime`, `factors[prime]` is 0, a value has been returned.**
