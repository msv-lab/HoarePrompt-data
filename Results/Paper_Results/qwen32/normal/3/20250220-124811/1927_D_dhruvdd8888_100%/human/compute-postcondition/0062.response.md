The code snippet `eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` updates the value of `eli` to the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the sorted list `arr` to maintain the order.

Output State: **`N` remains the same as the initial length of the array `a`; `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes; `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`; `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`; `num` is `nums[N]`, which is `-1`; `arr` contains tuples representing the segments of `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are the new values from the input; `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr`.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `eli` is now the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to keep `arr` sorted. All other variables remain unchanged.
