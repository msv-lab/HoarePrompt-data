Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an array of integers and a series of queries. Each query specifies a range within the array. The function then determines and prints a specific pair of indices for each query based on the segments of identical numbers in the array. If no valid pair can be found, it prints `-1 -1`.**
