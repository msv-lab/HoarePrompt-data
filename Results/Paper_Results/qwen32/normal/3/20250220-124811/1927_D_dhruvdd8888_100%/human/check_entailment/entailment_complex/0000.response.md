### Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem by identifying segments of identical numbers in the array and then using these segments to answer each query efficiently. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach and its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the array and the number of queries.
2. **Segmentation**: It creates an array `arr` that contains tuples representing segments of identical numbers in the input array `nums`. Each tuple `(s, e, num)` indicates a segment starting at index `s`, ending at index `e`, and containing the number `num`.
3. **Query Processing**: For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or just after the left boundary of the query. It then checks the segment to determine if a valid pair of indices can be found within the query range.

### Issues in the Program:
The logic for determining the pair of indices `(i, j)` within the query range `[l, r]` seems flawed. Specifically, the conditions for printing indices and handling edge cases are not correctly implemented. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Handling Segments**:
   - The program checks if the segment starts after `l` or ends before `r` but the logic for printing indices is incorrect.
   - If the segment starts after `l`, it should check if there is a previous segment that ends before `l` and print indices from that segment.
   - If the segment ends before `r`, it should check if there is a next segment that starts after `r` and print indices from that segment.
   - If the segment spans the entire range `[l, r]`, it should check if there are at least two different segments within the range.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the segment starts after `l` and there is no previous segment, it should print `-1 -1`.
   - If the segment ends before `r` and there is no next segment, it should print `-1 -1`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic for determining the pair of indices, the program is not correct as it does not handle all cases correctly.

**Correctness: False**

The program needs to be corrected to properly handle the segments and determine valid pairs of indices for each query.
