The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `arr`. No other variables are modified in the provided code. Therefore, the values of `N`, `a`, `q`, the queries, `nums`, `s`, `e`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the array `a` for the current test case; `a`, `q`, and the queries are yet to be read; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is an empty list.**
