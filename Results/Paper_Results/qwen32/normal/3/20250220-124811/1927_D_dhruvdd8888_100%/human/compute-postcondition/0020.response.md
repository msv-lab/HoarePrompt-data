The code appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple contains the values `(1 + s, i, num)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, `s` is either 0 or 1, and `num` is `nums[1]`. After the code execution, `arr` will have an additional tuple appended to it.

If `s` is 0, the tuple `(1 + 0, 2, nums[1])` or `(1, 2, nums[1])` is appended.
If `s` is 1, the tuple `(1 + 1, 2, nums[1])` or `(2, 2, nums[1])` is appended.

The values of `N`, `i`, `s`, `num`, and the initial contents of `arr` remain unchanged except for the new tuple added to `arr`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer that must be at least 0, `i` is 2, `s` is either 0 or 1, `num` is `nums[1]`, `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, nums[0])` if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, and an additional tuple `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])` is appended to `arr`. If `nums[i]` is equal to `num`, then `s` remains 0 and `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, nums[0])` and an additional tuple `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])`.**
