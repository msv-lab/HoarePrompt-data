The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1, -1`. This output is independent of the values of the variables `N`, `i`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, and `eli` as described in the initial state. The `print` statement explicitly specifies the values to be printed.

Here is a step-by-step explanation:

1. The `print(-1, -1)` statement directly specifies the values to be printed.
2. No computation or variable substitution is involved in this print statement.
3. The values `-1` and `-1` are explicitly hard-coded and will be printed as they are.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **-1, -1**
