The given `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`. This statement directly prints the values `-1` and `-1`, separated by a space. The values `-1` and `-1` are explicitly provided in the print statement and do not depend on any variables or objects described in the initial state. Therefore, the output is straightforward.

Output: **-1, -1**
