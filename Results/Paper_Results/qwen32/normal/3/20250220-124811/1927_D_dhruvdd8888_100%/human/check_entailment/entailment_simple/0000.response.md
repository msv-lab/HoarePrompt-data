Let's analyze the given program and verify if it correctly solves the problem based on the provided problem description and the annotated states.

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, where for each test case, it processes an array and a series of queries. Each query asks for two indices within a specified range such that the elements at those indices are different.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array elements, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves.

2. **Segmenting the Array:**
   - The program segments the array into contiguous segments where each segment consists of identical elements.
   - It uses a list `arr` to store tuples of the form `(start_index, end_index, value)`, representing the start and end indices of each segment and the value of the elements in that segment.

3. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or after the left boundary of the query.
   - It then checks the conditions to determine if a valid pair of indices exists within the specified range:
     - If the start of the found segment is greater than the left boundary and within the range, it checks if the previous segment can form a valid pair.
     - If the end of the found segment is within the range, it checks if the next segment can form a valid pair.
     - If no valid pair is found, it outputs `-1 -1`.

Let's verify the correctness of the program using the provided example:

### Example Verification

#### Test Case 1:
Input:
```
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```
Output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

- For the first query `(1, 5)`, the segment array `arr` will be `[(1, 2, 1), (3, 3, 2), (4, 5, 1)]`. The query will find the segment `(1, 2, 1)`, and since the next segment `(3, 3, 2)` starts within the range, it outputs `2 3`.
- For the second query `(1, 2)`, the only segment in the range is `(1, 2, 1)`, so no pair exists, and it outputs `-1 -1`.
- For the third query `(1, 3)`, the segment `(1, 2, 1)` is followed by `(3, 3, 2)`, which forms a valid pair, so it outputs `1 3`.

#### Test Case 2:
Input:
```
6
30 20 20 10 10 20
5
1 2
2 3
2 4
2 6
3 5
```
Output:
```
2 1
-1 -1
4 2
4 6
5 3
```

- For the first query `(1, 2)`, the segments are `(1, 1, 30)` and `(2, 3, 20)`. The query finds `(1, 1, 30)`, and the next segment `(2, 3, 20)` forms a valid pair, so it outputs `2 1`.
- For the second query `(2, 3)`, the segments are `(2, 3, 20)`. No valid pair exists within the range, so it outputs `-1 -1`.
- For the third query `(2, 4)`, the segments are `(2, 3, 20)` and `(4, 5, 10)`. The next segment `(4, 5, 10)` forms a valid pair, so it outputs `4 2`.
- For the fourth query `(2, 6)`, the segments are `(2, 3, 20)`, `(4, 5, 10)`, and `(6, 6, 20)`. The next segment `(4, 5, 10)` forms a valid pair, so it outputs `4 6`.
- For the fifth query `(3, 5)`, the segments are `(2, 3, 20)` and `(4, 5, 10)`. The next segment `(4, 5, 10)` forms a valid pair, so it outputs `5 3`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the test cases provided in the example. It segments the array into contiguous segments of identical elements and uses binary search to efficiently find valid pairs of indices for each query.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Reasoning: The program correctly segments the array into contiguous segments of identical elements and uses binary search to efficiently find valid pairs of indices for each query, matching the expected output for the provided examples.
Correctness: **True**
