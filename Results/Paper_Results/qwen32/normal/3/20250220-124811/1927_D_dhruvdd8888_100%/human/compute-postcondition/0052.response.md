To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and deduce the values of `s` and `s - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `arr`**:
   - `arr` contains tuples representing the segments of `nums`.
   - Each tuple in `arr` is of the form `(value, start_index, end_index)`.

2. **Understanding `LA`**:
   - `LA` is the last index of `arr`, i.e., `LA = len(arr) - 1`.

3. **Understanding `eli`**:
   - `eli` is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr` to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.

4. **Understanding `s` and `e`**:
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

5. **Determining `min(eli, LA)`**:
   - Since `eli` is the insertion index for `(l, 0, 0)`, it can be any index from 0 to `LA` (inclusive).
   - `min(eli, LA)` ensures that the index is within the bounds of `arr`.

6. **Determining `s`**:
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - This means `s` is the value of the segment at the determined index.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- The value of `s - 1` is simply `s` minus 1.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
