The code snippet provided updates the value of `num` to `nums[i]`. Given the initial state, `num` was initially `nums[1]`, and now it is updated to `nums[i]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged unless the new value of `num` affects the conditions involving `s` and `arr`.

Since `i` is 2, `num` is now `nums[2]`. The value of `s` and the contents of `arr` depend on whether `nums[2]` is equal to `nums[1]` or not. However, the code snippet itself only updates `num`, so the conditions for `s` and `arr` are not evaluated or changed by this specific line.

Output State: **`N` is an integer that must be at least 0, `i` is 2, `s` is either 0 or 2, `num` is `nums[2]`, and `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, nums[0])`. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `s` is 2 and an additional tuple `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])` is appended to `arr`. If `nums[i]` is equal to `num`, then `s` remains 0 and `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, nums[0])` and an additional tuple `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])`.**
