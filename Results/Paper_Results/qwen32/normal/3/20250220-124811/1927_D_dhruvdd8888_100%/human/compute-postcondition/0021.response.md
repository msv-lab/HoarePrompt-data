The code snippet `s = i` assigns the value of `i` to `s`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2. Therefore, after executing the code, `s` will be 2. The values of `N`, `num`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is an integer that must be at least 0, `i` is 2, `s` is 2, `num` is `nums[1]`, `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, nums[0])` if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, and an additional tuple `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])` is appended to `arr`. If `nums[i]` is equal to `num`, then `s` remains 0 and `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, nums[0])` and an additional tuple `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])`.**
