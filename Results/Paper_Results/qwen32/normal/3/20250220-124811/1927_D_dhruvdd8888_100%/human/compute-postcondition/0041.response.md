Let's break down the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved in the `print` statement.

1. **Variables and their relationships:**
   - `N` is the initial length of the array `a`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of `nums`.
   - `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one (`LA = len(arr) - 1`).
   - `l` and `r` are two integers from the input.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `num` is `nums[N]`, which is `-1`.
   - `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes.

2. **Conditions:**
   - `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
   - `e` is less than `r`.
   - `e` is less than `N` or `e` is less than `l`.

3. **What is printed:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(s, e + 1)`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e + 1` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` plus one.

Given the conditions and the relationships, we can determine the output as follows:

- `s` is the starting point of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
- `e + 1` is the endpoint of the segment in `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)` plus one.

Since the exact values of `arr`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `s` and `e`. However, we can describe the output based on the structure of the problem.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`)**
