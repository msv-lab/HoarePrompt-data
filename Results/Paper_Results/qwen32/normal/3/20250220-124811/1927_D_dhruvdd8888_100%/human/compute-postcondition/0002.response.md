The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. This means that `nums` will be a list of integers derived from the input.

Given the initial state, `N` is an integer representing the length of the array `a` for the current test case. However, the code snippet does not directly use `N` but instead reads a new list of integers into `nums`. The variables `a`, `q`, and the queries remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the array `a` for the current test case; `a`, `q`, and the queries are yet to be read; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.**
