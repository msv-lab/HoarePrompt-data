Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the array `a` for the current test case; `a`, `q`, and the queries are yet to be read; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional `-1` appended; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is an empty list.**

The list `nums` now includes an additional element `-1` appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
