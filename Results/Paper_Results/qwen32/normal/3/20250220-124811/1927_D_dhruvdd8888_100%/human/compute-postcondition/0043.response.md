The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs two values, `-1` and `-1`. The initial state and the variables described do not influence the values being printed in this specific `print` statement. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output `-1, -1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State and Variables**:
   - `N` is the initial length of the array `a`.
   - `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes.
   - `s` will be the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` will be the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `num` will be `nums[N]`, which is `-1`.
   - `arr` will contain tuples representing the segments of `nums`.
   - `LA` will be `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `l` and `r` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr`.
   - `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
   - `e` is greater than or equal to `l` and `e` is greater than or equal to `N`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(-1, -1)` statement directly outputs the values `-1` and `-1`, irrespective of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1, -1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
