Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `i` is `k+2`. However, `k` is not defined in the initial state, so we can ignore `i` for the purpose of this task since it is not used in the print statement.
- If `n` is equal to 3, the state remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `j` is set to `n + 1`. Again, `j` is not used in the print statement.

The code snippet:
```python
print('1 2')
```

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'1 2'`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` do not affect the output because they are not used in the `print` statement.

Output: **1 2**
