Let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state step by step.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `n` is an integer where \(n > 3\).
- `j` is 4.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

We need to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The variable `j` is explicitly given the value 4.
2. The `print` statement converts `j` to a string using `str(j)`, which will result in the string "4".
3. The `print` statement then concatenates two string representations of `j` with a space in between, resulting in the string "4 4".

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string "4 4".

Output: **4 4**
