The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

The initial state provided is that `n` must be at least 4. However, the variable `j` is not mentioned in the initial state. This means that the value of `j` is not explicitly provided or defined in the initial state. Since the value of `j` is not known, we cannot determine an exact numerical value to print.

However, we can describe the output in terms of `j`. The print statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and then the string representation of `j` again. Therefore, the output will be `j j`.

Output: **j j (where j is the value of the variable j)**
