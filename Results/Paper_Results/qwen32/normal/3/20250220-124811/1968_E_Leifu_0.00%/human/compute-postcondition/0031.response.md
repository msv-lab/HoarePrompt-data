The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is used in the `range(t)` function. This means that only `i` can be adjusted to move to the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k+1`. Since the loop iterates over `i` in the range of `t`, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be `k+2`.

The other variables `t`, `n`, and `j` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted based on the loop iteration. Specifically:
- `t` remains the same as it defines the total number of iterations.
- `n` remains the same as it is not part of the loop control.
- `j` remains the same or is set based on the condition `if n == 3`, but this does not affect the loop control.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is the integer input; `i` is `k+2`. If `n` is equal to 3, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `j` is set to `n + 1`.**
