Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `i` is set to `k+2`. However, `k` is not defined in the initial state, so we can ignore this for the purpose of determining the print statement's output.
4. If `n` is equal to 3, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `j` is set to `n + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 1')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement directly prints the string `'1 1'`. 
- It does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `i`, or `j` as it is a static string.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'1 1'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, or `j`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 1**
