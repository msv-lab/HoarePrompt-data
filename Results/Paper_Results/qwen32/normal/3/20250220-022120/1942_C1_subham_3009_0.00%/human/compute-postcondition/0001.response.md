Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ min(`n`, 2 · 10^5); `y` is 0; the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen; the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; the program is executing within the main module, indicated by the condition `__name__ == '__main__'`.**

In simple terms, `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input by the user, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
