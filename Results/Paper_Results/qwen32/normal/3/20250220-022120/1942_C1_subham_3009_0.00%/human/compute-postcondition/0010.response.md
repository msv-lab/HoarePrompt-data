The provided code snippet reassigns the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` with new values from the input. The initial state of `n`, `x`, and `y` is overridden. The value of `t` is not affected by this code snippet, and `arr` remains unchanged as well.

Given the initial state and the code, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

However, to be more specific about the changes:
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the first, second, and third integers from the new input, respectively.

So, the updated description in natural language is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third integers from the new input, respectively, `arr` is a list of integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
