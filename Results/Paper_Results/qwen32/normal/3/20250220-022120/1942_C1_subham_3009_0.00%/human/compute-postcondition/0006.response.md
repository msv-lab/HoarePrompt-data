The code snippet converts the elements of the list `arr` from strings to integers. Therefore, the elements of `arr` will now be integers instead of substrings.

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `arr` is a list of substrings from the second line of input, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

After the code execution, `arr` will contain integers.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
