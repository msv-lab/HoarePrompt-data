To determine the output, we need to focus on the variable `x` as it is the only variable directly used in the `print` statement. The initial state describes `x` as an integer from the new input.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print(x - 2)
```
We need to compute the value of `x - 2` based on the information provided. The exact value of `x` is not explicitly given in the initial state, but we know it is an integer.

Therefore, the output will be the result of subtracting 2 from the integer value of `x`.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is an integer from the new input)**
