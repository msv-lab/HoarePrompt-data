The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is at least 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers from new input, and `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers and the remaining elements are strings. After executing the code snippet, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the integers provided in the input, while `t` and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the integers from the new input, `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers and the remaining elements are strings.**
