The code snippet provided takes an input, splits it into parts, and assigns the result to the variable `arr`. This means `arr` will now hold a list of strings, each representing a part of the input.

Given that `arr` was initially a list where the first `x` elements were integers and the remaining elements were strings, after executing the code, `arr` will be completely replaced with the new input split into strings. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet. The variable `t` remains at least 0, as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers from the new input, `arr` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input.**
