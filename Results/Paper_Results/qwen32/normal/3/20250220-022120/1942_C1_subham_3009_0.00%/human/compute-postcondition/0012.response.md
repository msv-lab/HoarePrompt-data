The code snippet converts the first `x` elements of the list `arr` from strings to integers.

Given:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third integers from the new input, respectively
- `arr` is a list of strings from the new input split by whitespace

After the code execution:
- The first `x` elements of `arr` are now integers instead of strings.

Since the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the remaining elements of `arr` are not modified by the code, they retain their initial values. The only change is that the first `x` elements of `arr` are now integers.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third integers from the new input, respectively, `arr` is a list where the first `x` elements are integers and the remaining elements are strings.**
