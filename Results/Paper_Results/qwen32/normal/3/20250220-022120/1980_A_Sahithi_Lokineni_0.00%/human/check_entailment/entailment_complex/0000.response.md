Reasoning:  
The provided program is not correctly implementing the logic to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Default Value Function**: The code references a `default_value` function that is not defined anywhere in the provided code snippet. This function is supposed to provide a default value for the `defaultdict`, but its absence will cause a `NameError`.

2. **Logic for Counting Problems**: The logic used to determine the number of additional problems needed is incorrect. The program is currently adding `m - d[val]` to `ans` for every difficulty level `val` where `d[val] <= m`. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the total number of problems needed across all difficulty levels, which should be `m * 7` (since each round needs one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G').

3. **Counting the Deficit**: The correct approach would be to count how many problems of each difficulty level are needed to fulfill `m` rounds and then sum up the deficits for each level.

Here's a corrected version of the logic:
- For each difficulty level, calculate the number of problems needed, which is `m`.
- Calculate the deficit for each difficulty level as `m - d[val]` if `d[val] < m`, otherwise the deficit is `0`.
- Sum up the deficits for all difficulty levels to get the total number of additional problems needed.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
