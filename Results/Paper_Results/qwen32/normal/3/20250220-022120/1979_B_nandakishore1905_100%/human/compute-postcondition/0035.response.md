To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).
- `i` is the current iteration number + 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(k)
```

### Explanation:
The variable `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The absolute difference between two numbers \( n \) and \( m \) is calculated as \( |n - m| \).

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of `n` and `m`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
