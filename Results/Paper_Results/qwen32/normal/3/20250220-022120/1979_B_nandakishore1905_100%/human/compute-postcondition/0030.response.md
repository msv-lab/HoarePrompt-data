Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and is not a power of 2. If `k` is odd, then no additional changes are made to `k`. If `k` is even, then `k` is set to 8, `l` is set to '11', `p` is set to 2, `q` is set to 2, and `f` is set to 1.**
