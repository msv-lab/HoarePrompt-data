Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y`. It then calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints a value based on whether this difference is a power of 2, odd, or even and not a power of 2. Specifically, if the difference is a power of 2, it prints the difference. If the difference is odd, it prints 1. If the difference is even and not a power of 2, it prints the largest power of 2 less than the difference.**
