The code snippet `p = len(l)` assigns the length of the string `l` to the variable `p`. Given that `l` is '11', the length of `l` is 2. Therefore, `p` is updated to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9; `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input; `k` is 8; `k` is even and not a power of 2; `l` is '11'; `p` is 2; `q` is 4; `f` is 3**.
