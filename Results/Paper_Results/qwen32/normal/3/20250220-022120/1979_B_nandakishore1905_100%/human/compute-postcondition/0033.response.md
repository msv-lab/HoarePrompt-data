The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state of `t` and `i` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `i` remains the current iteration number + 1. The new variables `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is the current iteration number + 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
