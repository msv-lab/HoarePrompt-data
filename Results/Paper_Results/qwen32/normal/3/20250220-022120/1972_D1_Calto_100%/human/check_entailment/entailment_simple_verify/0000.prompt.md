You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. Since `b` is 0, the GCD is the value of `a`.

    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`; `x` is `n - (m * m - m)`; `y` is `m * m`.
    return cnt
    #The program returns `cnt`, which is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description.

**Problem Description:**
Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following conditions:
- 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
- a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

**Program:**
```python
import math

# Function 1: Compute GCD
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

# Function 2: Compute the number of valid pairs
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt
```

### Analysis:

1. **GCD Function (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

2. **Counting Valid Pairs (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The logic in `func_2` seems incorrect. The formula used within the loop does not correctly represent the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Issues in `func_2`:
- The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not align with the problem's condition. It seems like the author has attempted to simplify the problem in a way that is not accurate.
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`, but the values of `x` and `y` do not correctly represent the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `gcd(a, b)`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Example usage:
# n, m = 10, 8
# print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))  # Output should be 14
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to count the valid pairs correctly for all cases.

**Correctness: False**

Explanation: The provided program uses an incorrect formula and logic to count the valid pairs. It does not accurately check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for all possible pairs (a, b).
