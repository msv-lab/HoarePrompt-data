The code snippet assigns the value of `n - (i * i - i)` to the variable `x`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6, and `cnt` is -1. The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown. However, for the purpose of the output state, we will express `x` in terms of `n` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is -1; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` and `m` remain positive integers within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6, `cnt` remains -1, and `x` is calculated as `n - (i * i - i)`, where `i` is an unknown positive integer.
