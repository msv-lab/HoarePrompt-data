Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by defining two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. However, `func_1` is correctly calculating the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, which is not utilized in the provided `func_2`. The main logic of the solution lies in `func_2`.

The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n
2. 1 ≤ b ≤ m
3. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The provided `func_2` function seems to be implementing a different logic. The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`, calculates `x` as `n - (i * i - i)`, and `y` as `i * i`. It then increments `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

However, this logic does not directly correspond to the problem statement. The provided `func_2` does not check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for each pair (a, b). Instead, it seems to be counting based on a different derived formula which is not explained or justified in the problem statement or the comments.

Given the problem's requirement and the provided function's logic, it is clear that `func_2` does not correctly implement the required solution.

Correctness: **False**
