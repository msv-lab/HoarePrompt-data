Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a logic error in the function `func_2(n, m)`. The function is supposed to count the number of valid ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions, but the current implementation does not correctly address the problem.

The main issue lies in the incorrect logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs. The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not correctly translated into the loop and calculations within `func_2`.

Here's a brief outline of what the program needs to do to be correct:

1. For each test case, iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each `b`, iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`.
3. Check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
4. Count the number of pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition.

However, the given program does not follow this logic and instead uses a different calculation that does not correctly count the valid pairs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
