The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `x` based on the current values of `n` and `i`. The specific value of `x` is calculated as `n - (i * i - i)`. The precondition states that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6, and `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. Since `m` is not used in the code snippet, its value remains unchanged. The value of `n` also remains unchanged, but `x` is updated.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`.**
