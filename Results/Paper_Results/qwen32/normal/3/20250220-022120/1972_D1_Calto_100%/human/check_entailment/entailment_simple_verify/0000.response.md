### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not accurately implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function `func_1`:** This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - **Function `func_2`:** This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). However, the logic used in this function is incorrect.
     - The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not align with the problem's condition.
     - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`, but the values of `x` and `y` do not correctly represent the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations describe the state of the program at key points but do not challenge the incorrect logic used in `func_2`.
   - The annotations confirm that `func_1` correctly computes the GCD, but they do not provide insight into why `func_2` is incorrect.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done using nested loops, as shown in the correct implementation provided in the original assessment.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to count the valid pairs correctly for all cases.

**Final: False**

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program is incorrect. Therefore, we maintain the original assessment.

**Final: False**
