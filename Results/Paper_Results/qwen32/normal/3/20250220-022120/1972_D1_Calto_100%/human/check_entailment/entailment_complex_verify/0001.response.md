### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the reasoning further:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We need to find the number of pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2(n, m)`: This function attempts to count the number of valid pairs but uses a logic that does not match the problem's conditions.
     - The function initializes `cnt` to \(-1\), which is incorrect since the count should start from 0.
     - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\), and for each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) and \(y\) and updates `cnt` based on these values. However, this logic does not directly check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The provided correct implementation outline in the original assessment correctly counts the valid pairs.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, confirming the incorrect logic in `func_2(n, m)`.
   - The annotations do not challenge the original assessment but rather support it by showing that the logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the problem's conditions.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem based on the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
