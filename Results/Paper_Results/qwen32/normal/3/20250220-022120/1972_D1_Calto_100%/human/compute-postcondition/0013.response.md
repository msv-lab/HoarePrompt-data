To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the variables `cnt`, `x`, and `y` evolve with each iteration of the loop. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m`, and for each iteration, it updates `cnt` based on the current values of `n` and `i`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `cnt` starts at -1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `m`:
     - Calculate `x = n - (i * i - i)`.
     - Calculate `y = i * i`.
     - Update `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop completes, `cnt` will have accumulated the sum of `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` for each `i` from 1 to `m`.
   - The values of `x` and `y` are dependent on the last iteration (`i = m`), so `x` will be `n - (m * m - m)` and `y` will be `m * m`.

The final output state can be described as follows:

- `n` and `m` remain the same as they were initially.
- `cnt` is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`.
- `x` and `y` reflect the values from the last iteration (`i = m`).

In the final state:
- `x` is `n - (m * m - m)`.
- `y` is `m * m`.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `cnt` is the sum of `math.ceil((n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)) + ((n - (i * i - i)) % (i * i) == 0)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`; `x` is `n - (m * m - m)`; `y` is `m * m`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `cnt` will be the accumulated result of the calculations for each `i` from 1 to `m`, and `x` and `y` will reflect the values from the last iteration of the loop.
