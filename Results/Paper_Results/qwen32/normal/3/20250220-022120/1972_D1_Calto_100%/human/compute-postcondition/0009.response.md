Let's break down the task step by step.

The given state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
- `cnt` is updated to a specific formula involving `n`, `i`, `x`, and `y`.
- `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`.
- `y` is `i * i`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

The `for` loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
1. **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
2. **`m`**: This value does not change throughout the loop.
3. **`n`**: This value also does not change throughout the loop.
4. **`cnt`**: While `cnt` is updated during the loop, its value at the start of the next iteration is not directly relevant to the loop condition (which depends on `i` and `m`). However, for completeness, we should note that `cnt` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration.

Given that the only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, and `i` has already been incremented, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**
