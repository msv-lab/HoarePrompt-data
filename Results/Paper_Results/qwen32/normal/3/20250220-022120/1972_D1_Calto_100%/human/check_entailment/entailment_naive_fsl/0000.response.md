Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description.

**Problem Description:**
Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following conditions:
- 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
- a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

**Program:**
```python
import math

# Function 1: Compute GCD
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

# Function 2: Compute the number of valid pairs
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt
```

### Analysis:

1. **GCD Function (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

2. **Counting Valid Pairs (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The logic in `func_2` seems incorrect. The formula used within the loop does not correctly represent the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Issues in `func_2`:
- The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not align with the problem's condition. It seems like the author has attempted to simplify the problem in a way that is not accurate.
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`, but the values of `x` and `y` do not correctly represent the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `gcd(a, b)`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Example usage:
# n, m = 10, 8
# print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))  # Output should be 14
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to count the valid pairs correctly for all cases.

**Correctness: False**

Explanation: The provided program uses an incorrect formula and logic to count the valid pairs. It does not accurately check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for all possible pairs (a, b).
