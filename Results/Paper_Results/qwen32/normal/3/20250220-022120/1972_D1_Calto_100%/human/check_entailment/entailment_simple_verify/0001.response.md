### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program is incorrect. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The problem requires finding ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
     - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. This part of the program is correct.

3. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The implementation initializes `cnt` to \(-1\), which is incorrect since the count should start from 0.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly reflect the problem's conditions. Specifically, it calculates \(x\) and \(y\) in a way that does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done using a nested loop where \(a\) ranges from 1 to \(n\) and \(b\) ranges from 1 to \(m\).

### Annotations Analysis:
- The annotations provided do not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the logic inside `func_2(n, m)` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The annotations state that `cnt` is the sum of a specific formula, but this formula does not correspond to the problem's conditions.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem based on the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Final: False**
