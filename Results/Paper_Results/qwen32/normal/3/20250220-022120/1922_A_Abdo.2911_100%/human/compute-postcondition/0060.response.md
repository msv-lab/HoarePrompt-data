The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, none of the variables `possible`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `a[i]` and `b[i]` are affected.

Output State: **`possible` is `False`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input value, `b` is the stripped input value, `c` is the stripped input value, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and the current value of `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.**
