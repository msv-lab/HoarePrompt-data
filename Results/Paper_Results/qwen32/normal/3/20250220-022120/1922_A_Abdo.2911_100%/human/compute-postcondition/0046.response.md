The loop head in the provided `for` loop statement is `for _ in range(t):`. This indicates that the loop will iterate `t` times, and the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body (hence the underscore).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of each iteration, `t` is implicitly decremented by 1.

Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to decrement `t` by 1.

State: **`possible` is a boolean, `t` is decremented by 1**
