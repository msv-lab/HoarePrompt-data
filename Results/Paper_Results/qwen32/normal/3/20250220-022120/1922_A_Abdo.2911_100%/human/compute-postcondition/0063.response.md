Output State: **`possible` is `True`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input value, `b` is the stripped input value, `c` is the stripped input value, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor equal to `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables `possible`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The condition that `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]` is still valid. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
