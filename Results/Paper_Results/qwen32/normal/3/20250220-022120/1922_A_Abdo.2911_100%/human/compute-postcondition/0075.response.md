The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `i` is incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so for the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 again from its current value. Since `n` is greater than `i + 1` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

To make it clear, if `i` was 3 at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4, and `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

State: **`possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is 4**. 

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as:

State: **`possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we adjust `i` to be `i + 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

To make it more precise in terms of the next iteration:

State: **`possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.

State: **`possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

To be more specific, if `i` was 3 at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4, and `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

State: **`possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is 4**.

However, generalizing it:

State: **`possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`possible` is determined by the condition, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
