The code snippet sets the variable `possible` to `True`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 2; `possible` is True.**
