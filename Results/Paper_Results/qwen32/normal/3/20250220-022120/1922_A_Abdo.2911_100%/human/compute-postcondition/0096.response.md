To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, as `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `possible` is False
- `t` is at least 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is the stripped input string
- `b` is the newly input and stripped string
- `c` is the newly input and stripped string

The variables `possible`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself and does not need to be set beforehand.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`possible` is False, `t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly input and stripped string, `c` is the newly input and stripped string**
