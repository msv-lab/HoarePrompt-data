The `print('YES')` statement in the given code snippet will output the string 'YES'. The initial state indicates that the variable `possible` is `True` and that `t` has been decremented by 1, but these variables are not used in the print statement. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are mentioned to remain unchanged, but they are also not used in the print statement.

The print statement directly outputs the string 'YES' without referencing any variables or conditions.

Output: **YES**
