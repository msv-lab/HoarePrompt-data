The code snippet assigns a new value to `b` by taking an input string and removing any leading and trailing whitespace. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**
