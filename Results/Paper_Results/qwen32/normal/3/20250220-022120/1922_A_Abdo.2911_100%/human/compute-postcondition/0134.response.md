Output State: **The loop will have executed `t` times, and for each execution, it will have printed either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified. `t` will be 0, and `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their most recently assigned values from the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished all its iterations (i.e., `t` times), the program will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. The variable `t` will be 0 because it has been decremented `t` times. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last test case processed by the loop.
