Output State: **`possible` is True, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the stripped input values, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `possible` remains True, `t` has been decremented by 1, `n` is still greater than `i + 1`, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the stripped input values. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
