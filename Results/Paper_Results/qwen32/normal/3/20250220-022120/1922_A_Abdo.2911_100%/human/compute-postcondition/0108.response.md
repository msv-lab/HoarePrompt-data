Postcondition: **`possible` is False if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is True. In both cases, `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the newly input and stripped string, `c` is the newly input and stripped string, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.**
