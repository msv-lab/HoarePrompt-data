Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `b` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 0; the character at index `i` of `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `b`. If the character at index `i` of `c` is equal to the character at index `i` of `a` or the character at index `i` of `b`, then `possible` remains False. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
