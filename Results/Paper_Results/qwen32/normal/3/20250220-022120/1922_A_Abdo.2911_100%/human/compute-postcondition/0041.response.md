Postcondition: **`possible` is `True`, meaning at some index `i`, one of the conditions that set `possible` to `True` was met, and the loop broke. The conditions for `possible` being `True` involve either `a[i]` not being equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` being equal to `a[i]`, or `c[i]` being equal to `b[i]`. If, after all iterations, `possible` remains `False`, it means that for every index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the conditions did not set `possible` to `True`. This can happen in two scenarios: for each index `i`, `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is also equal to `a[i]`; or for each index `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. However, in the current state, `possible` is `True`.**
