### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The program performs the following steps for each test case:
1. It reads the length of the strings `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. It initializes a boolean variable `possible` to `False`.
3. It iterates over each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
4. For each position `i`:
   - If the characters `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same:
     - It checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`. If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks the loop.
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different:
     - It checks if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If not, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks the loop.
5. After the loop, it prints "YES" if `possible` is `True`, otherwise it prints "NO".

The logic here is to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not. Here's how the conditions align with the problem requirements:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be an uppercase letter (since `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`). In this case, `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` to not match the template.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` can be either `a[i]` (uppercase) or `b[i]` (uppercase). In this case, `c[i]` must not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]` to not match the template.

The program correctly checks these conditions and determines if such a template exists.

### Correctness:
