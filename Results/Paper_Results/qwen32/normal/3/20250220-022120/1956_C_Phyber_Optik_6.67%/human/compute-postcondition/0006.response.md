Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is `i`, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to be equal to `i`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
