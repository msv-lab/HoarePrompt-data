The code snippet `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of the expression `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `i + 1`, `sum` is increased by `n * (n + 1) // 2`.**
