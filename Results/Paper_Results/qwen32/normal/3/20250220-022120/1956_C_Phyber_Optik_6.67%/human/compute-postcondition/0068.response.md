To determine what will be printed by the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State:
- `sum` is 110
- `r` is 1
- `n` is 5
- `t` is 1
- `j` is less than or equal to 5

Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we know the values of `sum`, `r`, `n`, and `t`, but the exact value of `j` is not specified other than the fact that it is less than or equal to 5. Since the code snippet only prints the values `1` and `j`, we can describe the output in terms of `j`.

The `print` statement will output the integer `1` followed by the value of `j`, with no newline character at the end due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **1 [j] (where j is an integer less than or equal to 5)**
