Reasoning: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than 2n operations. The correct strategy involves filling the matrix with the largest possible values, which can be achieved by using permutations that place the highest numbers in the matrix.

The current code attempts to calculate the sum and the number of operations but does not correctly describe the operations themselves. The logic for calculating the sum is flawed, and the operations described do not maximize the sum of the matrix.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The code calculates the sum incorrectly. It does not properly account for the maximum sum achievable by the matrix. The correct maximum sum for an n x n matrix is n * (n^2 + n) / 2, which is the sum of the first n^2 natural numbers. The current code sums up values in a way that does not reflect this.

2. **Operations**: The operations described in the code do not maximize the sum of the matrix. The code prints operations that fill rows and columns with permutations starting from 1 to n, but it does not ensure that the highest possible numbers are placed in the matrix.

3. **Number of Operations**: The code outputs the number of operations as `n + r`, where `r` is derived from a condition that does not logically follow the problem's requirements. The correct number of operations should be exactly 2n, as the problem guarantees that the maximum sum can be achieved with no more than 2n operations.

To correct the code, we need to:
- Calculate the correct maximum sum.
- Describe operations that fill the matrix with the highest possible numbers using exactly 2n operations.

A correct approach would be to fill the first n rows with permutations that start from the highest possible numbers and then fill the first n columns with the same permutations. This ensures that the matrix is filled with the largest possible values, maximizing the sum.

Correctness: **False**
