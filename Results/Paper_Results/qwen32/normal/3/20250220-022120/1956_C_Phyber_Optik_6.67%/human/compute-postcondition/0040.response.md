Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `sum` is 75
- `r` is 2
- `n` is 0
- `j` is 2

### Print Statement:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Argument (`2`)**: This is a literal integer value `2` and will be printed as is.
2. **Second Argument (`j % n`)**: This is a modulo operation between `j` and `n`. Given that `j` is 2 and `n` is 0, the operation `2 % 0` will result in a `ZeroDivisionError` because division by zero is undefined in mathematics and not allowed in Python.

Since the modulo operation (`j % n`) will raise an error, the print statement will not execute as intended, and an error will occur instead of printing the expected output.

However, if we were to strictly adhere to the requirement of describing the output based on the given information without considering the runtime error, we would describe it as follows:

- `j % n` would be an undefined value due to division by zero, but for the sake of explanation, we can say it would be an error if executed.

### Output Description:
Given the above analysis, the precise description of the output, considering the error, would be that an error will occur. However, if we are to strictly adhere to the format provided and describe the intended output before the error occurs:

Output: **2, [Error: division by zero]**

Since the task specifically asks for what will be printed and not the error handling, we should focus on the values that would be printed if the error did not occur. Thus, the intended output before the error would be:

Output: **2, [undefined due to division by zero]**

However, to strictly follow the problem's format and the given examples, the most precise description based on the precondition, without considering the runtime error, would be:

Output: **2, [undefined due to division by zero]**
