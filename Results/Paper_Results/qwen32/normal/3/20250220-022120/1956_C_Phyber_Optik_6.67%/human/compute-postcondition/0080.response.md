The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range `(1, n + r + 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 6, `n` is 5, and `r` is 1, which means the range is `(1, 7)`. Since `j` is currently 6, the loop will not execute again because `j` is not less than 7.

However, if we want to determine the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `j` to a value that is within the range but has not been iterated over yet. Since `j` was 6 at the end of the last iteration, the loop would have executed if `j` was 5. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we set `j` to 5.

State: **`sum` is 110, `r` is 1, `n` is 5, `t` is 1, and `j` is 5**
