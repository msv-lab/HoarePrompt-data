The value of `sum` is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it. Other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` is still valid after the code execution.

Output State: **`sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is `i`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 1, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**
