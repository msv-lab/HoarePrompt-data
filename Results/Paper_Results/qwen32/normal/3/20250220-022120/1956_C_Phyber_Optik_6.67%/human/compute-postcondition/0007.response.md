The code snippet increments the variable `sum` by the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Given that `sum` was initially 0, after the execution of the code, `sum` will be equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `r`, and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is `i`, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**
