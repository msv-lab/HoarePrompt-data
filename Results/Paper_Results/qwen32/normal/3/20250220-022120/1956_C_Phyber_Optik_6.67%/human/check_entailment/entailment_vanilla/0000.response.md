Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all the numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a limited number of operations. The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of numbers from 1 to n.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

3. It initializes `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0. The variable `sum` is supposed to hold the maximum sum of the matrix, and `r` is used to determine the number of additional operations needed beyond the `n` operations.

4. The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1)` calculates the sum by adding the maximum possible sum for each row or column. The maximum possible sum for a row or column is the sum of numbers from 1 to n, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The program adds this sum to `sum` for each row until the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is no longer true. After that, it adds `i * n` to `sum` for the remaining rows. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly calculate the maximum possible sum for the matrix. The correct approach would be to simply add `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each row, as the maximum sum for each row is always the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

5. The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is `n + r`. However, `r` is not correctly calculated to represent the number of additional operations needed. The correct number of operations should always be `2n` since we can fill all rows and all columns with permutations to maximize the sum.

6. The program then prints the operations. It prints `n` operations to fill each row with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` and `r` operations to fill each column with the same permutation. However, `r` is not correctly calculated, and the operations are not necessary to maximize the sum. The correct approach would be to print `n` operations to fill each row and `n` operations to fill each column.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum or the number of operations, and the operations printed are not necessary to maximize the sum.

Correctness: **False**
