In the given for loop, the loop head contains the variable `j` and the range function parameters `1`, `n + r + 1`. The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value, which means the stop value (`n + r + 1`) must be greater than the start value (`1`).

Given the state before the loop starts is `sum = 75` and `r = 2`, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. The variable `sum` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. The variable `n` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we need to introduce it and ensure that `n + r + 1` is greater than `1`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- `sum` remains 75.
- `r` is 2.
- `n` must be a value such that `n + r + 1` is greater than `1`. Since `r` is 2, `n + 2 + 1` must be greater than `1`, which simplifies to `n + 3 > 1` or `n > -2`. The smallest integer value for `n` that satisfies this condition is `0`.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`sum` is 75, `r` is 2, `n` is 0**
