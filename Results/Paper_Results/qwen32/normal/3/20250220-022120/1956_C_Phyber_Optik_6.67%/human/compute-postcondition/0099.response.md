Output State: **`sum` is either `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, or `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`; `r` is 4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `t` is 2; `j` is 8; `i` is 4.**

In simpler terms, the value of `sum` is increased by `n * (n + 1) // 2` regardless of the initial condition. The other variables (`r`, `n`, `t`, `j`, `i`) remain unchanged.
