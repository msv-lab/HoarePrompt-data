Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state provided.

Initial State:
- `sum` is 110 (though this variable is not used in the print statement)
- `r` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement)
- `n` is 5
- `t` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement)
- `j` is less than or equal to 5 (though this variable is not used in the print statement)

The print statement is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n + 1`. Given that `n` is 5, `n + 1` is 6, so the sequence generated by `range(1, 6)` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

The `*` operator before `range(1, n + 1)` unpacks this sequence so that each element is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function. Therefore, the output will be the numbers 1 through 5, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 4 5**
