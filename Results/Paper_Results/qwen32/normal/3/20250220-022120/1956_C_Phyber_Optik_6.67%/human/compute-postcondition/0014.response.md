The code snippet `sum += i * n` increments the variable `sum` by the product of `i` and `n`. The variables `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (which must be at least 1), and `i` (which is incremented by 1 in the initial state) are affected as follows:

- `sum` is updated to its current value plus the product of `i` and `n`.
- `i` is incremented by 1, but this increment is described in the initial state, so we only reflect the change in `sum`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `sum` is updated to its current value plus `i * n`.**
