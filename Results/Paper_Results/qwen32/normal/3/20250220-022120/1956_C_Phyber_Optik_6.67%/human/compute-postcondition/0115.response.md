The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Given that `n` is 5, the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate numbers from 1 to 5.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n + 1` (which is 6 in this case, but the range is exclusive of the stop value).
2. The `*` operator unpacks the range object so that each number is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.
3. The `print` function then prints these numbers separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be the numbers 1 through 5, each separated by a space.

Output: **1 2 3 4 5**
