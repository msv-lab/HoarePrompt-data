Let's break down the given Python code snippet and determine what will be printed based on the initial state provided.

The initial state provides the following values:
- `sum` is 90
- `r` is 2
- `n` is 5
- `t` is 2
- `j` is 4

The Python code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

We need to evaluate the expression `j % n`:
- `j` is 4
- `n` is 5

The modulus operator `%` calculates the remainder of the division of `j` by `n`. Therefore, `4 % 5` is 4 because 4 divided by 5 is 0 with a remainder of 4.

The `print` statement will output:
- The first argument is the integer `2`.
- The second argument is the result of `j % n`, which is `4`.
- The `end=' '` argument specifies that the print statement should end with a space instead of a newline.

Combining these, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **2 4 ** (where the last space is the result of `end=' '`)
