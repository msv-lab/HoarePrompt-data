The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which determines how many times the loop will execute. The variables `sum`, `r`, and `n` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted based on the loop's iteration logic.

Given that the loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must have been decremented by 1 if the loop has executed before. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`sum` is 75, `r` is 2, `n` is 0, `t` is 1**
