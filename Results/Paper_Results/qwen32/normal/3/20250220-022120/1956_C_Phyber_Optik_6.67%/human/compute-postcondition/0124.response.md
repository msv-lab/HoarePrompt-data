The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(1, j, end=' ')`. Based on the initial state provided, we know the values of the variables involved:

- `j` is 4
- The `end=' '` argument specifies that a space should be used at the end of the output instead of the default newline character.

The `print` statement will output the values `1` and `j` (which is `4`), separated by a space, and will end with another space instead of a newline.

Output: **1 4 ** (where the trailing space indicates the `end=' '` argument)
