Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues and does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the problems identified:

1. **Global Variables Usage**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without defining them within the functions or passing them as parameters. This can lead to undefined behavior and issues when the function is called multiple times (e.g., for different test cases).

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Clusters**:
   - The calculation of the number of cliques (`cliques = ceil(n / k)`) is incorrect. The number of cliques should be determined based on the constraints and the requirement that every pair of vertices (i, j) should be connected if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`. The current approach does not ensure this condition is met.

3. **Incorrect Assignment of Values**:
   - The `make_array` function assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` based on a simple arithmetic progression and does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` holds for all pairs within the same clique.

4. **Printing Inside Functions**:
   - The `func_1` function prints the results directly, which is not suitable for a function that should return values. This makes it difficult to handle multiple test cases and integrate the function into a larger program.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases, such as when `n` is very small or when `k` is very large or very small, ensuring that the conditions for forming cliques are met.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the input:
```
2
3 2
4 3
```

The program might output something like:
```
2 1 3
1
1 1 1
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```

This output is incorrect because:
- For `n=3` and `k=2`, it should be possible to form a single clique since the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= 2` can be satisfied with appropriate assignments of `a_i`.
- For `n=4` and `k=3`, the output does not ensure that all pairs within the same clique satisfy the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= 3`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
- Assign values to `a_i` such that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs within the same clique.
- Determine the minimum number of cliques required and ensure that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.
- Return the assignments, the number of cliques, and the partitioning of the graph into cliques.

Given the above issues, the provided program is incorrect.
