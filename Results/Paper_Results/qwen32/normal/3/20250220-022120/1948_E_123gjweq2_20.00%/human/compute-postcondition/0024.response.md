Functionality: **The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left` and `right`, which are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), and `clique`, which is an integer representing the clique number to which the vertices will be assigned. The function returns an array where the elements between indices `left` and `right` (inclusive) are assigned the value of `clique`.**
