The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 40 inclusive, and `k` is between 1 and 2n inclusive. It divides `n` into segments of length `k` (or less for the last segment) and fills each segment with consecutive integers starting from 1 up to the number of segments (`cliques`). The function prints three lists: the first list (`arr`) contains these filled segments with zeros in any remaining positions, the second list is the number of segments (`cliques`), and the third list (`cliquess`) is identical to the first list.
