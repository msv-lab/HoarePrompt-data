### Reasoning:

Let's carefully evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version. We will focus on the correctness of the program in terms of meeting the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Vertices and Edges Assignment**:
   - Assign distinct integers `a_i` from 1 to `n` to vertices `i`.
   - Add edges between vertices `(i, j)` if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.

2. **Clique Partitioning**:
   - Partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - Each vertex should belong to exactly one clique.
   - A clique is a set of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
- `func_1(n, k)`: This function calculates the number of cliques and assigns values to vertices and their respective cliques.
- `make_array(left, right, clique)`: This function fills in the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` for a specific range of vertices.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variables**:
   - The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are used inside `make_array` but are not defined as global variables. This will lead to an error since Python treats variables defined inside a function as local unless explicitly declared as global. However, in the annotated version, it seems these variables are defined in the global scope, so this issue might be resolved in the actual implementation.

2. **Clique Calculation**:
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`. This might not always be the optimal number of cliques for the given problem. The program does not attempt to find the minimum number of cliques; it simply divides the vertices into segments of length `k` and assigns a clique number to each segment.

3. **Array Filling**:
   - The `make_array` function fills the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` by assigning consecutive increasing and decreasing values to a segment of the array. However, it does not ensure that the values of `a_i` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The values assigned to `arr` are not guaranteed to satisfy the edge condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` but does not ensure that the graph formed is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

#### Verification Using Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program at key points. However, they do not address the key issues mentioned above, such as the distinctness of `a_i` and the satisfaction of the edge condition.
- The annotations show that the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are filled as expected, but they do not validate the correctness of the solution in terms of the problem requirements.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not ensure that the values assigned to vertices are distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and it does not guarantee that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not meet the problem requirements and does not provide a correct solution.
