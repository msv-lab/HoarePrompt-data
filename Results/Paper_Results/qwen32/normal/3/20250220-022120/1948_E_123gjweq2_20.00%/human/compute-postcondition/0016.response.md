The given code snippet assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the provided context, which means this code will not run as it is because `i` is a loop variable that is not initialized or provided a range. Given the context, let's assume the intention was to update all elements from `cliquess[left + mid]` to `cliquess[right]` with the value `clique`. 

Since the variable `i` is not specified, we will assume the code is part of a loop and `i` takes on values from `0` to `not_mid - 1`, as per the description of the initial state.

The impact of the code is that all elements in `cliquess` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will be set to `clique`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`, `clique` is an integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i` for `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `mid + not_mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`.**
