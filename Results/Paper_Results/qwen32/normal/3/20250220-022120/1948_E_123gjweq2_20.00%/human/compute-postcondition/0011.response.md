The provided code snippet assigns a value to `arr[left + i]`. Given the initial state, `arr[left + i]` is already defined as `small_element + i`. Reassigning it to `small_element + i` does not change its value. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr); `clique` is an integer; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`; `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`; `i` is `i + 1`**
