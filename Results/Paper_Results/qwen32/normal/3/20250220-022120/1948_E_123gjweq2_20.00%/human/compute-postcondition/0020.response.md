The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute `not_mid` times. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`, `clique` is an integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i` for `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `mid + not_mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid]` is `big_element`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for `i` from `1` to `not_mid - 1`, `i` is 1**
