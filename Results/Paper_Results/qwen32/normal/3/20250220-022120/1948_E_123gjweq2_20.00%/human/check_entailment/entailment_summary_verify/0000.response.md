### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided code and the function summaries to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Assign distinct integers to vertices and partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
- **Constraints**: 
  - `1 <= t <= 1600` (number of test cases).
  - `2 <= n <= 40` (number of vertices).
  - `1 <= k <= 2n` (given constraint).

#### Code Analysis:

1. **Global Variable Usage**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess`. This is problematic because it can lead to incorrect results if the function is called multiple times without resetting these variables. This violates the principle of encapsulation and can cause issues with multiple test cases.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Clusters**:
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `cliques = ceil(n / k)`. This is a heuristic and does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques. The actual number of cliques should be determined based on the connectivity condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.

3. **Incorrect Assignment of Values**:
   - The `make_array` function assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` in a specific manner but does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` holds for all pairs within the same clique. The function summary confirms that `make_array` assigns values but does not address the connectivity condition.

4. **Printing Inside Functions**:
   - The `func_1` function prints the results directly. This makes it challenging to handle multiple test cases and integrate the function into a larger program. It should return the results instead of printing them.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `k` is very large, it might be possible to form a single clique, but the current approach does not ensure this.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `make_array` modifies `arr` and `cliquess` by assigning consecutive increasing and decreasing integers and assigns a clique number to these elements. However, it does not ensure that the connectivity condition is met.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the program, including incorrect clique calculation, global variable usage, and incorrect assignment of values. The assessment also points out that the program does not handle edge cases properly.

#### Final Evaluation:
Given the identified issues, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and contains several logical and implementation flaws.

### Final: **False**
