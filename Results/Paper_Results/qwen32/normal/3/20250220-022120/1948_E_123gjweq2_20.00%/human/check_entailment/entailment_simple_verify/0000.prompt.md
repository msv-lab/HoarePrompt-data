You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues and does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the problems identified:

1. **Global Variables Usage**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `make_array` use global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without defining them within the functions or passing them as parameters. This can lead to undefined behavior and issues when the function is called multiple times (e.g., for different test cases).

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Clusters**:
   - The calculation of the number of cliques (`cliques = ceil(n / k)`) is incorrect. The number of cliques should be determined based on the constraints and the requirement that every pair of vertices (i, j) should be connected if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`. The current approach does not ensure this condition is met.

3. **Incorrect Assignment of Values**:
   - The `make_array` function assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` based on a simple arithmetic progression and does not ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` holds for all pairs within the same clique.

4. **Printing Inside Functions**:
   - The `func_1` function prints the results directly, which is not suitable for a function that should return values. This makes it difficult to handle multiple test cases and integrate the function into a larger program.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases, such as when `n` is very small or when `k` is very large or very small, ensuring that the conditions for forming cliques are met.

### Example of Incorrectness:

Consider the input:
```
2
3 2
4 3
```

The program might output something like:
```
2 1 3
1
1 1 1
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```

This output is incorrect because:
- For `n=3` and `k=2`, it should be possible to form a single clique since the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= 2` can be satisfied with appropriate assignments of `a_i`.
- For `n=4` and `k=3`, the output does not ensure that all pairs within the same clique satisfy the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= 3`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
- Assign values to `a_i` such that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs within the same clique.
- Determine the minimum number of cliques required and ensure that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.
- Return the assignments, the number of cliques, and the partitioning of the graph into cliques.

Given the above issues, the provided program is incorrect.
