The value of `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - mid`. Given `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, and `big_element` is `right + 1` and `small_element` is `left + 1`, we can substitute these values into the equation for `mid`:

\[ mid = \left(\frac{(right + 1) - (left + 1)}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{right - left}{2}\right) \]

Now, substituting `mid` into the equation for `not_mid`:

\[ not\_mid = right - left + 1 - \left(\frac{right - left}{2}\right) \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ not\_mid = \left(\frac{2(right - left) + 2 - (right - left)}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{right - left + 2}{2}\right) \]

Therefore, `not_mid` is \(\left(\frac{right - left + 2}{2}\right)\).

The values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < len(arr), `clique` is an integer representing the clique number to which the vertices will be assigned, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`.**
