You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Vertices and Edges Assignment**:
   - Assign integers `a_i` to vertices `i` such that `a_i` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - Add edges between vertices `(i, j)` if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   
2. **Clique Partitioning**:
   - Partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - Each vertex should belong to exactly one clique.
   - A clique is a set of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
- `func_1(n, k)`: This function aims to determine the number of cliques and assigns values to vertices and their respective cliques.
- `make_array(left, right, clique)`: This function fills in the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` for a specific range of vertices.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Global Variables**:
   - The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are used inside `make_array` but are not defined as global variables. This will lead to an error since Python treats variables defined inside a function as local unless explicitly declared as global.
   
2. **Clique Calculation**:
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`. This might not always be the optimal number of cliques for the given problem.
   
3. **Array Filling**:
   - The `make_array` function attempts to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`. However, it does not ensure that the values of `a_i` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The values assigned to `arr` are not guaranteed to satisfy the edge condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` but does not ensure that the graph formed is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not ensure that the values assigned to vertices are distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and it does not guarantee that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
