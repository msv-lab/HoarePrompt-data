The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `not_mid`. If `i` is less than `not_mid`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is one less than `not_mid` because the loop will have just completed its last iteration. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, but since we are at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be set to 0 initially for the new loop to begin.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be set to 0.

The other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, and the array values) do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head and their values are consistent with the loop's continuation.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < len(arr)`, `clique` is an integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 2) // 2`, `arr[left + i]` is `small_element + i` for `i` from `0` to `mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` from `0` to `mid + not_mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for `i` from `0` to `not_mid - 1`, `i` is 0**
