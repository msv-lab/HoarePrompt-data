`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer**
