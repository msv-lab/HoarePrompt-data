The code snippet `e = set(l)` converts the list `l` into a set `e`, which removes any duplicate elements from `l`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the list `l`.**
