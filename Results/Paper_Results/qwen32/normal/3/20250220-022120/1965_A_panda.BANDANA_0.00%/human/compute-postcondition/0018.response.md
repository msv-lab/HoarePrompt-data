Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `e` is a set of unique integers from the new list `l`; `m` is the length of the new list `l`; If the new `l` contains the integer 1, then `e` includes 1. Otherwise, the number 1 is not in the new list `l`; `i` is `t-1`. The condition `1 in l` determines whether the integer 1 is included in the set `e` or not.**

Since the postconditions for both the if and else parts are identical, the overall postcondition remains the same as the individual postconditions.
