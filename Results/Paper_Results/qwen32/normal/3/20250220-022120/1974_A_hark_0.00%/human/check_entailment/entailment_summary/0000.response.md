### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given functions and their behavior to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Function 1:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b
```
- This function returns the smaller of the two integers `a` and `b`.
- This function is not used in the main logic of the program, and its correctness is not directly relevant to the problem at hand.

#### Function 2:
```python
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)
```
- **Logic Breakdown:**
  - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**
    - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons, assuming each screen can fit up to 2 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and a 5x3 grid can fit up to 2 such icons).
    - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line seems to be incorrectly calculating the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons. The logic here is flawed because it subtracts 15 cells (which is the total number of cells in a screen) for each 2x2 icon placed, and then adds back 4 cells for each 2x2 icon, which doesn't make sense.
    - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This line calculates the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons, but the calculation of `x` is incorrect.
    - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This prints the total number of screens needed, but due to the incorrect calculation of `x`, this is not correct.
  
  - **Case 2: Only `y` is greater than 0**
    - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons.
  
  - **Case 3: Only `x` is greater than 0**
    - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `x` 1x1 icons.
  
  - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**
    - `print(0)`: This correctly handles the case where there are no icons.

#### Function 3:
```python
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
```
- This function handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_2` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The main issue lies in the logic of `func_2` when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. The calculation of the remaining cells and the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
