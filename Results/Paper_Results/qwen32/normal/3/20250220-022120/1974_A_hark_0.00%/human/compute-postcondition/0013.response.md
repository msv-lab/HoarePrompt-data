Let's analyze the given task step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x` <= 99 and 0 <= `y` <= 99.
   - At least one of `x` or `y` is 0.
   - It is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.
   - It is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.

2. **Interpreting the Conditions**:
   - The conditions imply that either `x` is 0 and `y` is 0, or `x` is 0 and `y` is 0 (which is the same condition).
   - Therefore, the only possible values for `x` and `y` that satisfy all conditions are `x = 0` and `y = 0`.

3. **Python Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(0)
   ```

4. **Analysis of the Print Statement**:
   - The `print(0)` statement directly prints the integer value `0`.
   - The values of `x` and `y` do not influence the output of this statement because it explicitly prints the number `0`.

5. **Output**:
   - The output of the `print(0)` statement is simply `0`.

Given the above analysis, the final output is:

Output: **0**
