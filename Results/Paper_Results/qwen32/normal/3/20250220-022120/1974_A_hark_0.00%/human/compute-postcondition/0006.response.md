To provide a specific output state, we need to understand what `func_2()` does. However, since `func_2()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we can only assume the function's behavior based on common practices and the given initial state. 

If `func_2()` does not modify any variables or return any values, the output state would be the same as the initial state. If `func_2()` modifies variables or returns a value, we would need that information to accurately determine the output state.

Given the lack of details about `func_2()`, let's assume the simplest case where `func_2()` does not affect the variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\)**

This means the value of `t` remains unchanged after the execution of `func_2()`.
