The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Given the initial state that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` will be overwritten by the new input value. Since the new value of `t` is determined by the user input, we cannot specify a concrete numerical value for `t` in the output state. However, we can state that the new value of `t` will still be a positive integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
