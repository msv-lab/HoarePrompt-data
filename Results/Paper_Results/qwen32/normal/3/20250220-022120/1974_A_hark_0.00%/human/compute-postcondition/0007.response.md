To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the effect of the loop on the variable `t`. The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration, the function `func_2()` is called, but the value of `t` itself is not modified within the loop. Therefore, the value of `t` remains constant throughout the loop execution.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first few iterations, we can infer the following:

- After 1 iteration, `t` is still a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- After 2 iterations, `t` is still a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\).
- After 3 iterations, `t` is still a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).

Since `t` does not change within the loop, after all `t` iterations, `t` will still be the same positive integer it was at the start, as long as it was within the initial range.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer between 1 and 10,000, inclusive.
