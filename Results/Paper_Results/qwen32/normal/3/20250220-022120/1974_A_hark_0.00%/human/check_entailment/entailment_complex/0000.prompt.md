Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Example

Input

    2 0
    
    15 0
    
    8 2
    
    0 9

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Functions:

    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b
    #The program returns the smaller of the two integers a and b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters and returns the smaller of the two.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: an integer between 1 and 7 (inclusive), depending on the value of `x`
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= `x` <= 99 and 0 <= `y` <= 99. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, then the conditions remain as specified in the if part. Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. It is also ensured that it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.
        #State: `x` and `y` are integers within the range 0 <= `x` <= 99 and 0 <= `y` <= 99. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. Additionally, it is ensured that it is not the case that both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
    #State: `x` and `y` are integers within the range 0 <= `x` <= 99 and 0 <= `y` <= 99. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y / 2`. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the conditions remain as specified. Otherwise, at least one of `x` or `y` is 0, and it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. Additionally, it is ensured that it is not the case that both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the input, where `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`. It then calculates and prints a value based on the conditions: if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it computes a specific formula and prints the result; if only `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`; if only `x` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`; if both are 0, it prints 0.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of times to execute `func_2()`. It then calls `func_2()` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value.
