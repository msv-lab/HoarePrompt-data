### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its logic to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of `5x3` screens needed to place `x` number of `1x1` icons and `y` number of `2x2` icons. Each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells, and each `1x1` icon occupies 1 cell. The total capacity of a `5x3` screen is 15 cells.

The program consists of three functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function returns the smaller of two integers. However, this function is not used anywhere in the program.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles the logic for each test case.
3. `func_3()`: This function handles the input for multiple test cases by calling `func_2()` for each test case.

Let's break down the logic in `func_2()`:

1. **Case 1**: If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
    - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the minimum number of screens required to place `y` `2x2` icons. Since each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen can fit a maximum of 4 `2x2` icons (16 cells), the number of screens needed is `ceil(y / 2)`.
    - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This adjustment is incorrect. The correct approach should be to calculate the remaining cells after placing the `2x2` icons and then place the `1x1` icons in the remaining cells.
    - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This attempts to calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining `1x1` icons. However, the adjustment made to `x` in the previous step is incorrect.
    - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This prints the total number of screens, which is the sum of screens needed for `2x2` and `1x1` icons.

2. **Case 2**: If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
    - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `y` `2x2` icons.

3. **Case 3**: If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
    - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `x` `1x1` icons.

4. **Case 4**: If both `x` and `y` are 0:
    - `print(0)`: This correctly outputs 0 screens needed.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for handling the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0 is incorrect. Specifically, the adjustment to `x` after placing `2x2` icons is incorrect.
- The calculation of `bxsfory1` is also incorrect due to the incorrect adjustment of `x`.

### Correct Approach:
- Calculate the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons: `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`.
- Calculate the remaining cells after placing the `2x2` icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * bxsfory - 4 * y`.
- Calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining `1x1` icons: `bxsfory1 = math.ceil((x - remaining_cells) / 15)` if `x - remaining_cells > 0` else `0`.
- The total number of screens is `bxsfory + bxsfory1`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0 due to incorrect adjustments and calculations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
