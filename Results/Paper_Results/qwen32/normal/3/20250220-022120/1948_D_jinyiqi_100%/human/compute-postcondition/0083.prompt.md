Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; For each of the t test cases, `s` is a list of characters consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with 1 <= len(s) <= 5000. The total length of all lists `s` over all test cases does not exceed 5000; `n` is the length of `s`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
    count = 0
    for k in range(0, n - j):
        if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        if count == j:
            print(count * 2)
            return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters with length `n` where 2 <= n <= 5000, `n` is the length of `s`, `j` is an integer such that 0 <= j < n, `k` is `n - j`, and `count` is the result of the last few iterations of the loop, but it is not equal to `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program completes without printing anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is `n - 1`, and `count` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
