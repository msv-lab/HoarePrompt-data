Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. The function `func_1()` is called without being defined in the correct context. The function should be defined before it is called.
2. The logic for counting the length of the tandem repeat substring is flawed. The program should check if the substring of length `j` from `k` to `k+j-1` is the same as the substring from `k+j` to `k+2*j-1`, considering the '?' characters as wildcards.
3. The program should replace '?' characters with some letter to maximize the tandem repeat length, but the current implementation does not perform any replacements.
4. The program should handle the case where no tandem repeat can be formed, which is correctly handled by printing `0`, but the logic to find the maximum tandem repeat length is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_tandem_repeat_length(s):
    n = len(s)
    max_length = 0
    
    # Try all possible lengths of the half of the tandem repeat
    for j in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        for k in range(n - 2 * j + 1):
            # Check if the two halves are identical, treating '?' as a wildcard
            is_tandem = True
            for l in range(j):
                if s[k + l] != s[k + j + l] and s[k + l] != '?' and s[k + j + l] != '?':
                    is_tandem = False
                    break
            if is_tandem:
                max_length = 2 * j
    
    return max_length

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    s = input().strip()
    print(max_tandem_repeat_length(s))
```

This corrected version defines a function `max_tandem_repeat_length` that checks all possible tandem repeat lengths and correctly handles the '?' characters as wildcards. The main loop then calls this function for each test case.
