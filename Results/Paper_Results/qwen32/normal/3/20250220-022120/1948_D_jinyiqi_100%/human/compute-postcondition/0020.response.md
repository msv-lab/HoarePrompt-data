Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a list of characters with length `n` where 2 <= n <= 5000, `n` is the length of `s`, `j` is an integer such that 0 <= j < n, `k` is incremented by 1. If `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]`, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0. If `count` is not equal to `j`, the program does not return any value.**
