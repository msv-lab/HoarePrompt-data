To determine what will be printed by the `print(count * 2)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the conditions that affect the value of `count`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`. This variable doesn't directly influence the `count` value or the print statement.
- `s` is a list of characters with length `n` where `2 <= n <= 5000`. This list contains the characters that will be used to determine the `count`.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `j` is an integer such that `0 <= j < n`. This variable is used as an offset in the conditions to compare characters in `s`.
- `k` is `k + 1`. This indicates that `k` is being incremented, but its initial value is not specified. We can assume `k` starts at 0 or some other value and increments by 1 each time the condition is checked.
- `count` is adjusted based on specific conditions:
  - If `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]`, then `count` is incremented by 1.
  - Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.

### Analysis of the `count` Calculation:
- The value of `count` depends on the characters in `s` and the value of `j`.
- The conditions check if either of the characters at positions `k` and `k + j` is a `'?'` or if the characters at these positions are equal.
- If any of these conditions are met, `count` is incremented by 1.
- If none of these conditions are met, `count` is reset to 0.

### Determining the Output:
- The print statement `print(count * 2)` will output twice the value of `count`.
- Since `count` can vary based on the characters in `s` and the value of `j`, the exact numerical value of `count` cannot be determined without specific values for `s` and `j`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be twice the value of `count` at the point of execution. Without the specific values of `s` and `j`, we cannot provide a numerical value for `count`.

Output: **count * 2 (where count is the number of times the condition s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j] is met consecutively, otherwise reset to 0)**
