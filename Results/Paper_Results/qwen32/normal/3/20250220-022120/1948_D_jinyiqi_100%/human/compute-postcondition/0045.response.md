Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. `s` is a list of characters with length `n` where \(2 \leq n \leq 5000\).
3. `n` is the length of `s`.
4. `j` is set to 1.
5. `k` is calculated as `n - j + 1`, which simplifies to `n`.
6. The value of `count` is determined based on the following conditions:
   - If either `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `count` is 0.
7. Additionally, it's stated that `count` is not equal to `j` (which is 1).

### Analysis:
Given that `j` is 1, `k` is `n`, and we have the conditions to determine `count`, let's analyze the possible values.

- If `s[n]` is '?' or `s[n + 1]` is '?' or `s[n]` is equal to `s[n + 1]`, then `count` is 2.
- Since `s` is a list of length `n`, `s[n + 1]` would be out of bounds. Therefore, the condition involving `s[n + 1]` can be disregarded.
- This leaves us with:
  - If `s[n]` is '?', then `count` is 2.
  - If `s[n]` is equal to `s[n]` (which is always true), then `count` is 2.
- Therefore, based on the conditions provided, `count` will always be 2.

### Code Execution:
The `print` statement is:
```python
print(count * 2)
```

Since `count` is 2, the expression `count * 2` evaluates to `2 * 2`, which is 4.

### Final Output:
Output: **4**
