Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `k` is 3, `s[k]` is not equal to '?', `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. If the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` is true, `count` is incremented by 1. If `count` is equal to `j + 1`, `count` is set to 0. If `count` equals `j`, the program returns nothing (None). Otherwise, if the condition is false, `count` is set to 0.**
