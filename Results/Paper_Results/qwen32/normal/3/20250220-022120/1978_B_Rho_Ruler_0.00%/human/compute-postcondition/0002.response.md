The code snippet modifies the value of `ans` by adding `(n - k) * a` to it. Given the initial state, the value of `ans` is initially `k * b`. After the execution of the code, the new value of `ans` will be `k * b + (n - k) * a`.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9; `ans` is `k * b + (n - k) * a`.**
