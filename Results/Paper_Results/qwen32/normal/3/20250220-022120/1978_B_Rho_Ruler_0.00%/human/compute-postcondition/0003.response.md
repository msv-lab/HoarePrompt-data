Output State: **The program returns True**

Explanation: Given the variables `a`, `b`, `n`, and `k`, the expression `ans` is calculated as `k * b + (n - k) * a`. The return statement checks if `ans` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. Since `ans` is a linear combination of `a` and `b` weighted by `k` and `n-k` respectively, and `max(a, b)` is the larger of the two, the inequality `ans <= n * max(a, b)` always holds true.
