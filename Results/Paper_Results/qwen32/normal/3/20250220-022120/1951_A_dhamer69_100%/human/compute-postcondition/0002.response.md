The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `start`, `end`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that start <= end; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer.**
