To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.
   - `t` must be at least 2 (greater than 1).
   - `n` is the integer value of the input.
   - `s` is the new input string.
   - If `n` is equal to 2:
     - If `s` is equal to '00', `s` remains '00'.
     - Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'.
   - If `n` is not equal to 2:
     - `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`.
     - If `count_1` is odd, then the specific conditions of the if part are met.
     - If `count_1` is even, then either `s.count('11')` is not equal to 1 or `count_1` is not equal to 2.

2. **Analysis of the Print Statement:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement does not depend on any of the conditions or variables mentioned above. It is a standalone print statement that will execute regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or the conditions regarding `count_1` and `s.count('11')`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement `print('YES')` will always output the string 'YES', irrespective of the values or conditions of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
