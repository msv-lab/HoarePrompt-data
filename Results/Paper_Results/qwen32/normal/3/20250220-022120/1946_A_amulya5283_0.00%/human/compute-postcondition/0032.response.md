The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the `heap` and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. Given that `heap` is a min-heap, `heap[0]` is the smallest element. After the `heappop` operation, the smallest element is no longer in `heap`, and the heap property is restored.

Since `heap` contains elements from `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end of `arr`, and `arr` is sorted in ascending order, the smallest element in `heap` is `arr[median_index]` if `median_index` is the last element, or the next element after `current_median` in `arr` otherwise.

After the operation, `heap` will have one less element, and `smallest` will hold the value of the smallest element that was removed from `heap`.

Output State: **`smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`; `heap` has one less element and the heap property is restored.**
