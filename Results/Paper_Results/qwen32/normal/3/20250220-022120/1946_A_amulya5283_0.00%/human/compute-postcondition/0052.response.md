The code snippet sets `operations` to 0, which overrides its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]`, `operations` is 0, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[n // 2]`.**
