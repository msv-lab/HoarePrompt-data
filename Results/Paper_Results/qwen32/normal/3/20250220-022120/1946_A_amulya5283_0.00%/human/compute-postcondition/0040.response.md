The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap. Given that `smallest` was already the smallest element in the heap and the heap property is restored after adding `smallest + 1`, executing this line will make `smallest` take the value of the next smallest element in the heap, which is `smallest + 1`.

The other variables (`current_median`, `operations`, and the heap property) remain unchanged. The precondition that `current_median` must be less than or equal to `smallest` still holds, as `smallest` is now `smallest + 1`.

Output State: **`smallest` is `smallest + 1`; `heap` has one more element, `smallest`; the heap property is restored; `current_median` must be less than or equal to `smallest`; `operations` is incremented by 2.**
