To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `heap[0] <= current_median`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the relevant variables**: The loop condition `heap[0] <= current_median` involves two variables: `heap[0]` and `current_median`.
2. **Understand the current state**:
   - `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, which currently includes `smallest + 1`.
   - `current_median` is the median of the sorted list `arr`.

3. **Condition for loop continuation**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` must be true. This means that the smallest element in the heap must be less than or equal to the current median.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `heap[0]` is `smallest + 1`, we need to ensure that `smallest + 1` is less than or equal to `current_median`.
   - If `smallest + 1` is greater than `current_median`, we need to adjust either `smallest` or `current_median` to make the condition true.

Given the current state, the simplest adjustment is to ensure that `smallest + 1` is indeed less than or equal to `current_median`. If `smallest + 1` is not less than or equal to `current_median`, we can adjust `smallest` to be such that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with one less element and now includes `smallest + 1`; `operations` is 1; `smallest` is the smallest element that was in the heap such that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`**

This ensures that the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is satisfied, and the loop can execute one more time.
