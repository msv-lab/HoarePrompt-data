The code snippet `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. The heap is now missing this element.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with one less element and includes `smallest + 1`.
- `smallest` is the smallest element that was in the heap such that `smallest + 1 <= current_median`.

After executing `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)`, the value of `smallest` is updated to the smallest element that was at the root of the heap. The heap now contains the remaining elements, excluding the one that was just popped.

Since the heap was initially constructed with `arr[median_index:]` and `smallest + 1`, after popping, the heap will be smaller by one element, and `smallest` will hold the smallest value from that heap.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` with one less element and now includes the next smallest element after the popped one; `operations` is 1; `smallest` is the smallest element that was at the root of the heap.**
