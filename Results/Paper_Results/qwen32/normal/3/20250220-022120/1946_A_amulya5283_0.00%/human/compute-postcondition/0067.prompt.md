Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, arr = test_cases[i]
    arr.sort()
    median_index = n // 2
    current_median = arr[median_index]
    heap = arr[median_index:]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    operations = 0
    while heap[0] <= current_median:
        smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
        heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
        operations += 1
    results.append(operations)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than `current_median`; `operations` is the total number of operations performed until the heap's root element is greater than `current_median`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: heap contains elements all greater than current_median, operations is the total number of increments performed to achieve this state, results contains the value of operations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: heap is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` where all elements are greater than the current median, operations is the total number of iterations the loop ran, results contains the value of operations and possibly other values from previous iterations, i is `k + 1`, t is `t`, n and arr are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with arr sorted in ascending order, median_index is `n // 2`, current_median is `arr[n // 2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
