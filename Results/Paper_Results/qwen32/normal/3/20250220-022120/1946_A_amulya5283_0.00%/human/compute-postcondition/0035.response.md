In the provided `while` loop, the loop condition is `heap[0] <= current_median`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as the smallest element in `heap` (which is `heap[0]` due to the heap property) is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`.
- `heap` has the same number of elements as before, with the heap property restored, and includes the value `smallest + 1`.
- `operations` is incremented by 1.

To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `heap[0] <= current_median` remains true.

Since `heap` has the heap property and includes the value `smallest + 1`, we know that `heap[0]` is the smallest element in `heap`. For the loop to execute one more time, `heap[0]` (which is `smallest + 1` after the restoration of the heap property) must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `current_median` is at least `smallest + 1`.

State: **`smallest` is the smallest element that was removed from `heap`; `heap` has the same number of elements as before, with the heap property restored, and includes the value `smallest + 1`; `current_median` must be at least `smallest + 1`; `operations` is incremented by 1**.
