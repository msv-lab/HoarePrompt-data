The given code snippet uses `heapq.heapify(heap)` to transform the list `heap` into a heap data structure. This operation rearranges the elements in `heap` to satisfy the heap property, but it does not change the values of the elements themselves; it only changes their order.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median` remain unchanged. The only variable that is affected is `heap`, which is now a heap.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]`.**
