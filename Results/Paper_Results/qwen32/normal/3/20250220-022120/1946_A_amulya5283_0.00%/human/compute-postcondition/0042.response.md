Output State: **`smallest` is `smallest + 1`; `heap` has one more element, `smallest + 1`; the heap property is restored; `current_median` must be less than or equal to `smallest`; `operations` is incremented by 3.**

The value of `operations` is incremented by 1, making it `operations + 1`. Since the initial state already mentioned that `operations` is incremented by 2, the final value of `operations` is `operations + 3`. Other variables remain unchanged.
