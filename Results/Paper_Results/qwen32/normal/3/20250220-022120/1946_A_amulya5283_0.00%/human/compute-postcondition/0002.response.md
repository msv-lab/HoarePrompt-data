The code snippet `n, arr = test_cases[i]` unpacks the i-th tuple from the `test_cases` list into the variables `n` and `arr`. Here, `n` will hold the first element of the tuple (an integer), and `arr` will hold the second element of the tuple (a list of integers).

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The `test_cases` list also remains unchanged because we are only reading from it, not modifying it. The `results` list remains empty as it is not affected by this line of code either. The variables `n` and `arr` are newly assigned values from the i-th tuple in `test_cases`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of n integers a_i such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`.**
