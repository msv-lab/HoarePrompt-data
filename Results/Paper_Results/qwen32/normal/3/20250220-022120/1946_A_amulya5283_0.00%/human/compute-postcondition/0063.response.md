The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` onto the heap, which was previously heapified and had its smallest element removed. This operation modifies the `heap` by adding a new element, but it does not affect the values of `operations`, `results`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, or `current_median`.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the heap now includes the element `smallest + 1`. The `heap` is still a valid heap after this operation, and all other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`heap` is a heapified version of `arr[median_index:]` with the smallest element removed and `smallest + 1` added, `operations` is 2, `results` contains the value of `operations`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t`, `n` and `arr` are assigned the values from `test_cases[k + 1]` with `arr` sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the smallest element that was in `heap` before the operation and has now been removed from `heap`.**
