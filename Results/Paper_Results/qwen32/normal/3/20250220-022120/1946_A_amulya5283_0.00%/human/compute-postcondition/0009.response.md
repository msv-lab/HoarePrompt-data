To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `heap[0] <= current_median`.

Here's the state right before the `while` loop:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`.
- `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`.
- `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]`.
- `operations` is 0.

The condition for the loop to execute is `heap[0] <= current_median`. To ensure that the loop can execute, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Let's break down the relevant parts:
- `arr` is sorted, so `current_median` is the median of the list.
- `heap` is constructed from the second half of the sorted list, `arr[median_index:]`.

To ensure that `heap[0] <= current_median`, we need to make sure that the smallest element in the heap (which is `heap[0]`) is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given that `heap` is constructed from `arr[median_index:]`, the smallest element in the heap will be `arr[median_index]` if `n` is odd, or the smallest element in the second half if `n` is even.

To guarantee that `heap[0] <= current_median`, we need to ensure that `arr[median_index]` (or the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]` if `n` is even) is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since `current_median` is the median of the list, it is already the middle element (or one of the two middle elements) in the sorted list. Therefore, `arr[median_index]` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `current_median` if `n` is odd, and the smallest element in `arr[median_index:]` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `current_median` if `n` is even.

Thus, no additional adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time, as the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is inherently satisfied given the construction of `heap` and `current_median`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the first element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the sorted list of the second element of the i-th tuple in `test_cases`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is the element at index `median_index` in `arr`; `heap` is a heap constructed from `arr[median_index:]`; `operations` is 0**
