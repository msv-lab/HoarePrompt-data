To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` is satisfied. The variables involved in this condition are `heap[0]` and `current_median`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Condition:**
   - `heap[0]`: The smallest element in the heap.
   - `current_median`: The median value of the array `arr`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `heap` contains elements from `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end of `arr`.
   - `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, where `median_index` is `n // 2`.

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.
   - Since `heap` is a heap, `heap[0]` is the smallest element in `heap`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that the smallest element in `heap` (i.e., `heap[0]`) is less than or equal to `current_median`.
   - Given that `heap` contains elements from `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end of `arr`, and `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `heap[0]` is `arr[median_index]` if `median_index` is the last element, or the next element after `current_median` in `arr` otherwise.

Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order, `heap[0]` should naturally be `arr[median_index]` or greater. To ensure the loop condition is met, we need to make sure that `heap[0]` is not greater than `current_median`. Since `heap` starts from `median_index` and `arr` is sorted, `heap[0]` should already be `arr[median_index]` or greater. 

However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to make sure that `heap[0]` is exactly `current_median` or less. Given the setup, this should naturally be the case since `heap` starts from `median_index`.

Therefore, no specific adjustment is needed to the state as long as `arr` is sorted and `heap` is correctly initialized from `median_index`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_i` such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`; `i` is 4; `n` is the first element of the 5th tuple in `test_cases`; `arr` is the second element of the 5th tuple in `test_cases` sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`; `heap` is a heap containing elements from `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end of `arr`; `operations` is 0**
