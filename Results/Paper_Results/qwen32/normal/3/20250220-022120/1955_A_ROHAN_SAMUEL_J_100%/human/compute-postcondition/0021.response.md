To determine the output, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The loop will run for `int(input()) - 1` more iterations, but this detail doesn't affect the current `print` statement as it is outside the loop.
- The conditions on `n`, `a`, and `b` are provided, but they do not affect the calculation of `n // 2 * b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Analysis:
- `n // 2` is the integer division of `n` by 2. This means it will give the floor value of `n / 2`.
- Multiplying the result by `b` will give the final value to be printed.

### Output:
The output will be the result of the expression `n // 2 * b`, which is the integer division of `n` by 2, multiplied by `b`.

Output: **(n // 2) * b** (where `n` is an integer read from the input and `b` is an integer read from the input)
