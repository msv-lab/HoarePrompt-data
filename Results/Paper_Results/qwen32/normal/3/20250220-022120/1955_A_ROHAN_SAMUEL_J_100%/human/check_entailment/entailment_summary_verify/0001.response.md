Let's carefully review the program and the original assessment to ensure everything aligns correctly with the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts given the price `a` for one yogurt and the price `b` for two yogurts under promotion. The logic should consider whether it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually or in pairs.

### Program Analysis

The program processes each test case as follows:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - Reads `t` (number of test cases).
   - For each test case, reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - **If `n` is odd:**
     - Checks if `2 * a < b`:
       - If true, prints `a * n` (buy each yogurt individually).
       - If false, prints `n // 2 * b + a` (buy as many pairs as possible and one yogurt individually).
   - **If `n` is even:**
     - Checks if `2 * a < b`:
       - If true, prints `a * n` (buy each yogurt individually).
       - If false, prints `n // 2 * b` (buy all yogurts in pairs).

### Verification with Example Test Cases

1. **First Test Case (`n=2`, `a=5`, `b=9`):**
   - `n` is even.
   - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
   - Expected: `9` (buy two yogurts at the promotion price).
   - Program Output: `9` (correct).

2. **Second Test Case (`n=3`, `a=5`, `b=9`):**
   - `n` is odd.
   - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
   - Expected: `14` (buy two yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price).
   - Program Output: `14` (correct).

3. **Third Test Case (`n=3`, `a=5`, `b=11`):**
   - `n` is odd.
   - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
   - Expected: `15` (buy each yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `15` (correct).

4. **Fourth Test Case (`n=4`, `a=5`, `b=11`):**
   - `n` is even.
   - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
   - Expected: `20` (buy each yogurt individually).
   - Program Output: `20` (correct).

### Conclusion

The logic in the program aligns with the problem description and correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` based on the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`. The program's behavior matches the expected outcomes for the provided test cases.

**Final: True**
