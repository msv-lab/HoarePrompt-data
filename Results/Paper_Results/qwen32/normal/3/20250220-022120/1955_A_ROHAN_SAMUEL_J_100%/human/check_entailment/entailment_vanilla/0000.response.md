Let's break down the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts. The store offers two pricing options:
- One yogurt for `a` burles.
- Two yogurts for `b` burles (promotion).

The goal is to minimize the total cost of purchasing `n` yogurts.

### Solution Analysis

The program iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`. The logic to compute the minimum cost is as follows:

1. If `n` is odd (`n % 2`):
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts separately (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`), then it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`b`), and buy the remaining single yogurt at the regular price (`a`). This results in a total cost of `n // 2 * b + a`.

2. If `n` is even:
   - If the cost of buying two yogurts separately (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`), then it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually, so the total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (`b`), resulting in a total cost of `n // 2 * b`.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1: n = 2, a = 5, b = 9**
   - Since `n` is even, and `2 * a (10)` is greater than `b (9)`, the optimal strategy is to buy two yogurts at the promotion price.
   - Cost: `2 // 2 * 9 = 9`

2. **Test Case 2: n = 3, a = 5, b = 9**
   - Since `n` is odd, and `2 * a (10)` is greater than `b (9)`, the optimal strategy is to buy one pair at the promotion price and one yogurt individually.
   - Cost: `3 // 2 * 9 + 5 = 14`

3. **Test Case 3: n = 3, a = 5, b = 11**
   - Since `n` is odd, and `2 * a (10)` is less than `b (11)`, the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts individually.
   - Cost: `3 * 5 = 15`

4. **Test Case 4: n = 4, a = 5, b = 11**
   - Since `n` is even, and `2 * a (10)` is less than `b (11)`, the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts individually.
   - Cost: `4 * 5 = 20`

The solution correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case as per the problem requirements.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for purchasing `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
