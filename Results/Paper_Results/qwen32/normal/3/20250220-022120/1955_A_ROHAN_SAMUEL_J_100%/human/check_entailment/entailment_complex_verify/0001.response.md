Let's analyze the program and the annotations to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

### Program Analysis:

The logic of the program is as follows:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - The program checks if `n` (the number of yogurts) is odd or even.
   - **If `n` is odd:**
     - It checks if `2 * a` (the cost of buying two yogurts at regular price) is less than `b` (the cost of buying two yogurts at promotion price).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, so it prints `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and buys the remaining yogurt individually. This is done by printing `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - **If `n` is even:**
     - It again checks if `2 * a` is less than `b`.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, so it prints `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, so it prints `n // 2 * b`.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the example test cases step-by-step:

1. **First Test Case (`n=2`, `a=5`, `b=9`):**
   - `n` is even.
   - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
   - The program correctly prints `9` (buying two yogurts at the promotion price).

2. **Second Test Case (`n=3`, `a=5`, `b=9`):**
   - `n` is odd.
   - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
   - The program correctly prints `14` (buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price).

3. **Third Test Case (`n=3`, `a=5`, `b=11`):**
   - `n` is odd.
   - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
   - The program correctly prints `15` (buying each yogurt individually).

4. **Fourth Test Case (`n=4`, `a=5`, `b=11`):**
   - `n` is even.
   - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
   - The program correctly prints `20` (buying each yogurt individually).

### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points and confirm the logic. The annotations match the program's behavior and the problem description's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices `a` and `b` for one yogurt and two yogurts, respectively.

**Final: True**
