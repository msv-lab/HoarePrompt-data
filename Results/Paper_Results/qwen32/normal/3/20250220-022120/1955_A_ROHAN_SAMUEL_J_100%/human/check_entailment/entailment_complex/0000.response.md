### Reasoning:

The program follows the logic required to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices `a` (price of one yogurt) and `b` (price of two yogurts with promotion). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Loop through Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
2. **Read Inputs**: For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. **Calculate Minimum Cost**:
   - If `n` is odd:
     - If the cost of buying two yogurts separately (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`), it calculates the total cost as `a * n` (buying each yogurt individually).
     - Otherwise, it calculates the total cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buying the remaining yogurt individually).
   - If `n` is even:
     - If the cost of buying two yogurts separately (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`), it calculates the total cost as `a * n` (buying each yogurt individually).
     - Otherwise, it calculates the total cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price).

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program's logic with the example test cases provided:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is even, and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the program should output `n // 2 * b = 2 // 2 * 9 = 9`.
   - **Output**: `9` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Since `n` is odd, and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the program should output `n // 2 * b + a = 3 // 2 * 9 + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - **Output**: `14` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is odd, and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, the program should output `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
   - **Output**: `15` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Since `n` is even, and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, the program should output `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.
   - **Output**: `20` (Correct)

The program's logic matches the expected output for the provided test cases.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
