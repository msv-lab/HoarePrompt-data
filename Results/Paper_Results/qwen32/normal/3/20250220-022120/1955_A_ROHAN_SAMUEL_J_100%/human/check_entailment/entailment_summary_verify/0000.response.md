Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts where:
- One yogurt costs `a` burles.
- Two yogurts cost `b` burles under promotion.

We need to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Analysis of the Program Code
The program processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`, and then calculates the minimum cost based on whether `n` is odd or even and the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`.

#### Case Breakdown
1. **If `n` is odd**:
    - The code checks if `2 * a < b`.
    - If `2 * a < b` (i.e., buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion), it calculates the cost as `a * n`.
    - If `2 * a >= b` (i.e., promotion is cheaper), it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the last yogurt individually).

2. **If `n` is even**:
    - The code checks if `2 * a < b`.
    - If `2 * a < b`, it calculates the cost as `a * n`.
    - If `2 * a >= b`, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts as pairs at the promotion price).

### Verification Using Function Summary
The function summary correctly describes the logic of the program. The program indeed checks the parity of `n` and the relationship between `2 * a` and `b` to determine the optimal cost.

### Checking the Original Assessment
The original assessment claims that the code is incorrect because it does not handle the scenario where `n` is odd and `2 * a < b` correctly. However, this claim is incorrect.

- If `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`, the code correctly calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually).
- If `n` is odd and `2 * a >= b`, the code correctly calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the last yogurt individually).

### Example Verification
Let's verify the example given in the original assessment:

- **Test Case**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
    - Since `n` is odd, the code checks if `2 * a < b` → `2 * 5 < 11` → `10 < 11` (True).
    - Therefore, the cost is calculated as `a * n` → `5 * 3` → `15`.
    - This calculation is correct because `11 + 5` (promotion for two and individual for one) is indeed `16`, which is more than `15`.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is incorrect because the program correctly handles all scenarios as described in the function summary. The code correctly calculates the minimum cost for both odd and even values of `n` based on the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
