Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific task.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `n` is an even number.
- `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`n // 2`**: This operation performs integer division of `n` by 2. Since `n` is an even number, `n // 2` will result in an integer value which is exactly half of `n`.
2. **`n // 2 * b`**: This multiplies the result of `n // 2` by `b`. Given that `n // 2` is an integer and `b` is an integer, the result of this multiplication will also be an integer.

### Output:
The output will be the result of the expression `n // 2 * b`, where `n` is an even integer and `b` is an integer.

### Final Output:
Output: **n // 2 * b (where n is an even integer and b is an integer)**
