Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code provided does not correctly handle all cases where the promotion price is cheaper than buying individual yogurts. Specifically, the code does not account for the scenario where the number of yogurts is odd and the promotion price is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually.

Let's analyze the code:
- If `n` is odd, the code checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually). If false, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the last yogurt individually).
- If `n` is even, the code checks if `2 * a < b`. If true, it calculates the cost as `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually). If false, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts as pairs at the promotion price).

However, if `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`, the code still calculates the cost as `a * n`, which might not be optimal if buying pairs and one yogurt separately is cheaper.

For example, consider the case:
- `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
- The code calculates the cost as `3 * 5 = 15` because `2 * 5 < 11` is false.
- However, the optimal cost is `11 + 5 = 16` (buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt individually).

In this case, the code does not produce the minimum cost, hence it is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
