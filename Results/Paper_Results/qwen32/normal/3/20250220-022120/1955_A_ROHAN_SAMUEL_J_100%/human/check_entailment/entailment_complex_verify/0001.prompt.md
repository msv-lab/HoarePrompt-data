You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the next t lines contains three integers n, a, and b, where 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. For each iteration, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` were read from the input. Depending on whether `n` is odd or even and the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`, the output was either `a * n` or `n // 2 * b + a` (for odd `n` when `2 * a >= b`) or `n // 2 * b` (for even `n` when `2 * a >= b`). The final output state is the result of all these individual outputs for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on whether `n` is odd or even and the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - The program checks if the number of yogurts `n` is odd or even.
   - **If `n` is odd:**
     - It checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2*a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, so it prints `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and buys the remaining yogurt individually. This is done by printing `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - **If `n` is even:**
     - It again checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2*a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, so it prints `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, so it prints `n // 2 * b`.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

1. **First Test Case (`n=2`, `a=5`, `b=9`):**
   - `n` is even.
   - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
   - The program correctly prints `9` (buying two yogurts at the promotion price).

2. **Second Test Case (`n=3`, `a=5`, `b=9`):**
   - `n` is odd.
   - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
   - The program correctly prints `14` (buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price).

3. **Third Test Case (`n=3`, `a=5`, `b=11`):**
   - `n` is odd.
   - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
   - The program correctly prints `15` (buying each yogurt individually).

4. **Fourth Test Case (`n=4`, `a=5`, `b=11`):**
   - `n` is even.
   - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
   - The program correctly prints `20` (buying each yogurt individually).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices `a` and `b` for one yogurt and two yogurts, respectively.
