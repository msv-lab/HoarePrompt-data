Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. For each iteration, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` were read from the input. Depending on whether `n` is odd or even and the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`, the output was either `a * n` or `n // 2 * b + a` (for odd `n` when `2 * a >= b`) or `n // 2 * b` (for even `n` when `2 * a >= b`). The final output state is the result of all these individual outputs for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished running for all `t` iterations. For each iteration, it processed the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` to determine the output based on whether `n` is odd or even and the relationship between `2 * a` and `b`. The final output state is the collection of all these outputs for each iteration.
