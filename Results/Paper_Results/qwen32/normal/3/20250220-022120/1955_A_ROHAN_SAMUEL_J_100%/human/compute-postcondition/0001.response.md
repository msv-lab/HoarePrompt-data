The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state only specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. This value of `t` is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.**
