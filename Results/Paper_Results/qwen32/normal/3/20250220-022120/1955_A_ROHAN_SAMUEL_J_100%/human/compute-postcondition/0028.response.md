Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. Regardless of whether `n` is odd or even, the relationship between `2 * a` and `b` remains unchanged: if `2 * a` is less than `b`, it stays less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. The loop will run for `int(input()) - 1` more iterations.**
