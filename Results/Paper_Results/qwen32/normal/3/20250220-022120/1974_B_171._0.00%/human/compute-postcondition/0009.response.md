The code provided is a `break` statement, which would typically be used to exit a loop or a conditional block. However, in the given context, there is no loop or conditional block for the `break` to exit, so the `break` statement does not affect the state of the variables. Therefore, none of the variables (`encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, or `n`) are modified.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `mapping` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{chr(c): char}`; `decoded` is an empty list; `char` is not in `mapping`.**
