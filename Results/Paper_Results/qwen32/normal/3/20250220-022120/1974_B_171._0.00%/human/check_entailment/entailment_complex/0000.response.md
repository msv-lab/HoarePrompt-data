Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string based on the problem description. The decoding process should map each character in the encoded string back to its original character using the symmetric character property from the auxiliary string `r`. 

However, the function `func_1` provided in the program does not follow this logic. Instead, it creates a mapping from characters in the encoded string to characters from 'a' to 'z' in the order they first appear, which does not align with the encoding process described. This results in an incorrect decoding of the string.

For example, if the encoded string is "serofedsoc", the program will not map 's' to 'c', 'e' to 'o', 'r' to 'd', etc., as required by the problem statement. Instead, it will map 's' to 'a', 'e' to 'b', 'r' to 'c', and so on, which leads to an incorrect output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
