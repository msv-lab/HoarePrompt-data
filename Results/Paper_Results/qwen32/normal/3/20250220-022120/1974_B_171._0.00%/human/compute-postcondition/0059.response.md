Output State: **The program returns the decoded string which is a transformed version of `encoded` where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a unique character from 'a' to 'z'.**

This means that the final output is the `decoded` string, which is derived by applying a unique character mapping from `encoded` to characters 'a' to 'z'.
