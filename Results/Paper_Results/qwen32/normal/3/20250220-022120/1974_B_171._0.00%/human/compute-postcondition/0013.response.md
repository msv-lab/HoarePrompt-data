Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `mapping` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair `{chr(c): char}`; `decoded` remains an empty list; `c` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `c` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
