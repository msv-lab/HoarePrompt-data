Let's analyze the loop and its behavior step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
   - `mapping` is an empty dictionary.
   - `decoded` is an empty list.
   - `char` is not in `mapping`.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the ASCII values from 'a' (97) to 'z' (122).
   - For each character `chr(c)` in this range, it checks if `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`.
   - If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, it adds the key-value pair `{chr(c): char}` to `mapping` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Execution Process:**
   - Since `mapping` is initially empty, the first character 'a' will not be in `mapping.values()`.
   - Therefore, the loop will add `{'a': char}` to `mapping` and break after the first iteration.
   - The loop will not execute further iterations because of the `break` statement.

4. **Final Output State:**
   - `encoded` remains unchanged as a string of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `mapping` will have one entry `{'a': char}`.
   - `decoded` remains an empty list.
   - `char` remains the same as it was in the initial state.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is `{'a': char}`, and `decoded` is an empty list.**
