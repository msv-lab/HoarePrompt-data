The only object in the loop head is the variable `char`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `encoded` string. If there are more characters in `encoded`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` was the last character processed from the `encoded` string. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character in the `encoded` string to be processed. Therefore, `char` should be the next character in the `encoded` string.

Since we do not have the specific value of `char` from the previous iteration or the exact position of `char` in `encoded`, we can only determine that `char` should be the next character in the sequence. Let's denote this next character as `char_next`.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or contains one entry `{'a': char}`, `decoded` is a list containing either the value `mapping[char]` if `char` exists in `mapping`, or `chr(c)` if `char` does not exist in `mapping`, `char` is `char_next`**
