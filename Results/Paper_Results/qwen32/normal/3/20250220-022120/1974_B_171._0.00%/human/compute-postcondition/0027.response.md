The `break` statement does not affect any of the variables. It only terminates the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in. Therefore, the values of `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, `c`, and `chr(c)` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `mapping` is `{'a': char}`; `decoded` is a list containing `chr(c)` since `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`; `char` is `char_next`; `c` is 97; and `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`.**
