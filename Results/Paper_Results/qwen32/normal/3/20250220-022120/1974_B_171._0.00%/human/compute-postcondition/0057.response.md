Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or contains one entry `{'a': char}`. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` is a list containing the value `char` appended to it. Otherwise, `mapping` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' as values, with the last character added being 'z' with the value `char_next_next`, and `decoded` is a list of characters with an additional character `chr(c)` appended to it.**
