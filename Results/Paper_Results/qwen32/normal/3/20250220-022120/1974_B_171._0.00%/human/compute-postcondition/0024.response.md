The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. This means `c` will take on values from 97 (ASCII for 'a') to 122 (ASCII for 'z').

Given this, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `c` is set to the starting value of the range, which is 97 (the ASCII value for 'a'). The other variables (`encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, `char`, `char_next`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `c` is 97. Here is the final state:

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` satisfying 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `mapping` is either an empty dictionary or contains one entry `{'a': char}`, `decoded` is a list containing either the value `mapping[char]` if `char` exists in `mapping`, or `chr(c)` if `char` does not exist in `mapping`, `char` is `char_next`, `c` is 97**
