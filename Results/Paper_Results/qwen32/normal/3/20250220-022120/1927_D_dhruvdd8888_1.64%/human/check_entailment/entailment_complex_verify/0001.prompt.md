You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads a list of integers and a series of queries. Each query specifies a range within the list, and the function outputs a pair of indices based on the sequence of identical numbers within that range. The function does not return a value explicitly but prints the results of each query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a_i != a_j`. If no such pair exists, we need to output `-1 -1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to be using a preprocessing step to create a list of intervals where the elements of the array are the same. The idea is to use binary search to quickly find the intervals that overlap with the query range `[l, r]`.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Queries for Large Test Cases**:
   - The program contains a conditional `if tc > 5` that skips processing queries for test cases beyond the 5th one. This is incorrect and results in incomplete output for those test cases.
   
2. **Incorrect Interval Handling**:
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the interval that starts within the query range `[l, r]`. It then checks if the interval starts before `l` or ends after `r` to determine if a pair can be found.
   - However, the logic for handling these intervals is flawed. For example, if the interval starts before `l` but ends within `[l, r]`, the program should still check if there are other intervals within `[l, r]` that have different values.
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the interval starts and ends within `[l, r]` but has the same value.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same.
   - It also does not handle cases where the range `[l, r]` contains only one element correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program is not correctly solving the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
