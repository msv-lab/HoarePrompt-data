To determine the output of the `print(s - 1, s)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

1. **Variables and their initial conditions**:
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `N`: The first integer read from the input.
   - `nums`: A list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` (the number of elements in `a`), `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers, and `nums[-1]` is `-1`.
   - `num`: This is `final_num`, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `arr`: A list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`.
   - `LA`: This is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `ppp`: If `ppp` is equal to 23, it remains 23. The exact value of `ppp` is not specified, but it doesn't affect our output.
   - `l` and `r`: Two integers read from the input.
   - `tc`: If `tc` is greater than 5, it is greater than 5. The exact value of `tc` is not specified, but it doesn't affect our output.
   - `eli`: The insertion point for `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`.
   - `s` and `e`: The first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

2. **Understanding the output**:
   - The `print(s - 1, s)` statement will print two values: `s - 1` and `s`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`, which means `LA` is the last valid index of `arr`.
   - `eli` is the insertion point for `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`. This means it is the position where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain the order of `arr`.

3. **Determining the values of `s` and `s - 1`**:
   - Since the exact values of `arr`, `eli`, and `LA` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `s` and `s - 1`.
   - However, we can describe the relationship between `s` and `s - 1` based on the given information.

Given the information, the `print(s - 1, s)` statement will output the values of `s - 1` and `s`, where `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the first element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
