The `print(-1, -1)` statement in the given Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables or objects defined in the initial state. It simply prints the two integers `-1` and `-1`.

Here's the breakdown of the reasoning:

- The `print` statement is hardcoded to output `-1, -1`.
- None of the variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`, `num`, `s`, `e`, `arr`, `LA`, `ppp`, `l`, `r`, `tc`, `eli`) influence the output of this particular `print` statement because the values to be printed are explicitly specified as `-1` and `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **-1, -1**
