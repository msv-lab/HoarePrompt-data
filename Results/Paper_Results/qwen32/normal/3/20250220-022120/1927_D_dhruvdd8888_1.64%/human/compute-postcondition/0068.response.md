To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. **Variable `N`**: The first integer read from the input.
3. **List `nums`**: 
   - `nums[0]` is `n`.
   - `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - `nums[-1]` is `-1`.
4. **Variable `num`**: This is `final_num`, but its exact value is not specified.
5. **List `arr`**: A list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`.
6. **Variable `LA`**: `len(arr) - 1`.
7. **Variable `ppp`**: If `ppp` is equal to 23, it remains 23. However, its initial value is not provided.
8. **Variables `l` and `r`**: These are two integers read from the input.
9. **Variable `tc`**: If `tc` is greater than 5, it is greater than 5. However, its initial value is not provided.
10. **Variable `eli`**: The insertion point for `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`.
11. **Variables `s` and `e`**: 
    - `s` and `e` are the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s, e + 1)
```

### Analysis:

- **List `arr`**: This list contains tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`. Each tuple in `arr` is structured as `(value, start_index, end_index)`.
- **Variable `LA`**: This is the last index of `arr`, which is `len(arr) - 1`.
- **Variable `eli`**: This is the insertion point for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`. The `bisect_left` function would typically be used to find this insertion point, but the exact method is not specified.
- **Variables `s` and `e`**: These are derived from the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. Specifically, `s` is the first element (the value of the sequence), and `e` is the second element (the start index of the sequence).

### Output Explanation:

- **`s`**: This is the value of the sequence at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
- **`e + 1`**: This is the start index of the sequence at the index `min(eli, LA)`, incremented by 1.

Since the exact values of `eli`, `arr`, `LA`, `s`, and `e` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **s, e + 1 (where `s` is the value of the sequence and `e + 1` is the start index of the sequence at the index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`)**
