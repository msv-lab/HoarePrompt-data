The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This statement directly prints the values `-1` and `-1`, separated by a space. None of the variables or objects described in the initial state are used in this print statement. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `N`, `nums`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `ppp`, `l`, `r`, `tc`, `eli`, `s`, or `e`.

Output: **-1, -1**
