Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input; `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` and `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers, and `nums[-1]` is `-1`; `num` is `final_num`; `arr` is a list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; If `ppp` is equal to 23, then `ppp` remains equal to 23; `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input; Additionally, if `tc` is greater than 5, then `tc` is greater than 5; `eli` is the insertion point for `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`; `s` and `e` are the first two elements of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. The state of all variables remains unchanged regardless of whether `s > l` or not, and the value of `e` is compared with `r` without altering the state of the variables.**
