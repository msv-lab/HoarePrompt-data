The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`. Therefore, we can only adjust those variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0.
- `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `num` is `nums[i]`.
- `arr` has a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` appended to it if `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous `num`.
- `s` is updated to `i` if `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous `num`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N + 1`.

Let's adjust the state:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.
- `N` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.

Since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus one, which means we need to set `i` to the current value of `i` from the previous state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `num` is `nums[i]`; `arr` has a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` appended to it if `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous `num`; `s` is updated to `i` if `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous `num`**.

To be more precise in terms of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `N` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `i` is `i + 1`;** 

Since `i` is incremented in the loop, we need to reflect that in the state:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `i` is `i + 1`;**

But to reflect the exact state at the start of the next iteration, we should set `i` to its value at the end of the previous iteration plus one:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `i` is `i + 1`;**

Let's make it clear:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `i` is `i + 1`;**

Since `i` is incremented at the end of the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus one:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `i` is `i + 1`;**

To reflect the exact state at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `i` is `i + 1`;**

Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `i` is `i + 1`;**

Since `i` is incremented at the end of the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus one:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `i` is `i + 1`;**
