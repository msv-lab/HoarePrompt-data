The provided `print` statement in the Python code snippet is:

```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The `print` function will output the values `-1` and `-1` separated by a space.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` function is called with two arguments: `-1` and `-1`.
2. The `print` function outputs these arguments separated by a space.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **-1, -1**
