You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, followed by a list a of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. Each test case also includes an integer q such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, followed by q queries, each query being a pair of integers (l, r) such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all q across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input; `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` and `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers, and `nums[-1]` is `-1`; `num` is `final_num`; `s` is `final_s`; `e` is 0; `arr` is a list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`.

If `ppp` is equal to 23, then `ppp` remains equal to 23. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, and the state of all variables outside the loop body remains as described.`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a list `a` of `n` integers, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. Each query consists of a pair of integers `(l, r)` indicating a range in the list `a`. The function processes these queries and returns the result for each query, which is not specified in the given details.
