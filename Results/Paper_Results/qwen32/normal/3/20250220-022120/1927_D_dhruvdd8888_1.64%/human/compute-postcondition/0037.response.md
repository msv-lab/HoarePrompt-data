The provided Python code snippet uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the list `arr`. This insertion point is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would need to be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`. The result of this operation is stored in the variable `eli`.

Given the initial state, the only variable affected by the code is `eli`, which is assigned the result of the `bisect_left` function. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input; `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` and `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers, and `nums[-1]` is `-1`; `num` is `final_num`; `s` is `final_s`; `e` is 0; `arr` is a list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`. If `ppp` is equal to 23, then `ppp` remains equal to 23. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged; `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input. Additionally, if `tc` is greater than 5, then `tc` is greater than 5; `eli` is the insertion point for `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr`.**
