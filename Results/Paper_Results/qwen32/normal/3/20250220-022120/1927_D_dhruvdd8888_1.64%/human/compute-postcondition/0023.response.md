The code snippet `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `i`, `arr`, and `s`) remain unchanged by this assignment. The specific value of `num` after the assignment will be the value at the index `i` in the list `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `i` is either `i + 1` or `i + 2`. If `nums[i] != num`, then `arr` has a new element `(1 + s, i - 1, num)` appended to it and `s` is updated to `i + 2`; `num` is `nums[i]`.**
