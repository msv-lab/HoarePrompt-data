The code snippet `num = nums[0]` assigns the first element of the list `nums` to the variable `num`. Given that `nums[0]` is `n`, the variable `num` will now hold the value of `n`.

The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input; `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` and `nums[1:]` is the list `a` of `n` integers; `num` is `n`; `s` is 0; `e` is 0.**
