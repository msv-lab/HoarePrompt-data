The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each of those strings into an integer, forming a list of integers.

Given the initial state, this line of code will read the first line of input for a test case, which should contain the integer `n` followed by a list `a` of `n` integers. Therefore, `nums` will be assigned the values read from this line.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input; `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` and `nums[1:]` is the list `a` of `n` integers; each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, followed by a list `a` of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; each test case also includes an integer `q` such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, followed by `q` queries, each query being a pair of integers (l, r) such that 1 <= l < r <= n; the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; the `input` variable is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`.**
