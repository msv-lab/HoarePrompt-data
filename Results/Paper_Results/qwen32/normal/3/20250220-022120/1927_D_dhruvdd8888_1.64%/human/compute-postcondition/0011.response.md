The code snippet `s = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `s`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we can only state that `s` will now hold the same value as `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers where `nums[0]` is `n` and `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers, and `nums[-1]` is `-1`; `num` is `n`; `s` is `i`; `e` is 0; `arr` is `[(1, i, num)]`.**
