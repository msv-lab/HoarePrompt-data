To determine what will be printed by the `print(nums)` statement, let's break down the information given in the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `N` is the first integer read from the input.
- `nums` is a list of integers where:
  - `nums[0]` is `n` (the first integer in the `nums` list).
  - `nums[1:-1]` is the list `a` of `n` integers.
  - `nums[-1]` is `-1` (the last integer in the `nums` list).
- `num` is `final_num`.
- `s` is `final_s`.
- `e` is 0.
- `arr` is a list of tuples representing sequences of identical numbers in `nums`.
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `ppp` is equal to 23.

Given this information, the `print(nums)` statement will output the entire `nums` list. The specific values of `nums` depend on the input, but we can describe the structure of `nums` based on the initial state:

- `nums` starts with an integer `n`.
- It is followed by `n` integers (the list `a`).
- It ends with `-1`.

Since the exact values of `n` and the integers in `a` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot provide the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, we can describe the structure accurately.

Output: **[n, a1, a2, ..., an, -1] (where n is the first element of nums, a1, a2, ..., an are the elements of the list a, and -1 is the last element of nums)**
