The code snippet appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple contains the values `(1 + s, i, num)`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 before the code snippet is executed, so we need to account for this in the output state.

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged, `N` remains the first integer read from the input, and `i` is incremented by 1. The list `arr` has a new element added to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `i` is `i + 2`; `arr` has a new element `(1 + s, i - 1, num)` appended to it.**

In natural language: The value of `t` stays the same, `N` remains the first integer read from the input, `i` is increased by 2 (since it was already incremented by 1 before the code snippet), and a new tuple `(1 + s, i - 1, num)` is added to the list `arr`.
