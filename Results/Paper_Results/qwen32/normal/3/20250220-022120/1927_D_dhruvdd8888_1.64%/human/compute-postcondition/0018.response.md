The code snippet provided assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `N`, `arr`, `s`, or the condition that `i` is `i + 1`. The only variable that changes is `num`, which now holds the value of `nums[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `N` is the first integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `num` is `nums[i]`; `arr` has a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` appended to it if `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous `num`; `s` is updated to `i` if `nums[i]` is not equal to the previous `num`.**
