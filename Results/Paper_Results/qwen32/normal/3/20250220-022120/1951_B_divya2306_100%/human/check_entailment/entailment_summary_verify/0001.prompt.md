You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3

    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n`, another integer `k`, and a list of `n` distinct integers `a`. It calculates and prints the maximum number of participants that can be placed before the `k`-th participant in a sorted list without exceeding the `k`-th participant's value, considering a possible swap of the `k`-th participant with one of the participants that can be placed after it. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine the maximum number of matches that cow `k` can win in a tournament where cows compete based on their Cowdeforces ratings. Cow `k` can swap positions with another cow exactly once, or choose not to swap at all.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of a main loop that processes each test case by calling `func_1()`. Inside `func_1()`, the program calculates the number of wins cow `k` can achieve with and without swapping positions.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initial Wins Calculation**:
    - The program iterates through the list of cows from the start up to cow `k` to count how many cows have a rating less than or equal to cow `k`'s rating.
    - This count is stored in the variable `wins`.

2. **Adjusting Wins if Cow `k` Reaches the End**:
    - If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means cow `k` would win all matches up to its current position and then lose the next match. The program prints `wins - 1` in this case.

3. **Considering Swapping**:
    - The program then calculates the potential wins if cow `k` were to swap positions with a cow that would allow it to win additional matches.
    - It starts from the position `wins` (the first position where cow `k` would lose) and counts how many more cows have a rating less than or equal to cow `k`'s rating.
    - This count is stored in `win_with_swap`.

4. **Final Output**:
    - The program prints the maximum of two values:
        - `wins - 1`: The number of wins if cow `k` does not swap.
        - `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`: The number of wins if cow `k` swaps, adjusted by the initial wins and a condition to ensure correct counting.

### Issues in the Program

The logic for calculating `win_with_swap` is flawed. Specifically, the loop that calculates `win_with_swap` starts from `win_with_swap` (which is `wins + 1`) and goes up to `k - 1`. However, this logic does not correctly simulate the effect of swapping cow `k` with another cow and then counting the wins.

### Correctness

Given the issues in the logic for calculating `win_with_swap`, the program is not correctly determining the maximum number of wins cow `k` can achieve. The program does not properly simulate the effect of swapping cow `k` with another cow and then counting the wins from the new position.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
