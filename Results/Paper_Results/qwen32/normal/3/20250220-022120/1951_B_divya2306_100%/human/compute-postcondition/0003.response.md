The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the `range(n)` function will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Given the constraints, `n` is already specified to be at least 2, so the loop will definitely execute.

The variable `i` is the loop control variable and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so there is no need to specify its initial state before the loop begins.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The existing state already ensures that the loop will run.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct; `wins` is 0**
