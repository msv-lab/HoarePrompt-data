Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct, `wins` is less than k - 2, `win_with_swap` is wins + 2, `i` is `win_with_swap + 1`. If `a[i] > a[k - 1]`, the condition is met, otherwise, it is not.**
