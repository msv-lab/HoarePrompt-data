The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range defined by `win_with_swap` and `k - 1`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k - 1` and starts from `win_with_swap`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `win_with_swap + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `win_with_swap + 2`, and it must still be less than `k - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ k ≤ n
- `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct
- `wins` is less than k - 2
- `win_with_swap` is wins + 3
- `i` is `win_with_swap + 1`

We need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct, `wins` is less than k - 2, `win_with_swap` is wins + 3, `i` is `win_with_swap + 2`**
