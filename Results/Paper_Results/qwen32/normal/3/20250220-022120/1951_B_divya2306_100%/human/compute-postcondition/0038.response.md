Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n`, another integer `k`, and a list of `n` distinct integers `a`. It calculates and prints the maximum number of participants that can be placed before the `k`-th participant in a sorted list without exceeding the `k`-th participant's value, considering a possible swap of the `k`-th participant with one of the participants that can be placed after it. The function does not return any value.**
