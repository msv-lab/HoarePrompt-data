The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about variables `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be exactly what is specified in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Information:**
   - `n_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and its current value is 1.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print(1)` statement is executed.
   - This statement directly outputs the integer `1`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n_cases`, `i`, or `n`, the output is straightforward.

Output: **1**
