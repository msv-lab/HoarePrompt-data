The `print(1)` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions defined in the initial state. The initial state describes values for `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`, but these are not used in the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print(1)` statement is a direct print of the integer `1`.
2. No variables from the initial state (`n_cases`, `i`, `n`) are involved in this print statement.
3. Therefore, the output will simply be the number `1`.

Output: **1**
