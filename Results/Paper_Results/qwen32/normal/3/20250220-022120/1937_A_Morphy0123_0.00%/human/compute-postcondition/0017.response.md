`power` is decremented by 1. The value of `n_cases`, `i`, `n`, and the original value of `power` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `power` is `ceil(log2(n)) - 1` and `power` is not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `power` is `ceil(log2(n)) - 1` and `power` is not equal to `n`.**
