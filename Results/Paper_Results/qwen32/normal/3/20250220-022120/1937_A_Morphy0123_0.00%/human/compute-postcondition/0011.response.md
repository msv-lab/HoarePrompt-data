The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `power` is less than `log2(n)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 4, and `power` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`. Given that `power` is currently 3, `n` must be greater than \(2^3 = 8\).

So, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 8. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 3**
