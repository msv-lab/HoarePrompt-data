The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n_cases`. If `i` is less than `n_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is not equal to 1, then `power` is set to 3 if `power` is not already equal to `n` (where `16 <= n < 32`); otherwise, `power` remains equal to `n`.**
