Postcondition: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is equal to 1, then no additional changes are made to `n`. Otherwise, `power` is calculated as `ceil(log2(n))`. If `power` is equal to `n`, then `power` remains `n`. Otherwise, `power` is set to `ceil(log2(n)) - 1` and `power` is not equal to `n`.**
