To determine the final output state after the loop has completed all its iterations, we need to understand the condition under which the loop terminates. The loop continues to execute as long as `power` is less than `log2(n)`. Therefore, the loop will terminate when `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`, meaning `power` will be equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. This smallest integer is known as the ceiling of `log2(n)`, often denoted as `ceil(log2(n))`.

From the given information, we can see that:
- After 1 iteration, `power` becomes 2, which means `log2(n)` must be greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3.
- After 2 iterations, `power` becomes 3, which means `log2(n)` must be greater than or equal to 3 but less than 4.
- After 3 iterations, `power` becomes 4, which means `log2(n)` must be greater than or equal to 4 but less than 5.

So, if the loop executes `k` times, `power` will be `k+1` and `log2(n)` must be in the range `[k+1, k+2)`. The loop will terminate when `power` is equal to `ceil(log2(n))`.

To generalize, if the loop executes `m` times, then `power` will be `m+1` and `log2(n)` must be in the range `[m+1, m+2)`. Therefore, the loop will terminate when `power` is equal to `ceil(log2(n))`.

Given that the output states after the first 3 iterations indicate that `power` becomes 4, we can infer that the loop will terminate when `power` is equal to `ceil(log2(n))`. Since `power` is 4 after 3 iterations, `log2(n)` must be in the range `[4, 5)`, meaning `n` must be in the range `[16, 32)`.

Therefore, the loop will terminate when `power` is 4, and the final output state will be:
Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer such that `16 <= n < 32`, `power` is 4.**

In simpler terms, the loop will stop when `power` reaches 4, which means `n` must be at least 16 but less than 32, and `power` will be 4.
