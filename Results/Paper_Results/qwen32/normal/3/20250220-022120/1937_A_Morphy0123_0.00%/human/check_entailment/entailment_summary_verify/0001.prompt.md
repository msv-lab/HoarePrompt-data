You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and determines the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. It then prints this power of 2. If `n` is a power of 2, it prints `n` itself.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves an array where initially, `a_i = i` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. The task is to perform a series of swap operations defined by the function `swap(k)`, where `k` ranges from `2` to `n`. The `swap(k)` operation swaps the elements `a_d` and `a_k`, where `d` is the largest divisor of `k` other than `k` itself. After all swaps, we need to determine the position of the number `1` in the array.

### Key Insight
The key insight to solve this problem efficiently is that the final position of `1` is `2^p`, where `p` is the largest integer such that `2^p ≤ n`. This is because the swap operations essentially move `1` to the highest power of `2` that is less than or equal to `n`.

### Correctness of the Provided Program
Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly implements this insight.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Handling Special Case `n = 1`:**
   - If `n = 1`, the array is `[1]`, and no swaps are performed. Thus, the position of `1` remains `1`.

3. **Calculating the Largest Power of 2:**
   - For `n > 1`, the program calculates the largest power of `2` that is less than or equal to `n`.
   - It initializes `power` to `1` and increments it until `2^power` is greater than `log2(n)`.
   - The program then checks if `2^power` equals `n`. If so, it prints `2^power`. Otherwise, it decrements `power` by `1` and prints `2^(power-1)`.

### Issues in the Program
- **Incorrect Calculation of Power of 2:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates the power of `2` by comparing `2^power` with `log2(n)`. This is not the correct approach to find the largest power of `2` less than or equal to `n`.
  - The correct approach is to find the maximum `p` such that `2^p ≤ n`.

### Correct Approach
To correctly determine the largest power of `2` less than or equal to `n`, the program should use a loop to find the maximum `p` such that `2^p ≤ n`.

### Correct Program
Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 0
            while (1 << power) <= n:
                power += 1
            print(1 << (power - 1))

func()
```

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly determine the position of `1` after the swap operations. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
