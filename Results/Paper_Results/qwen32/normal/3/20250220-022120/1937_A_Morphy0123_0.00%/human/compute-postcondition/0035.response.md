The value of `power` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `power` is 4, so after the decrement, `power` becomes 3. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer such that `16 <= n < 32`, and `power` is not equal to `n` is still valid, with the updated value of `power`.

Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer such that `16 <= n < 32`, `power` is 3**.
