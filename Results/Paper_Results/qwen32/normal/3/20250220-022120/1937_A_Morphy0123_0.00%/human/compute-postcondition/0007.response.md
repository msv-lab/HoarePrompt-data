To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the condition `power < log2(n)`.

Here's the given state:
- `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 1
- `power` is 1

The condition for the loop to execute is `power < log2(n)`. Given that `power` is 1, we need to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

The logarithm base 2 of `n` (denoted as `log2(n)`) is greater than 1 if `n` is greater than 2. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 2.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `power` is already 1, so no adjustment is needed for `power`.
- `n` must be greater than 2 to satisfy `log2(n) > 1`.

No other variables in the loop condition need to be adjusted.

State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 1**
