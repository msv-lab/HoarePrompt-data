To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop operates and how the variables change with each iteration.

The loop condition is `while power < log2(n)`. The loop increments `power` by 1 in each iteration. The loop will continue until `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`.

From the output states provided:
- After 1 iteration: `power` is 2, so `log2(n)` must be greater than 2, meaning `n` must be greater than 4.
- After 2 iterations: `power` is 3, so `log2(n)` must be greater than 3, meaning `n` must be greater than 8.
- After 3 iterations: `power` is 4, so `log2(n)` must be greater than 4, meaning `n` must be greater than 16.

The loop will stop when `power` is equal to `log2(n)` or greater. Therefore, the final value of `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`, which is `ceil(log2(n))`.

Given the pattern, after all iterations, `power` will be `ceil(log2(n))`. The variables `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `power` is `ceil(log2(n))`.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`. The values of `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged.
