Reasoning:
The provided program is almost correct but contains a small typo in one of the print statements. The program is supposed to print 'STAIR' when `a < b < c`, but it mistakenly prints 'STAIRS'. All other conditions and logic are correctly implemented according to the problem description.

Since the typo in the print statement means that the output will not match the expected result for the 'STAIR' case, the program is not correct as per the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
