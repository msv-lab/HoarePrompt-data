Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or neither. However, there is a typo in the output string for the "STAIR" condition. The program prints 'STAIRS' instead of 'STAIR'. This typo makes the output incorrect according to the problem description, which specifies that the output should be "STAIR" without the 'S'.

Correctness: **False**
