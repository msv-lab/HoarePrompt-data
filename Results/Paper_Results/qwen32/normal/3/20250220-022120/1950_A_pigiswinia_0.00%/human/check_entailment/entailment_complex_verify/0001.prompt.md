You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: t is the integer input provided by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); a, b, and c are the integers input by the user such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\); i is t-1. For each of the t iterations, the program has printed either 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions a < b < c, a < b > c, or neither, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9). It prints 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' if neither condition is met.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers, `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are digits between 0 and 9.
3. The program then checks if the digits form a stair (a < b < c) or a peak (a < b > c).
4. If the digits form a stair, it prints "STAIRS".
5. If the digits form a peak, it prints "PEAK".
6. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

However, there is a mistake in the program: it prints "STAIRS" instead of "STAIR" when the digits form a stair. This discrepancy between the expected output and the actual output makes the program incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
