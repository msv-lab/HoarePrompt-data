Output State: **t is the integer input provided by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); a, b, and c are the integers input by the user such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\); i is t-1. For each of the t iterations, the program has printed either 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions a < b < c, a < b > c, or neither, respectively.**

In simple terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `t-1` (since the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`). For each set of inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` provided in each iteration, the program will have printed 'STAIRS' if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, and 'NONE' if neither of these conditions is true. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will reflect the last set of inputs processed by the loop.
