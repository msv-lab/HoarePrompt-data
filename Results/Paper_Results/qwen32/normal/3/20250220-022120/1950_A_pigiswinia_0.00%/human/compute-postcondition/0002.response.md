The code snippet takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer input provided by the user within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\). After executing the code, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided by the user such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers input by the user such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\)**.
