You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

    #State: The loop has finished executing `t` times, and for each iteration, it has printed a value based on the conditions involving `n`, `a`, and `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged from their input values, except that `t` has been decremented to 0 as the loop has completed all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationships between `n`, `a`, and `b`. The input values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

Bob sells `n` buns with a usual price of `a` coins each. He can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price where the `i`-th bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is sold for `(b - i + 1)` coins. The goal is to maximize the profit from selling all `n` buns.

### Key Observations

1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price would be less or equal to `a` and thus not beneficial.
   - **Action:** Sell all `n` buns at `a` coins each.
   - **Profit:** `n * a`

2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it's optimal to sell all `n` buns at the modified price because the price of each bun can be higher than `a` and the prices are decreasing by 1 for each subsequent bun.
   - **Action:** Sell all `n` buns at modified prices `(b - i + 1)` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - **Profit:** Sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`, which is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

3. **Case 3: `b > a` and `b - a < n`**
   - Here, the optimal strategy involves selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.
   - **Action:** Determine the maximum `k` such that the profit is maximized.
   - **Profit:** Sum of the first `k` terms of the series `(b - i + 1)` plus `(n - k) * a`.
   - **Calculation:** Sum of the first `k` terms of the series `(b - i + 1)` is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` when `k = b - a + 1` (the maximum `k` that satisfies `b - k + 1 >= a`).

### Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program based on the above observations:

- **Case 1:** The program correctly calculates the profit as `n * a` when `b <= a`.
- **Case 2:** The program correctly calculates the profit as `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` when `b - a >= n`.
- **Case 3:** The program does not correctly handle this case. The provided formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n` does not correctly compute the maximum profit for this scenario. Instead, it seems to be attempting to sum the first `b - a + 1` terms of the series and then adding the profit from the remaining buns. However, it does not correctly determine the optimal `k` and the corresponding profit.

### Correctness

The program does not correctly handle the third case, which can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not correct for all scenarios.

**Correctness:** **False**
