Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as read from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` is less than or equal to `a`. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than `a`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is either greater than or equal to `n` or less than `n`.**
