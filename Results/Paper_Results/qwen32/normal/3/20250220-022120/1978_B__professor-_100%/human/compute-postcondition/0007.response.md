Let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as read from the input.
- `b` is greater than `a`.
- The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
```

### Explanation:
The code calculates an integer value using the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{(2 \cdot b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2} \right\rfloor\).

1. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `2 * b`: This is simply twice the value of `b`.
   - `2 * b - n`: This subtracts `n` from `2 * b`.
   - `2 * b - n + 1`: This adds 1 to the result of the previous step.
   - `(2 * b - n + 1) * n`: This multiplies the result by `n`.
   - `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`: This performs integer division by 2, effectively halving the result.

2. **Interpretation**:
   - The formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{(2 \cdot b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2} \right\rfloor\) is essentially calculating the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - Specifically, it is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - n + 1`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The final output is the integer value of the calculated sum of the series.

### Output:
Output: **the integer value of \(\left\lfloor \frac{(2 \cdot b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2} \right\rfloor\) (where \(b\) is greater than \(a\) and the difference between \(b\) and \(a\) is greater than or equal to \(n\))**
