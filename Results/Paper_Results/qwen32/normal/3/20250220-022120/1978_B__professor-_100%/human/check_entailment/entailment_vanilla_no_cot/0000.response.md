Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns under the given promotion rules. Let's analyze the problem and the program:

1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - If the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price. The program correctly handles this case by printing `n * a`.

2. **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is greater than or equal to the number of buns, Bob should sell all buns at the modified price. The program correctly handles this case by printing the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

3. **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is less than the number of buns, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price. The program incorrectly handles this case. It calculates the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic sequence and adds `a * n`, which is incorrect because not all buns are sold at the usual price.

The correct approach for Case 3 should be:
- Calculate the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic sequence.
- Add the product of `a` and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(n, b - a + 1)
            modified_price_profit = (b + b - k + 1) * k // 2
            usual_price_profit = a * (n - k)
            print(modified_price_profit + usual_price_profit)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- `k` is the number of buns sold at the modified price, which is the minimum of `n` and `b - a + 1`.
- `modified_price_profit` is the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price.
- `usual_price_profit` is the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
