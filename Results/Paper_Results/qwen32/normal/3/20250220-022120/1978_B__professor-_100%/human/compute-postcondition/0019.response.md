The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution. The loop depends on the variable `t` to determine how many times it will execute. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\).

Since the loop iterates `t` times, after each iteration, `t` effectively decreases by 1 until it reaches 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\) and `t` is decremented by 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged**.

Since we are only adjusting the state of `t` in the loop head, and the problem specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, we can express the new state as:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 < t-1 \leq 10^4\), `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged**.

To simplify, we can say:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged**.
