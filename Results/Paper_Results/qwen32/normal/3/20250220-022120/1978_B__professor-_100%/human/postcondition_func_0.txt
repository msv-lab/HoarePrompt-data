The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationships between `n`, `a`, and `b`. The input values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution.
