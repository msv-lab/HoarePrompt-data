The code snippet only reads an integer `t` from the input. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases that will follow, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case are not yet read by the code snippet provided.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variable `t` is now assigned the value of the integer input. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain as described in the initial state but are not yet assigned specific values by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, a, and b such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.**
