To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the condition inside the `print` statement based on the given initial state.

### Variables and Conditions:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers.
3. `a` is a list of integers.
4. `b` is a list of integers.
5. `len_a` is the length of list `a`.
6. `len_b` is the length of list `b`.
7. `d` is defined as `k // 2` (integer division).
8. `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`.
9. `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`.
10. `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.

### Condition to be Evaluated:
The `print` statement will output 'YES' if both `count_a >= d` and `count_b >= d` are true. Otherwise, it will output 'NO'.

### Explanation:
- `d` is half of `k` (integer division, so it will be the floor of `k / 2`).
- `count_a` is the count of elements in list `a` that are less than or equal to `k`.
- `count_b` is the count of elements in list `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.

The condition checks if at least half of the elements in both lists `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `k`.

### Output:
The output will be either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether the counts `count_a` and `count_b` meet the condition `>= d`.

Given the information, we can't compute exact numerical values for `count_a`, `count_b`, `d`, or the lists `a` and `b`. However, we can describe the condition that needs to be satisfied for the output.

Output: **'YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d, otherwise 'NO' (where count_a is the number of elements in list a that are less than or equal to k, count_b is the number of elements in list b that are less than or equal to k, and d is k // 2)**
