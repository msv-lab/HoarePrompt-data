The code snippet assigns the value of `k // 2` to the variable `d`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers input by the user; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the next line of input; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the next line of input; `len_a` is the length of list `a`; `len_b` is the length of list `b`; `count_a` is 0; `count_b` is 0; `d` is `k // 2`.**
