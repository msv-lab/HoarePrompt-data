The code snippet provided assigns a new list `b` to the variable `b`, which is created by splitting the next line of input and converting each split string to an integer. This operation does not affect the initial variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state will include the new list `b` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers input by the user; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the next line of input; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the next line of input.**
