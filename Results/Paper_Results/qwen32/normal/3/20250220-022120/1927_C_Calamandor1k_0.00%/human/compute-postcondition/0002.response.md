The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. This value of `t` is not affected by the code snippet.

After the execution of the code, the output state includes the new values assigned to `n`, `m`, and `k`, while `t` retains its initial value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers input by the user.**
