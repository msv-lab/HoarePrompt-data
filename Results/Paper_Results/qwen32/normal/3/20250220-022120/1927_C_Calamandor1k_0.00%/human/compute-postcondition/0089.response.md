Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 < 10^4; `n`, `m`, `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a new list of integers read from the input; `len_a` is the length of the list `a` and must be at least 1 or `len_b` is the length of the new list `b` and must be at least 1; `d` is `k // 2`. If `len_b` is greater than `i + 1` and `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count_a` remains unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1.**
