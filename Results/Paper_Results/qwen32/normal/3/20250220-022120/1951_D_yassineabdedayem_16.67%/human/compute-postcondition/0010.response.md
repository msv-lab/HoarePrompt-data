The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`. Given the initial state, `Max` is equal to `k`, so `k - Max` results in `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is equal to `k`, `k` is 0, `rep` is 0, `number` is 1, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is 1, `Max` is the original value of `k`, and `n * Min` is less than or equal to the original value of `k`.**
