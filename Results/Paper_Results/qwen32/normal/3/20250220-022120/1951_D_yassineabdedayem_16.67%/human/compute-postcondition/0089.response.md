To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the given information and simulate the loop's behavior based on the provided conditions.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - `n` is the first integer read from input.
   - `k` is the second integer read from input.
   - `rep` is 0.
   - `tab` is an empty list.
   - `number` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - `while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:`

3. **Loop Body:**
   - `Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)`
   - If `Max == k and n * Min <= k`:
     - `number = Min`
     - `k = k - Max`
   - Else:
     - `number = Max`
     - `k = k - Min`
   - `tab.append(str(number))`
   - `n -= Min * Max`
   - `rep += 1`

4. **Output States after Iterations:**
   - **After 1 iteration:**
     - `t` is `t - 1`
     - `n` is 0
     - `k` is either 0 or 3
     - `rep` is 1
     - `tab` is a list containing either ['2'] or ['5']
     - `number` is either 2 or 5
     - `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5
   - **After 2 iterations:**
     - `t` is `t - 1`
     - `n` is `n - Min * Max`
     - `k` is greater than 0
     - `rep` is 2
     - `tab` is a list containing either ['2', str(number)] or ['5', str(number)]
     - `number` is either `Min` or `Max`
     - `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`
     - `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`
     - If `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, then `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - Min` and `number` is `Max`.
   - **After 3 iterations:**
     - `t` is `t - 1`
     - `n` is `n - 2 * Min * Max`
     - `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on whether `Max == k and n * Min <= k`
     - `rep` is 3
     - `tab` is a list containing either ['2', str(number), str(number)] or ['5', str(number), str(number)]
     - `number` is either `Min` or `Max`
     - `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`
     - `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`

### Simulation:
Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, let's assume the following:
- `n` was initially 10 and `k` was 5.
- After 1 iteration:
  - `Min = 2`, `Max = 5`
  - `number = 5`, `k = 0`, `n = 0`
  - `tab = ['5']`
- After 2 iterations is not possible because `n` is already 0 after the first iteration.

Since `n` becomes 0 after the first iteration, the loop terminates after the first iteration.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains `t - 1` (unchanged from the initial state).
- `n` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is 1.
- `tab` is `['5']`.
- `number` is 5.

### Conclusion:
Output State: **t is t - 1, n is 0, k is 0, rep is 1, tab is ['5'], number is 5.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, `t` remains decremented by 1, `n` becomes 0, `k` becomes 0, the loop has run once (`rep` is 1), the `tab` list contains the string '5', and `number` is 5.
