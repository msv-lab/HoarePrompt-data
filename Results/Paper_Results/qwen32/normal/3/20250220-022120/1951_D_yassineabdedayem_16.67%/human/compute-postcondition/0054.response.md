The code snippet `rep = 0` sets the variable `rep` to 0. This means the number of iterations the loop has executed is reset to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `tab` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer read from input, `k` is the second integer read from input, `rep` is 0, and `tab` is a list containing `rep` string representations of the values of numbers calculated in each iteration.**
