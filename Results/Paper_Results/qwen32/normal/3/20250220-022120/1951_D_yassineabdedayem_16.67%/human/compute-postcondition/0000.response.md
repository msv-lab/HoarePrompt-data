The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition specifies that `t` is initially an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. After executing the code, `t` will hold the value of the integer input provided, which will still satisfy the condition 1 <= t <= 1000. The other variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18.**
