The initial state provides us with the values and types of several variables. The variable `tab` is explicitly defined as a list containing two string elements, `'5'` and `'5'`. The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(len(tab))`, which will output the length of the list `tab`.

Since `tab` is a list with two elements, the length of `tab` is 2.

Output: **2**
