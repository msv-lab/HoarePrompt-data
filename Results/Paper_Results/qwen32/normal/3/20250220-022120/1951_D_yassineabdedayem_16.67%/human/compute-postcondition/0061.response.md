The code snippet `k = k - Max` modifies the value of `k` by subtracting the value of `Max` from it. Given the initial state, `k` is 5 and `Max` is also 5. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `k` becomes 0.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here's the output state:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is 10, `k` is 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is 2, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5, `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`**.

However, there is a discrepancy in the last condition since `Max` is no longer equal to `k` after the code execution. The correct output state should be:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is 10, `k` is 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is 2, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5, `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`**.

But since `Max` is no longer equal to `k` and `n * Min` is not less than or equal to `k` (as 10 * 2 is not less than or equal to 0), the final output state should reflect these changes accurately:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is 10, `k` is 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is 2, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5**.
