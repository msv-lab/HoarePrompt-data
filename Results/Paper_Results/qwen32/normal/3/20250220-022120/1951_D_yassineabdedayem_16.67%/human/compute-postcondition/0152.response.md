The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `k`, `number`) but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.
2. The string `'NO'` is a literal and does not depend on any variables.
3. The variables `t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `k`, and `number` are mentioned in the initial state but are not referenced in the `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
