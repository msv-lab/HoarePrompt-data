Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `rep` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is 1, `Max` is `k`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is set to 0 and `number` is set to 1. Otherwise, `k` is set to `k-1` and `number` is set to `k`.**

Explanation: The list `tab` now contains the string representation of `number`. All other variables retain their initial values unless `k` and `number` were modified by the conditional statement before the `tab.append(str(number))` line was executed.
