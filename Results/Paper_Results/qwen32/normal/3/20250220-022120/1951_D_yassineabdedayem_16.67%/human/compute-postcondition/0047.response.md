Let's break down the given initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n`: Initialized to 0.
- `k`: Initialized to 0.
- `rep`: The number of iterations the loop executed + 1.
- `tab`: A list containing at least `rep` string representations of a number.
- `i`: The element at index `rep - 1` in `tab`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `rep`**:
   - `rep` is defined as the number of iterations the loop executed + 1. This means that after the loop, `rep` holds the total number of iterations plus one.

2. **Value of `tab`**:
   - `tab` is a list containing at least `rep` string representations of a number. This implies that the list `tab` has at least `rep` elements.

3. **Value of `i`**:
   - `i` is defined as the element at index `rep - 1` in `tab`. Since `rep` is the number of iterations plus one, `rep - 1` will give us the last index of the list `tab` that was populated by the loop.

4. **Output of `print(i, end=' ')`**:
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - The value of `i` is the element at index `rep - 1` in `tab`, which is a string representation of a number.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be the string representation of the number at the last index of the list `tab` (which is `rep - 1`), followed by a space.

Output: **[i] (where i is the element at index rep - 1 in the tab list, which is a string representation of a number)**
