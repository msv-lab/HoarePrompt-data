To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the behavior and constraints of the loop provided. The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is not zero, `k` is greater than zero, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is at least `k`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can deduce that the loop modifies `n`, `k`, `rep`, and `tab` in each iteration. The loop calculates `Min` and `Max` based on the values of `n` and `k`, then updates `number`, `k`, `n`, and `rep`, and appends `number` to `tab`.

From the provided output states after the first three iterations, we see that the loop is decrementing `k` and `n` in each iteration, and the values of `Min` and `Max` are being calculated based on the current values of `n` and `k`.

The loop will terminate when one of the following conditions is met:
1. `n` becomes zero.
2. `k` becomes zero.
3. `rep` reaches 60.
4. `n` becomes less than `k`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, it appears that the loop continues to execute until `n` becomes zero or `k` becomes zero, as long as `rep` does not reach 60.

To determine the final output state, we need to consider the general behavior of the loop. Since `n` and `k` are being modified in each iteration, and the loop continues until `n` is zero or `k` is zero, we can infer that the loop will eventually terminate with either `n` or `k` being zero.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for `n` and `k`, we can assume that the loop will terminate with `n` becoming zero, as this is a common termination condition in such loops.

Therefore, the final output state will be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` becomes zero.
- `k` is a non-negative integer, potentially zero.
- `rep` is the number of iterations the loop executed, which is less than or equal to 60.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the values of `number` calculated in each iteration.

Given the constraints and the behavior of the loop, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is 0, k is a non-negative integer, rep is the number of iterations the loop executed (<= 60), tab is a list containing the string representations of the values of number calculated in each iteration.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is that `n` is zero, `k` is a non-negative integer, the loop has executed a certain number of times (up to 60), and `tab` contains the string representations of the numbers calculated during each iteration.
