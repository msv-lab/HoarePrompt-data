Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on whether `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing either `['2', str(number), str(number)]` or `['5', str(number), str(number)]`, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**

Natural language explanation: The list `tab` now contains an additional element, which is the string representation of `number`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
