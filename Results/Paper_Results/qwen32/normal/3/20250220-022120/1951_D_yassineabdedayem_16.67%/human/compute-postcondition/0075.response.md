Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing either ['2'] or ['5'], `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `n // k` and `k`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `number` is `Min`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - Min` and `number` is `Max`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block, taking into account the conditions and changes specified in both the if and else parts.
