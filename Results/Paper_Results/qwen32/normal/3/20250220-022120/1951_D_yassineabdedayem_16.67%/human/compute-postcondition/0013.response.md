Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18 - 1, `rep` is 0, `number` is `k`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is 1, `Max` is `k`. Either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by `Min` (which is 1), so `k` becomes `k - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
