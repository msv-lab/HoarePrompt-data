Let's analyze the given initial conditions and the code snippet:

- `t` is 1
- `n` is 10
- `rep` is 0
- `tab` is `[]`
- `Min` is 2
- `Max` is 5
- If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is 0 and `number` is 2. Otherwise, `k` is 3 and `number` is 5.

The code snippet is:
```
tab.append(str(number))
```

First, we need to determine the value of `number` based on the conditions provided:
- `Max` is 5, so `k` cannot be 5 (since `n * Min` is 20 which is greater than 5).
- Therefore, `k` is 3 and `number` is 5.

Now, the code appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. Since `number` is 5, `tab` will now be `['5']`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is 10, `rep` is 0, `tab` is `['5']`, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5, `number` is 5**.
