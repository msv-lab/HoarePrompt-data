The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `Min` from it. Given that `k` is initially 5 and `Min` is 2, `k` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is 10, `k` is 3, `rep` is 0, `tab` is `[]`, `number` is 5, `Min` is 2, `Max` is 5, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**.
