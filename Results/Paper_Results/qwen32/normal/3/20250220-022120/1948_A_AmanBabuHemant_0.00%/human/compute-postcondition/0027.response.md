Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 48.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `s` is the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward. It prints the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are not used in the print statement, so their values do not affect the output.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
