Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly generate the required string of uppercase Latin letters where there are exactly `n` special characters. Here are the issues:

1. **Output Format**: The problem requires the string to be composed of uppercase Latin letters (A-Z), but the program generates a string composed of '1', '1', and '0', which do not meet the output requirements.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Special Characters**: The program incorrectly assumes that `n` must be even to construct a valid string. This is not true. For example, a string like "AAAB" has 3 special characters ('A' at positions 1, 3, and 4), and `n` is odd.

3. **String Length Constraint**: The program uses the string '110' * (n // 2), which does not guarantee that the number of special characters will be exactly `n` and does not generate a valid string according to the problem description.

Let's consider a test case where the program fails:

- **Test Case**: `n = 3`
  - Expected Output:
    ```
    YES
    AAAB
    ```
  - Actual Output:
    ```
    NO
    ```

The program incorrectly outputs "NO" for `n = 3`, even though a valid string "AAAB" exists.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the problem description for all potential cases.
