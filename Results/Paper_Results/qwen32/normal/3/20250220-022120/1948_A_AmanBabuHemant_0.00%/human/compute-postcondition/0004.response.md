The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the values of `t` and `n`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
2. The initial state also specifies that `n` is an input integer and `n` is odd.
3. The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('NO')`.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` without referencing any variables, the output will be `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t` and `n`.

Output: **NO**
