Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` is an even integer.
- `s` is the string `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` is less than 200.

We need to determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement.

Let's break down the string `s`:
- Since `n` is even, `n // 2` is an integer.
- The string `s` is formed by repeating the substring `'110'` exactly `n // 2` times.

The exact value of `s` depends on the value of `n`, but we know it will be a sequence of `'110'` repeated `n // 2` times. 

For example:
- If `n = 2`, then `n // 2 = 1` and `s = '110'`.
- If `n = 4`, then `n // 2 = 2` and `s = '110110'`.
- If `n = 6`, then `n // 2 = 3` and `s = '110110110'`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can't provide the exact string `s`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Output: **s (where s is the string '110' repeated n // 2 times)**
