Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50. `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

Natural Language: The variable `t` is now assigned the integer value provided by the user input, which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 50 inclusive. The precondition for `n` in the test cases remains unchanged.
