The provided Python code snippet only sets the recursion limit using `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)`. This does not affect any variables or the input data directly. It only changes the system setting related to recursion depth, allowing the program to handle deeper recursive calls if needed.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n (3 ≤ n ≤ m) and m (m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5)), representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. The following m lines each contain three integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v), and w (1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6), representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. There is at most one edge between each pair of vertices, and the graph does not contain loops. The sum of the values of m for all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5. The recursion limit has been set to 1,000,000.**
