The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends two characters from the string `s` to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 3 and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `s[x]` refers to the character at index 3, which is 'D'. Therefore, `s[x] * 2` results in 'DD'. This is appended to `ans`, which originally is 'AAABBBCC'. 

After the execution, `ans` becomes 'AAABBBCCDD'. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 7 and not divisible by 2, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 'AAABBBCCDD', `x` is 3, `j` is 3**.
