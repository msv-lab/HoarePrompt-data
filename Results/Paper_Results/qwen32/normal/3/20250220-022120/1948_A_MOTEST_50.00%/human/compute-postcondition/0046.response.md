The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` will concatenate to the string `ans` the character at index `x` in the string `s`, repeated twice. Given that `x` is 1 and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', the character at index 1 is 'B'. Therefore, 'BB' will be appended to `ans`.

Here are the changes:
- `ans` was 'AA' and now it becomes 'AABB'.
- Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 'AABB', `x` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1**.
