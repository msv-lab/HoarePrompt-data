The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `t`, `i`, `s`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 5, `j` is 1, `t`, `i`, `s` are not in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, `x` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + s[x] * 2`.
