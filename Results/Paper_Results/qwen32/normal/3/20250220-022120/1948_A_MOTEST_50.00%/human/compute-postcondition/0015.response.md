The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends to the string `ans` the character at index `x` in the string `s`, repeated twice. Given that `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `x` is 1, and `ans` is initially 'AA', the character at index `x` in `s` is 'B'. Therefore, 'B' repeated twice is 'BB', which is appended to `ans`. The new value of `ans` becomes 'AABB'. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AABB', `x` is 1, `j` is the value of `j` from the previous iteration plus 1**.
