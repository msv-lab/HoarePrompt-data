The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` concatenates to `ans` the character at index `x` in the string `s`, repeated twice. Given the initial state, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `x` is 2, the character at index 2 is 'C'. Therefore, 'CC' is concatenated to `ans`.

Initial `ans` is 'AABB', so after the operation, `ans` becomes 'AABBCC'.

The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AABBCC', `x` is 2, `j` is the value of `j` from the previous iteration plus 1**.
