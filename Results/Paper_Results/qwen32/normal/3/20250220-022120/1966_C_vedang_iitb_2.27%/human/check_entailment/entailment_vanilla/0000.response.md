Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The game revolves around piles of stones and players taking turns to remove stones from each non-empty pile. The number of stones removed must be a positive integer and cannot exceed the smallest pile size. The player who cannot make a move loses.

The key to solving this problem is understanding the game's mechanics and how to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the piles.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

#### Function `func_1`

This function appears to process the list of pile sizes by first removing duplicates and then sorting. It then calculates the differences between consecutive sorted unique pile sizes. However, this transformation doesn't directly help in determining the winner based on the game rules.

#### Function `func_2`

This function attempts to determine the winner recursively. It handles special cases for 1 and 2 piles separately. For more than 2 piles, it recursively determines the winner for the remaining piles and then uses this information to decide the winner for the current configuration.

However, the logic in `func_2` does not correctly determine the winner based on the game rules. Specifically:

1. **Base Cases**: The base cases for 1 and 2 piles seem to be incorrect or incomplete.
2. **Recursive Case**: The recursive case does not correctly handle the game mechanics. It doesn't consider the optimal moves based on the game rules.

### Correct Solution Approach

The correct approach to solve this problem involves the concept of the Nim game, specifically the Grundy number (or Nim-sum) for each pile size. The Grundy number for a pile of size `x` is `x` itself. The overall game state can be determined by the XOR (exclusive OR) of the Grundy numbers of all piles. If the XOR result is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy; otherwise, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the winner based on the game rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
