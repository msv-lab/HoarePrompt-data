Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50 and `n` is not equal to 2; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= n and `p_i` != i; `v` is a list of n + 1 integers, where the first integer is 0 and the remaining integers are the values provided in the input.**
