Output State: **The program does not return any value.**

Explanation: The provided Python code snippet only contains a `return` statement without any specific value or variable specified. Therefore, the program will return `None` by default, but since the task specifies to mention if a value or variable has been returned, and no value is explicitly returned, the output state reflects that no return action occurs.
