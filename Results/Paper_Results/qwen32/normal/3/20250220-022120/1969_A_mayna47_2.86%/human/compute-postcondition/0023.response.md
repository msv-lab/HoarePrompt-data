Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers `p` from the input, then prints either `2` or `3` based on a specific condition. If `n` is `2`, it prints `2`. Otherwise, it checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`; if such an index exists, it prints `2` and exits. If no such index is found after checking all possible indices, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value.**
