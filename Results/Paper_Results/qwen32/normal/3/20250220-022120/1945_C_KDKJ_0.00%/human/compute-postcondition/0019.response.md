Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x+1, y]]` where `x` and `y` are determined by the value of `s` (the next character in `a`) and `a` as described above, `s` is the next character in `a`, `x` is the value of `x` from the last sublist of `S` plus 1, `y` is the value of `y` from the last sublist of `S`.**

In simple terms, the value of `x` in the last sublist of `S` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
