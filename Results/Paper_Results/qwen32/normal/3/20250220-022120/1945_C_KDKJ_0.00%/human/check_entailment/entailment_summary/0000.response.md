### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the optimal position to place a road dividing a village of `n` houses into two sides such that:
     - At least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side of the street.
     - The road should be as close to the middle of the village as possible.
     - If there are multiple suitable positions, the smallest one should be chosen.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` processes a single test case.
   - It reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.
   - It constructs a list `S` where each element `S[i]` is a pair `[x, y]` representing the cumulative count of '0's and '1's up to the `i-th` house.
   - It then iterates through each potential position `i` to check if placing the road after the `i-th` house satisfies the condition:
     - At least half of the residents on the left side (`left * 2 < lsum`) are satisfied.
     - At least half of the residents on the right side (`right * 2 < rsum`) are satisfied.
   - It keeps track of the position `ans` that is closest to `n / 2` and satisfies the condition.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` is the main function that handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Verification:**
   - The execution summary for `func_1` correctly describes the logic for determining the optimal position for the road.
   - The execution summary for `func_2` correctly describes how multiple test cases are handled.
   - Both functions align with the problem description and ensure that all test cases are processed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` together handle the input and output requirements efficiently.

**Correctness: True**
