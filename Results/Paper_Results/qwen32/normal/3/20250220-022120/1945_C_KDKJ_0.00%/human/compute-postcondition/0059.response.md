Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. It calculates and prints an index `i` that is closest to `n / 2` and satisfies the condition where the number of '0's on the left of `i` is at least half of the total characters to the left of `i`, and the number of '1's on the right of `i` is at least half of the total characters to the right of `i`.**
