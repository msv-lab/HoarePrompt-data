The code snippet provided updates the value of `rsum` based on the current value of `lsum` and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a string provided by the user input, `S` is a list of `[x, y]` pairs where the first element is `[0, 0]` and each subsequent element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative counts of `'0'`s and non-`'0'`s up to that character in the string `a`, `ans` is either the original `ans` or `i` depending on the condition, `satisfy` is 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - lsum`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `rsum` is now calculated as `n - lsum`. All other variables retain their previous values.
