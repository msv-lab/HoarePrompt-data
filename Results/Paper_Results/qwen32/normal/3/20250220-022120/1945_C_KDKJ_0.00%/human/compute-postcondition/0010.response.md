Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`. If `a` is `'0'`, then `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`. Otherwise, `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`.**

This means that the list `S` now contains two elements: the initial `[0, 0]` and a new element `[x, y]` which is determined by the value of `a`. The values of `x` and `y` remain as specified based on the condition of `a`.
