Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to place a road between two houses in a village such that the number of residents satisfied on each side of the road is at least half of the residents on that side. The road should be placed as close to the middle of the village as possible.

### Solution Analysis

The solution consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function handles a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

Let's break down `func_1()`:

1. **Input Reading and Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The function reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences.
   - It initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]` (representing the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far).
   - It iterates through the string `a`, updating the prefix sums for 0s and 1s and appending them to `S`.

2. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - The function initializes `ans` to 0 (the position of the road) and `satisfy` to 0 (a variable that is not used in the function).
   - It iterates through each possible position `i` (from 0 to `n-1`) to determine if placing the road after the `i-th` house satisfies the condition.
   - For each position `i`, it calculates:
     - `left`: The number of 0s to the left of the road.
     - `lsum`: The total number of houses to the left of the road.
     - `right`: The number of 1s to the right of the road.
     - `rsum`: The total number of houses to the right of the road.
   - It checks if the number of 0s to the left is at least half of the houses to the left and if the number of 1s to the right is at least half of the houses to the right.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it checks if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position `ans`. If it is, it updates `ans`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the optimal position `ans`.

### Correctness

- The solution correctly calculates the prefix sums for 0s and 1s.
- It correctly checks the conditions for each possible position `i`.
- It correctly updates the optimal position `ans` based on the conditions and the distance to the middle of the village.
- The solution handles multiple test cases correctly by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

### Conclusion

The solution appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
