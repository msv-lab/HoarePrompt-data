The code snippet `x, y = S[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `S` to the variables `x` and `y`. Given the initial state, the last element of `S` is `[x, y]`. Since `S[-1]` is `[x, y]`, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated to match the values in the last element of `S`.

The initial state specifies that if `a` is `'0'`, then `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`. Otherwise, `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`. Therefore, after executing the code, the values of `x` and `y` will be consistent with this condition.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`. If `a` is `'0'`, then `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`. Otherwise, `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`. `s` is the next character in the string `a`. `x` is `1` if `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `0`. `y` is `0` if `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `y` is `1`.**
