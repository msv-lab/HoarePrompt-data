To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the function calls involved. The loop is controlled by the number of test cases provided as input, and it calls `func_1()` for each test case.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute `func_1()` for each test case specified by the initial input. The loop will terminate once all test cases have been processed.

**Output State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to the number of test cases; `func_1()` has been called for each of the test cases specified by the input integer.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will run as many times as the number of test cases provided in the input, and for each test case, the function `func_1()` will be called once. The loop will terminate after all test cases have been processed.
