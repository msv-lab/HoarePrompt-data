You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a
big road that will divide the village into left and right sides. Each resident
wants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is
described as a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident
of the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,
a_j = 1 .

The road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be
declared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the
right-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then
the houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the
street, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road
also may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the
entire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.

To make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half
of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.
That is, among x residents on one side, at least \lceil\frac{x}{2}\rceil
should want to live on that side, where \lceil x \rceil denotes rounding up a
real number x .

To the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j
there must be at least \lceil\frac{i}{2}\rceil zeros. To the right of the
road, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at
least \lceil\frac{n-i}{2}\rceil ones.

Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the
described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.
Formally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \left|\frac{n}{2} -
i\right| .

If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \left|\frac{n}{2}
- i\right| , output the smaller one.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le
3\cdot 10^5 ). The next line of each test case contains a string a of length n
, consisting only of 0 and 1 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number i — the position of the house after
which the road should be laid (if it should be laid before the first house,
output 0 ). We can show that the answer always exists.

Note

Let's consider the first example of input data.

If we lay the road after the first house, there will be one house a_1 = 1 on
the left side of the street, the resident of which would like to live on the
right side of the street. Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be
satisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after
house 1 .

If we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left
side (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the
right side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice. More
than half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which
means that the road can be laid after house 2 . We can show that this is the
optimal answer.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases from the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1`. It does not return any value explicitly but performs actions based on the details of each test case provided through the input.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the road should be laid before the first house (i.e., `i = 0`) or after the last house (i.e., `i = n`). The code currently only considers laying the road between houses, but it does not check the conditions for `i = 0` and `i = n`.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

### Example:
Input:
```
1
3
001
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Explanation:
- If the road is laid before the first house (`i = 0`), there are no houses on the left side, and all three houses are on the right side. Since there are 3 houses on the right side, at least `ceil(3/2) = 2` of them should want to live on the right side, which is true because there are 2 zeros and 1 one.
- If the road is laid after the third house (`i = 3`), there are no houses on the right side, and all three houses are on the left side. Since there are 3 houses on the left side, at least `ceil(3/2) = 2` of them should want to live on the left side, which is true because there are 2 zeros and 1 one.
- If the road is laid after the first house (`i = 1`), there is 1 house on the left side, and 2 houses on the right side. The left side condition is satisfied because there is 1 zero and `ceil(1/2) = 1`. The right side condition is not satisfied because there is 1 one and `ceil(2/2) = 2`.
- If the road is laid after the second house (`i = 2`), there are 2 houses on the left side, and 1 house on the right side. The left side condition is not satisfied because there are 2 zeros and `ceil(2/2) = 2`. The right side condition is satisfied because there is 1 one and `ceil(1/2) = 1`.

The correct answer should be `0` because it is the closest position to the middle of the village that satisfies the conditions. However, the provided code does not check the conditions for `i = 0` and `i = n`, so it will not return `0` in this case.

To fix this, the code should explicitly check the conditions for `i = 0` and `i = n` and compare them with the other possible positions.
