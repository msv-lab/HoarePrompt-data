Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of houses in the village (where 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5), and `a`, a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The function returns the number of houses that are considered "lonely" based on the given criteria. A house is considered "lonely" if it is represented by '1' and is not adjacent to any other house represented by '1'.**
