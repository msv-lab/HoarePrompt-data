The code snippet assigns the value `n - lsum` to the variable `rsum`. Here, `n` is the total length of the string `a` provided by the user, and `lsum` is the sum of the cumulative counts of `'0'`s and non-`'0'`s up to the `i`-th character in the string `a`. 

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `S`, `ans`, `satisfy`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a string provided by the user input, `S` is a list of `[x, y]` pairs where the first element is `[0, 0]` and each subsequent element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative counts of `'0'`s and non-`'0'`s up to that character in the string `a`, `ans` is 0, `satisfy` is 0, `left` is the cumulative count of `'0'`s up to the `i`-th character in the string `a`, `lsum` is the sum of `S[i][0]` and `S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - lsum`.**
