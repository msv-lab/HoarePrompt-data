Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is a string provided by the user input, `S` is a list of `[x, y]` pairs where the first element is `[0, 0]` and each subsequent element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative counts of `'0'`s and non-`'0'`s up to that character in the string `a`, `ans` is 0, `satisfy` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - lsum
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a string provided by the user input, `S` is a list of `[x, y]` pairs where the first element is `[0, 0]` and each subsequent element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative counts of `'0'`s and non-`'0'`s up to that character in the string `a`, `ans` is either the original `ans` or `i` depending on the condition, `satisfy` is 0, `left` is the cumulative count of `'0'`s up to the `i`-th character in the string `a`, `lsum` is the sum of `S[i][0]` and `S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - lsum`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the current values of `left` and `right` satisfy these conditions. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a string provided by the user input, `S` is a list of `[x, y]` pairs where the first element is `[0, 0]` and each subsequent element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative counts of `'0'`s and non-`'0'`s up to that character in the string `a`. `ans` is either the original `ans` or `i` depending on the condition. `satisfy` remains 0. `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, and `rsum` is `n - lsum`. `i` is `i_prev + 1`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, the condition is met but `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is updated to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a string provided by the user input, `S` is a list of `[x, y]` pairs where the first element is `[0, 0]` and each subsequent element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative counts of `'0'`s and non-`'0'`s up to that character in the string `a`, `satisfy` remains 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - lsum`. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, then no change is made to `ans`. Otherwise, if `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
