### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the optimal position to build a road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side, and the road is as close to the middle of the village as possible.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and the correctness of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (the number of houses) and a string `a` (the preferences of the residents).
   - It then calls `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Cumulative Counts**:
   - `S` is initialized as `[[0, 0]]`. This list will store cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position in the string `a`.
   - For each character in `a`, the program updates the counts of '0's and '1's and appends the updated counts to `S`.

3. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - The program iterates over possible positions `i` where the road could be built.
   - For each position `i`:
     - It calculates `left`, the number of '0's to the left of the road.
     - It calculates `lsum`, the total number of houses to the left of the road.
     - It calculates `right`, the number of '1's to the right of the road.
     - It calculates `rsum`, the total number of houses to the right of the road.
   - It checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the total houses on the left (`left * 2 >= lsum`), and the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the total houses on the right (`right * 2 >= rsum`).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it checks if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position (`ans`). If so, it updates `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - After evaluating all possible positions, the program prints the position `ans` that is closest to the middle of the village and satisfies the conditions.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It efficiently calculates the cumulative counts and checks the conditions for each possible position, ensuring that the road is placed as close to the middle as possible while satisfying the constraints. The use of cumulative counts allows the program to compute the number of '0's and '1's on each side in constant time for each position, making the solution efficient.

**Correctness: True**
