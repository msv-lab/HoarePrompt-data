Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which is not necessarily the correct default value. If the road should be laid before the first house (i.e., `ans = 0`), this initialization is fine, but if there is a better position, it should be updated correctly. However, the main problem is that the initial check for `ans` should consider if the condition is met for `ans = 0`.

2. **Updating `ans`**: The condition `elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):` should be `elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans) or (abs(n / 2 - i) == abs(n / 2 - ans) and i < ans):`. This ensures that we choose the smaller `i` when the distances to the middle are equal.

3. **Loop Range**: The loop should iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n` inclusive. The current loop `for i in range(n):` only goes up to `n-1`, which means it does not check the possibility of laying the road after the last house.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        (x, y) = S[-1]
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        S.append([x, y])
    ans = -1
    satisfy = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        left = S[i][0]
        lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]
        right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
        rsum = n - lsum
        if left * 2 >= lsum and right * 2 >= rsum:
            if ans == -1 or abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans) or (abs(n / 2 - i) == abs(n / 2 - ans) and i < ans):
                ans = i
    print(ans)
```

And the `func_2` function should remain the same:

```python
def func_2():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
```

With these corrections, the program should correctly determine the optimal position for the road.
