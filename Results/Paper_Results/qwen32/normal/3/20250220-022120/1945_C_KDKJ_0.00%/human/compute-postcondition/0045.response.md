Postcondition: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a string provided by the user input, `S` is a list of `[x, y]` pairs where the first element is `[0, 0]` and each subsequent element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative counts of `'0'`s and non-`'0'`s up to that character in the string `a`. If `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is updated to `i`. `satisfy` remains 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, and `rsum` is `n - lsum`. `i` is `i_prev + 1`. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged.**
