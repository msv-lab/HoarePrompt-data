The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the input to the `range` function. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `x` is `t` where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and `y` is `t // 2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the input to `range` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is `t` where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `y` is `t // 2`**
