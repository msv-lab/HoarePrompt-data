Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer \( x \). Then, it calculates \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) and prints \( y \).

### Correctness Evaluation:
To evaluate the correctness, we need to determine if \( y = x // 2 \) always results in a \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

#### Case Analysis:
1. **Small Values of \( x \):**
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1. \(\gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\).
   - For \( x = 3 \), the possible \( y \) values are 1 and 2. \(\gcd(3, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\) and \(\gcd(3, 2) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3\). Here, \( y = 2 \) is optimal.
   - For \( x = 4 \), possible \( y \) values are 1, 2, and 3. \(\gcd(4, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\), \(\gcd(4, 2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4\), and \(\gcd(4, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4\). Here, \( y = 2 \) and \( y = 3 \) are optimal.
   
2. **General Case:**
   - For larger values of \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). For example, consider \( x = 10 \):
     - Possible \( y \) values are 1 to 9.
     - \(\gcd(10, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\)
     - \(\gcd(10, 2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4\)
     - \(\gcd(10, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4\)
     - \(\gcd(10, 4) + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6\)
     - \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\)
     - \(\gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8\)
     - \(\gcd(10, 7) + 7 = 1 + 7 = 8\)
     - \(\gcd(10, 8) + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10\)
     - \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\)
   
   Here, \( y = 5, 8, 9 \) all maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\), but the program outputs \( y = 5 \), which is correct for this case, but not necessarily for all cases.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( x = 100 \), the program outputs \( y = 50 \). We need to check if there's a better \( y \):
     - \(\gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100\)
     - \(\gcd(100, 99) + 99 = 1 + 99 = 100\)
     - \(\gcd(100, 98) + 98 = 2 + 98 = 100\)
     - \(\gcd(100, 97) + 97 = 1 + 97 = 98\)
     - \(\gcd(100, 96) + 96 = 4 + 96 = 100\)
   
   Here, \( y = 50, 98, 99, 96 \) all maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\), but the program outputs \( y = 50 \), which is correct for this case, but not necessarily for all cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee to find the optimal \( y \) for all values of \( x \). While it may work for some cases, it does not always provide the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the program is not correct in general.

**Correctness: False**
