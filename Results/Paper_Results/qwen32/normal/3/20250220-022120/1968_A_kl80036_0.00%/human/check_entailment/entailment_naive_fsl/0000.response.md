Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always find the integer \( y \) (1 \(\le\) \( y \) < \( x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximum possible. The program simply selects \( y = x // 2 \), which does not guarantee the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Let's consider a few test cases to demonstrate this:

1. For \( x = 10 \):
   - The program outputs \( y = 5 \).
   - \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).
   - However, \( y = 9 \) gives \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\), which is also correct, but \( y = 6 \) gives \(\gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8\), which is less than 10.
   - While \( y = 5 \) is a valid solution, it is not guaranteed to be the optimal one for all cases.

2. For \( x = 7 \):
   - The program outputs \( y = 3 \).
   - \(\gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4\).
   - However, \( y = 6 \) gives \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\), which is better.

3. For \( x = 21 \):
   - The program outputs \( y = 10 \).
   - \(\gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11\).
   - However, \( y = 18 \) gives \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21\), which is better.

In these examples, the program does not always find the \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
