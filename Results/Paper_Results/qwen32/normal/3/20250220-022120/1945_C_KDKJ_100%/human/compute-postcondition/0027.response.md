The code snippet `lsum = i` assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `lsum`. No other variables are affected by this statement. Therefore, the value of `S`, `ans`, `n`, and `left` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y] after processing all characters in a; `ans` is -1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `left` is the x-coordinate of the `i`-th element in `S`; `lsum` is `i`.**
