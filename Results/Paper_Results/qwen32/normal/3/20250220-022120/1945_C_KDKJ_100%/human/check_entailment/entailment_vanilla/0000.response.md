Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find a position `i` to place the road such that:
1. Among the `i` houses to the left, at least `ceil(i/2)` have `a_j = 0`.
2. Among the `n-i` houses to the right, at least `ceil((n-i)/2)` have `a_j = 1`.
3. The position `i` should be as close to the middle of the village as possible, i.e., minimize `|n/2 - i|`.
4. If there are multiple such positions, choose the smallest one.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of two functions:
- `func_1()`: This function handles a single test case.
- `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_1()`

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `n` is the number of houses.
   - `a` is the string of preferences.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - `S` is a list of lists where `S[i]` stores the number of `0`s and `1`s from the start of the string up to the `i-1`th character.
   - This is achieved by iterating through the string `a` and updating the counts accordingly.

3. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - `ans` is initialized to `-1` to signify that no valid position has been found yet.
   - The program iterates over all possible positions `i` from `0` to `n` (inclusive).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates:
     - `left`: The number of `0`s to the left of the road.
     - `lsum`: The total number of houses to the left of the road.
     - `right`: The number of `1`s to the right of the road.
     - `rsum`: The total number of houses to the right of the road.
   - It checks if the conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` are satisfied. If either condition is true, it means that the current position `i` is not valid.
   - If the conditions are met, it checks if the current position `i` is closer to `n/2` than the previously found position `ans`. If it is, `ans` is updated to `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the position `ans` after the loop.

### Correctness Check

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum calculation is correct and efficiently keeps track of the number of `0`s and `1`s up to each position.
- **Condition Checking**: The conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` correctly check if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side.
- **Optimal Position Selection**: The program correctly minimizes `|n/2 - i|` and selects the smallest valid position in case of ties.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house by initializing `ans` to `-1` and updating it accordingly.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
