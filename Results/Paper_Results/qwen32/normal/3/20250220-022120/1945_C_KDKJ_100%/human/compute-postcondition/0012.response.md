The code snippet `x, y = S[-1]` assigns the values of the last element in the list `S` to the variables `x` and `y`. Given that `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`, the last element of `S` is `[x, y]`. Therefore, the values of `x` and `y` will be the same as the values of the last element in `S`.

Since the initial state specifies that `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]` where `x` is `1` and `y` is `0` if the first character of `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`, the values of `x` and `y` after executing the code will be `1` and `0` if the first character of `a` is `'0'`, and `0` and `1` otherwise.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`, where `x` is `1` and `y` is `0` if the first character of `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`, `s` is the next character in the string `a`, `x` is `1` and `y` is `0` if the first character of `a` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `0` and `y` is `1`**.
