To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the pattern described in the problem.

From the provided information:
1. **First Iteration**: `n` is a positive integer doubled.
2. **Second Iteration**: `n` is a positive integer doubled minus 1.
3. **Third Iteration**: `n` is a positive integer doubled minus 1, and the next input to `int(input())` must be one more than the current iteration count.

The loop runs for a number of times equal to the input value. Let's denote the input value by `k`. From the given pattern, it is clear that `n` is a positive integer doubled minus 1 after the first iteration, and this pattern continues.

The key point is that the value of `n` after the loop finishes will be dependent on the final iteration. If the loop runs `k` times, the value of `n` after the last iteration will be a positive integer doubled minus 1.

Since the function `func_2` does not affect the variables described and is not directly related to the variables in the loop, we only need to focus on the value of `n` after the loop finishes.

If the loop runs `k` times, `n` after the last iteration will be a positive integer doubled minus 1. However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified and the only consistent pattern is that it follows the rule of being doubled and then subtracted by 1 after the first iteration, we can generalize that the final state of `n` will follow this pattern.

Given that the problem does not specify the exact initial value of `n` or how it changes within `func_1`, we can infer that the final state of `n` after `k` iterations will be consistent with the pattern described.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be described as:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer doubled minus 1 after the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `n` will be a positive integer doubled and then subtracted by 1, following the established pattern.
