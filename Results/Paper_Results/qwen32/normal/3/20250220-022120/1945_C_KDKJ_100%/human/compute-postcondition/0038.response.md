Output State: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y] after processing all characters in `a`; `ans` is either -1 or the value of `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is the x-coordinate of the `i`-th element in `S`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`. If `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`, `ans` remains -1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `left` has been updated to the x-coordinate of the `i`-th element in the list `S`. All other variables remain unchanged.
