Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least one character, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y]]`, where `x` is `2` and `y` is `0` if the first character of `a` is `'0'` and `s` is `'0'`, `x` is `1` and `y` is `1` if the first character of `a` is `'0'` and `s` is not `'0'`, `x` is `0` and `y` is `2` if the first character of `a` is not `'0'` and `s` is `'0'`, otherwise `x` is `1` and `y` is `1`. `s` is the next character in the string `a`.**
