The code snippet `left = S[i][0]` updates the value of `left` to be the x-coordinate of the `i`-th element in the list `S`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, `left` was previously defined as the x-coordinate of the `i`-th element in `S`. After executing the code, `left` retains this definition but is explicitly updated to `S[i][0]`.

Output State: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y] after processing all characters in `a`, `ans` is `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
