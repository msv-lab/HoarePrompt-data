To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_1()` and how it affects the variables. However, the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided initial state or code snippet. For the purpose of this exercise, we'll assume that `func_1()` does not modify any variables or has no side effects on the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Given that `func_1()` does not affect the variables, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **The input to the function must be a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer doubled minus 1.**
