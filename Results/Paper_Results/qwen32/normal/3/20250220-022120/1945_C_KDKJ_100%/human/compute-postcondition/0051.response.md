The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables; it merely moves the control to the next iteration of the loop.

Given that, none of the variables `S`, `ans`, `n`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`, or `i` are modified by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y]; `ans` is `i` if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The state remains unchanged as the `continue` statement does not alter any variable values. The loop will proceed to the next iteration without making any changes to the variables.
