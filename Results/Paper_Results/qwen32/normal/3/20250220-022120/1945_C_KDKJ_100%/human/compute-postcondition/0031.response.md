Output State: **`S` is a list of coordinates starting from [0, 0] and ending with [x, y] after processing all characters in a; `ans` is -1; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is the x-coordinate of the `i`-th element in `S`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`; either `left * 2` is less than `lsum` or `right * 2` is less than `rsum`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values and conditions.
