To complete this task, we need more information about the function `func_1()`. The provided code snippet only calls the function `func_1()` without any context about what this function does. If you can provide the definition of `func_1()`, I can accurately simulate its execution and provide the output state.

For now, I will assume a hypothetical definition for `func_1()` to illustrate how the response should be structured. Let's assume `func_1()` is defined as follows:

```python
def func_1():
    global n
    n = n * 2
    return n
```

Given this hypothetical definition, let's proceed with the task.

Initial State: The input to the function must be a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer

```
func_1()
```

Impact of the code:
- The function `func_1()` is called.
- Inside `func_1()`, the global variable `n` is doubled.
- The function returns the new value of `n`.

Output State: **The input to the function must be a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer doubled.**

If you provide the actual definition of `func_1()`, I can give you the precise output state based on that.
