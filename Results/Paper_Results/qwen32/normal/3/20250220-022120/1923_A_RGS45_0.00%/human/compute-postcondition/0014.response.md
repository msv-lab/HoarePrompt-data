To determine the output of the `print(z.count('0'))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and how the variables are defined.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer representing the number of test cases, where `t >= 2`.
2. **n**: An integer input.
3. **arr**: A string input.
4. **x**: The index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
5. **y**: The index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
6. **z**: A substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Finding `x`**:
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
   - If '1' is not found, `x` is -1.

2. **Finding `y`**:
   - `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`.
   - If '1' is not found, `y` is -1.
   - Note: In the reversed array, `y` is the index of the first '1' from the end. To convert it to the index in the original array, we use `n - 1 - y`.

3. **Constructing `z`**:
   - `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.
   - If `x` or `y` is -1, the exact substring `z` cannot be determined without the specific values of `arr`, `n`, `x`, and `y`.

4. **Counting '0's in `z`**:
   - The `print(z.count('0'))` statement will print the number of '0's in the substring `z`.

### Conclusion:
The exact value of `z` depends on the specific values of `arr`, `n`, `x`, and `y`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

- **If `arr` contains at least one '1'**:
  - `x` and `y` will be valid indices.
  - `z` will be a substring starting from the first '1' to the position determined by `n - y`.
  - The output will be the count of '0's in this substring.

- **If `arr` does not contain '1'**:
  - `x` and `y` will be -1.
  - The substring `z` would be undefined based on the given formula, but we can assume it would be an empty string or some default behavior.

Given the problem constraints and the information provided, the output is best described as:

Output: **z.count('0') (where z is the substring of arr from index x to n - y)**
