Output State: **The loop has completed all `t` iterations. For each iteration, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, and `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`. The number of '0's in `z` is printed for each test case.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished processing all test cases specified by `t`. For each test case, it calculates the number of '0's between the first '1' from the start and the last '1' from the end in the string `arr`, and prints this count.
