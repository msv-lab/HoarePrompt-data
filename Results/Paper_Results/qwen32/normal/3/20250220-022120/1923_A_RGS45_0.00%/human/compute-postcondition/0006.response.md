To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the impact of the code `z = arr[x:n - y]` on the given initial state.

Given:
- `t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is an input string.
- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.
- `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found.

When `z = arr[x:n - y]` is executed:
- `z` is assigned the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` up to (but not including) index `n - y`.

The new variable `z` is introduced and assigned a value based on the existing variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is an input string; `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found; `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.**

In simpler terms:
- The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged.
- The integer `n` remains unchanged.
- The string `arr` remains unchanged.
- The index `x` remains unchanged.
- The index `y` remains unchanged.
- A new variable `z` is created and assigned the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` up to (but not including) index `n - y`.
