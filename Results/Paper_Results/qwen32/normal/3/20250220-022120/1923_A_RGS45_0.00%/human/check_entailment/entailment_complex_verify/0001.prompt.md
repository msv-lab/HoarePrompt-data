You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), where a_i = 0 means the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 means the i-th cell contains a chip. It is guaranteed that in each test case, there is at least one cell containing a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The loop has completed all `t` iterations. For each iteration, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the input string, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, and `z` is the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`. The number of '0's in `z` is printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of cells, some of which contain chips (represented by 1) and some of which are free (represented by 0). For each test case, the function calculates and prints the number of free cells between the first and last chip in the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to move the chips to form a single contiguous block with the minimum number of operations. Each operation allows moving a chip to the closest free cell to its left.

### Program Analysis
The provided program seems to have a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the input correctly, taking the number of test cases and then for each test case, the number of cells `n` and the configuration of the ribbon `arr`.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chips**:
   - The program correctly identifies the position of the first chip (`x`) and the last chip (`y`) in the ribbon using `find('1')` and `find('1')` on the reversed string, respectively.
   - However, `y` is calculated as `arr[::-1].find('1')`, which gives the position from the right. To get the actual position from the left, you need to subtract this value from `n - 1`.

3. **Counting Free Cells Between First and Last Chip**:
   - The program then tries to count the number of free cells (`0`s) between the first and last chip using `arr[x:n - y]`.
   - This slicing is incorrect because `n - y` does not give the correct position of the last chip from the start of the string. The correct position would be `n - 1 - y`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the count of `0`s between the first and last chip, which is intended to be the minimum number of operations required. However, due to the incorrect calculation of the last chip's position, this count might be incorrect.

### Correctness
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
