t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers a_i where each a_i is either 0 or 1, representing the state of the i-th cell (0 for free, 1 for occupied by a chip). In each test case, there is at least one cell that contains a chip (i.e., at least one a_i is 1).
