Precondition: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), where a_i = 0 means the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 means the i-th cell contains a chip. It is guaranteed that in each test case, there is at least one cell containing a chip.**
