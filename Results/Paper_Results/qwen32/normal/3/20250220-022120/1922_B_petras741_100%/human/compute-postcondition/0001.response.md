The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `buffer`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `buffer` is an empty list.**
