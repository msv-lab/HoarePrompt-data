Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` remains greater than or equal to 1; `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` remains an empty list; `w` remains a list of integers provided by the new input; `i` remains `i + 1`; `q` remains a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `w`; `eta` contains all indices `j` (from `0` to `n`) for which `q[j] > 0`; `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` equals 1, `rho` is assigned the value of `q[eta[0]]`. If `eta_ln` is greater than or equal to 2, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` from `0` to `eta_ln - 1` and `res` is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` from `1` to `eta_ln - 1`.**
