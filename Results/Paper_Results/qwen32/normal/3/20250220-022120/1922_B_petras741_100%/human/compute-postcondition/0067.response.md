The code snippet `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given the initial state, `eta` is either an empty list or a list containing a single element `j` if `n` >= 3 and `q[j] > 0`. After executing the code, `eta` will have the value of `j` appended to it, regardless of its previous state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `buffer` is an empty list; `w` is a list of integers provided by the new input; `i` is `i + 1`; `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in `w`; if `n` >= 3 and `q[j] > 0`, `eta` is a list containing the single element `j` plus the newly appended `j`. If `n` < 3 or `q[j] <= 0`, `eta` contains the newly appended `j`; `j` is `j + 1`**
