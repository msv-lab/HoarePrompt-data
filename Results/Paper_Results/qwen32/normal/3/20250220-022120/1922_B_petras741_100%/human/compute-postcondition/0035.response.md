Output State: **`eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is `rho + q[eta[j]]`, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.**

In natural language, the value of `rho` has been updated to `rho + q[eta[j]]`. The values of `eta_ln`, the condition that `eta_ln` is greater than 1, and the expression for `res` remain unchanged.
