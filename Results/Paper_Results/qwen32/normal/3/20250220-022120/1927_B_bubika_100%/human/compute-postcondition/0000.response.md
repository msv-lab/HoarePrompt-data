The code snippet provided assigns a string of the alphabet to the variable `a`. This means that the previous definition of `a` as a list of integers is overwritten by this string assignment. The other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.
