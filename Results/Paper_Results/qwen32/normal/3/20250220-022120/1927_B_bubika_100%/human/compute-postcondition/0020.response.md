The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is less than the input integer `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Since `t` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one more than its current value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer represents the count of the corresponding index in `s`; `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces; `r` is a string formed by concatenating the characters from `a` corresponding to the integers in `s`.**
