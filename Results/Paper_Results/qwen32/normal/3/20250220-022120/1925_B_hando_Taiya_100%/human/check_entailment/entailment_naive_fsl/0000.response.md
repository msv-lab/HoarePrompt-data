Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset by iterating through the divisors of `x` and checking if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems with the given constraints. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Iterate through divisors**: The program iterates through all possible divisors of `x` up to the integer square root of `x`. This is efficient because if `d` is a divisor of `x`, then `x/d` is also a divisor, and one of them will be less than or equal to the square root of `x`.

2. **Check divisibility and feasibility**:
   - For each divisor `i`, the program checks if `n <= x // i`. If true, it means `i` can be used as a difficulty for one of the sub-problems, and the remaining difficulties can be distributed among the other sub-problems.
   - Similarly, the program checks if `n <= i`. If true, it means `x // i` can be used as a difficulty for one of the sub-problems, and the remaining difficulties can be distributed among the other sub-problems.

3. **Update the maximum balance**: The program keeps track of the maximum balance found during the iteration.

4. **Output the result**: For each test case, the program prints the maximum balance.

Let's verify the logic using the provided examples:

- **First test case (10 3)**: The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10. The program checks:
  - `i = 1`: `n <= 10 // 1` (3 <= 10) and `n <= 1` (3 <= 1) are false, so no update.
  - `i = 2`: `n <= 10 // 2` (3 <= 5) is true, so `ans = max(ans, 2)` -> `ans = 2`.
  - `i = 5`: `n <= 10 // 5` (3 <= 2) is false, but `n <= 5` (3 <= 5) is true, so `ans = max(ans, 2)` -> `ans = 2`.
  - The program correctly outputs `2`.

- **Second test case (5 5)**: The divisors of 5 are 1, 5. The program checks:
  - `i = 1`: `n <= 5 // 1` (5 <= 5) and `n <= 1` (5 <= 1) are false, so no update.
  - `i = 5`: `n <= 5 // 5` (5 <= 1) is false, but `n <= 5` (5 <= 5) is true, so `ans = max(ans, 1)` -> `ans = 1`.
  - The program correctly outputs `1`.

- **Third test case (420 69)**: The divisors of 420 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420. The program checks:
  - `i = 6`: `n <= 420 // 6` (69 <= 70) is true, so `ans = max(ans, 6)` -> `ans = 6`.
  - The program correctly outputs `6`.

The program handles all edge cases and the logic is sound, ensuring that the maximum balance is found for every test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
