The provided code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and for each test case, `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x. The code snippet updates the values of `x` and `n` based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers read from the input where 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8.**

In this output state, `t` retains its initial value as it is not affected by the code snippet. The values of `x` and `n` are updated to the integers provided in the input, and they satisfy the conditions 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8.
