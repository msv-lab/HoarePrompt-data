The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. Since the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1`, we need to adjust the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop head.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is a divisor of `x` and has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `isqrt(x) + 1`.

Let's determine the new state:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `x` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `i` is a divisor of `x` such that `x % i == 0` and `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and both `x // i` and `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1.**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, now `i` is `k + 1`.** 

Given that `i` is incremented by 1, the new state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `i` is a divisor of `x` such that `x % i == 0` and `i` is incremented by 1. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and both `x // i` and `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `i` is now `i + 1`.**

Simplified for clarity:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` is an integer where 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `i` is incremented by 1.**
