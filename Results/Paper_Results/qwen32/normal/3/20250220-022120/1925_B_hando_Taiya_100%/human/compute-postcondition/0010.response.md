Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `x` and `n` are integers where 1 <= n <= x <= 10^8; `i` is a divisor of `x` such that `x % i == 0`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. If `n` is greater than `i`, `ans` remains unchanged.**
