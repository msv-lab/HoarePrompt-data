Postcondition: **`ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, otherwise it is the initial value of `ans` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` was 2, plus the sum of all elements in `tmp`, plus the third element of `a` (new value of `y`), plus `x + y - 2`. `y` is the third element of the sorted list `a`. `ii` is the initial value of `ii` plus `len(a) - 1`. `tt` remains the same. `n` and `x` remain the values read from the input. `a` remains the sorted list of integers read from the input. `tmp` is a list that must have at least one element. Additionally, `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.**
