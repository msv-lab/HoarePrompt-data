Postcondition: **`ans` is `x + y - 1 + 1` if the difference between the 3rd element and the 2nd element of `a` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `x + y - 2 + 1` if the difference is even and not equal to 2, and `ans` is `x + y - 2` if the difference is odd; `ii` is incremented by 1; `tt` remains the same; `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values provided by the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input with at least 2 elements; `i` is 3; `tmp` contains one additional element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if the difference between the 3rd element and the 2nd element of `a` is even and not equal to 2.**
