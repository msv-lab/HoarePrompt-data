Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one more element, and `i` is the next element in `tmp` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
