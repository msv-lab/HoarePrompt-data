Postcondition: **`ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the count of differences of 2 in `a`, `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their input values, `a` remains unchanged, `tmp` contains `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for even differences not equal to 2, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2, and `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0`**
