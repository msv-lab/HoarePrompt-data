The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `ans`, `ii`, `tt`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the count of differences of 2 in `a`; `ii` is `len(a) - 1`; `tt` remains the same; `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their input values; `a` remains unchanged; `tmp` is a list containing at least one element, for example, `[1]`; `y` is less than `i - 1`.**
