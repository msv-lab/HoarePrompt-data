Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2. If the current difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, `tmp` includes an additional element, which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.**
