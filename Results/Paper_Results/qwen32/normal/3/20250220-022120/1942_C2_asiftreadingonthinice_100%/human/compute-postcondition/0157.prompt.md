Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the count of differences of 2 in `a`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their input values, `a` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is sorted containing `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for even differences not equal to 2. Additionally, if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2 but is even, `tmp` also contains `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the count of differences of 2 in `a`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is further increased by `i` and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `a` retain their input values, and `tmp` is a list containing at least one element, for example, `[1]`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, `y` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the count of differences of 2 in `a`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is further increased by `i` and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged. `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `a` retain their input values, and `tmp` is a list containing at least one element, for example, `[1]`. `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the count of differences of 2 in `a`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is further increased by `i` and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged. `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `tt` remains the same, `n`, `x`, and `a` retain their input values, and `tmp` is a list containing at least one element, for example, `[1]`. `i` is 1. If `y` was initially greater than or equal to `i - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is not broken. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
