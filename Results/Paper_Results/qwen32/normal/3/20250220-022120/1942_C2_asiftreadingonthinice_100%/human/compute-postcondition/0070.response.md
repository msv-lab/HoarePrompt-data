Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 4, `tmp` contains the value `(a[4] - a[3]) // 2` appended to it.**

In simple terms, the list `a` remains unchanged and still contains at least 2 elements in sorted order. The variable `i` remains 4. The list `tmp` has a new element added to it, which is the integer division of the difference between the 5th element (`a[4]`) and the 4th element (`a[3]`) of the list `a`.
