Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `tt` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `tmp` is a sorted list containing at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, and `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `i`. `y` is the previous value of `y` minus `i` plus 1.**

In natural language: The value of `y` is updated to be the previous value of `y` minus `i` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
