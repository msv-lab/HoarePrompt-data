The task involves analyzing a Python code snippet with a given initial state. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `i`. However, the `print` statement in the code is `print(1, 1)`, which directly prints the integers 1 and 1, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `i`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
   - `n` is the integer value provided by the user input.
   - `i` is initialized to 0.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print(1, 1)` statement is executed. This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `i`. It simply prints the integers 1 and 1, separated by a space.

3. **Output**:
   - Since the print statement is hardcoded to print `1, 1`, the output will be exactly that.

Output: **1 1**
