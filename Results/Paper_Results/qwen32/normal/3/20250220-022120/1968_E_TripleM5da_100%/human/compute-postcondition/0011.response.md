In the given task, the for loop is defined as `for i in range(0, int(input())):`. This means that the loop will iterate from 0 up to, but not including, the integer value provided by the user input. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3
- `i` is an integer such that i = n + 1

However, the loop variable `i` is controlled by the loop itself and is not influenced by the value of `n` outside the loop. The loop will start with `i` set to 0, regardless of the value of `n`.

Since the loop condition is determined by the user input and not by the value of `n` or `t`, the state of `t` and `n` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The only state that needs to be considered is `i`, which should be set to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 0**
