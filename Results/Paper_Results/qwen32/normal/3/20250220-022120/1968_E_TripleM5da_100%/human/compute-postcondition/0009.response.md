Given the initial state, we have the following information:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` is an integer such that 5 <= i <= n + 1.

The `print(i, i)` statement will output the value of `i` twice. Since the exact value of `i` is not specified beyond the range 5 <= i <= n + 1, we cannot determine a single specific value for `i`. However, we know that whatever the value of `i` is, it will be printed twice.

Output: **i, i (where i is an integer such that 5 <= i <= n + 1)**
