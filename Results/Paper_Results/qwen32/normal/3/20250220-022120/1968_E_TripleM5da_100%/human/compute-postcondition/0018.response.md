Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `i` is 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly stated to be 3.
- The `print` statement is printing the value of `i` twice.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is 3, the `print` statement will output the value 3 twice.

### Output:
Output: **3 3**
