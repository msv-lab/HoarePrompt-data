Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for a given \(n \times n\) grid by selecting \(n\) cells. However, the program does not correctly implement the logic to achieve this goal for all values of \(n\).

Let's break down the program and its logic:
- The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- For each test case, it reads the integer \(n\).
- It then prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2).
- For \(i\) from 3 to \(n\), it prints the coordinates (i, i).

The output for \(n = 2\) is correct, producing points (1, 1) and (1, 2), which gives the set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\).

However, for \(n \geq 3\), the program does not generate the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances. For example:
- For \(n = 3\), the program outputs (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will be \(\{0, 1, 4\}\), which is not optimal. The optimal set \(\mathcal{H}\) can be \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) with points (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1).
- For \(n = 4\), the program outputs (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4). The set \(\mathcal{H}\) will be \(\{0, 1, 4, 6\}\), which is not optimal. The optimal set \(\mathcal{H}\) can be larger with a different arrangement of points.

The program fails to provide the correct output for \(n \geq 3\) as it does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
