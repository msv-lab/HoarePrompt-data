The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition `range(3, n + 1)`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer such that 4 <= i <= n + 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is an integer such that 5 <= i <= n + 1**
