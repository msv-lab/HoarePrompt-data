The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `i`. Specifically, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` must be at least 3, and `i` is explicitly set to 3.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Given that `i` is explicitly set to 3, the `print` statement will output the value of `i` twice. Therefore, the output will be the number 3 followed by the number 3, separated by a space.

Output: **3 3**
