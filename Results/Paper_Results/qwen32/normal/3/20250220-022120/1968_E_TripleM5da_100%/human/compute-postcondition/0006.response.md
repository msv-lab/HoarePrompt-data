The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value between 3 and `n`, and `n` is between 3 and 1000. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that the loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. If `i` is currently `n`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` from the previous iteration, and `n` should remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is an integer such that 4 <= i <= n + 1**
