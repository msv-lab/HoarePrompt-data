Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The condition for this to be possible is that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even and non-negative.

### Program Code:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes", otherwise "No".

### Function Summary Recap:
The function reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case and checks if the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative. If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Original Assessment Recap:
The original assessment claims the program is incorrect because the condition `n - m >= 0` is not sufficient. However, the condition `n - m >= 0` is indeed necessary because you cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Parity Condition**: `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the parity of the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even. This is necessary because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, so the parity of the difference must match.
2. **Non-negativity Condition**: `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of cubes `m` is not greater than the number of moves `n`. This is necessary because you cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves.

Given these conditions:
- If `n - m` is even and non-negative, it is indeed possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- If `n - m` is odd, it is impossible to achieve exactly `m` cubes because the parity would not match.
- If `n - m` is negative, it is impossible to achieve exactly `m` cubes because you cannot have more cubes than the number of moves.

### Counterexample Analysis:
The counterexample provided in the original assessment (`1 0`) is actually correctly handled by the program:
- For `n = 1` and `m = 0`, the condition `(1 - 0) % 2 == 0` is true, but `1 - 0 >= 0` is also true.
- However, the correct interpretation is that it is impossible to have 0 cubes after 1 move because the only possible move is to add a cube, not remove one (since the tower starts with 0 cubes).

The original assessment's counterexample is misleading because it assumes that the program should handle the case where `m` is greater than `n` incorrectly, but the problem constraints ensure that `m` cannot be greater than `n` due to the non-negativity condition.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect because the provided program correctly implements the necessary conditions to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Final: **True**
