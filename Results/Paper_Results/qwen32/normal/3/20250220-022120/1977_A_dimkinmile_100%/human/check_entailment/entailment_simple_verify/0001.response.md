Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies the key conditions for the problem and accurately describes the logic implemented in the program. The program checks if the difference between the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` is even and non-negative, which is the correct approach based on the problem description. The annotated code supports this reasoning by showing the state of the program at key points and confirming that the logic is applied correctly for each test case. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
