Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but reads input for multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of moves and `m` represents the desired number of cubes in the tower. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
