### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining whether, after `n` moves, Nikita can have exactly `m` cubes in the tower. Each move can either add or remove one cube. Therefore, the difference between the number of moves (`n`) and the number of cubes (`m`) must be even. This is because every pair of moves (one addition and one removal) will result in no net change or a change of Â±2 cubes. If `n - m` is even, it means that the excess moves (after forming `m` cubes) can be balanced out by adding and removing cubes in pairs.

Additionally, `n - m` must be non-negative because you cannot have more cubes than moves (since you can only add one cube per move and start with zero cubes).

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `n - m` is even and non-negative.
- If the condition is satisfied, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

This matches the problem's requirements exactly.

### Correctness: **True**
