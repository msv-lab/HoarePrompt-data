Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. We need to determine if, after `n` moves, it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower.

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial State:** The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Possible Moves:** Each move can either increase or decrease the number of cubes by 1.
3. **Parity Consideration:** If `n` is the total number of moves and `m` is the final number of cubes, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and an even number of such changes is required to reach an exact number `m` from 0.
4. **Non-Negative Moves:** Since Nikita cannot have a negative number of cubes, `n - m` must be non-negative (i.e., `n >= m`).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows the correct logic to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
- If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Example Walkthrough:
- **Test Case 1:** `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `n - m = 0` (even and non-negative), so the output is "Yes".
- **Test Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `n - m = -2` (negative), so the output is "No".
- **Test Case 3:** `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `n - m = 2` (even and non-negative), so the output is "Yes".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly checks the necessary conditions for the problem and outputs the correct result for each test case.
Correctness: **True**
