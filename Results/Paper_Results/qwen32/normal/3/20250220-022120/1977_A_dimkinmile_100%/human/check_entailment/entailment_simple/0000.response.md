### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube.

The key observation is that for every pair of moves (one addition and one removal), the net effect is zero cubes. Therefore, if the difference between the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` is even, it means that the excess or deficit cubes can be balanced out by pairs of addition and removal moves. Additionally, `n` must be at least `m` because you can't remove more cubes than you have, so `n - m` should be non-negative.

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this logic. It checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` (i.e., the difference is even) and `n - m >= 0` (i.e., the difference is non-negative). If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes", indicating that it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. Otherwise, it prints "No".

The annotated program and the function `func_1` correctly handle the logic described above.
