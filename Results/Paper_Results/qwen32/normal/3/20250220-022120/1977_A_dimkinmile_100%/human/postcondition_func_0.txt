The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `m`. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes in the tower using `n` moves, under the condition that the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative. It prints "Yes" if the condition is met, otherwise "No".
