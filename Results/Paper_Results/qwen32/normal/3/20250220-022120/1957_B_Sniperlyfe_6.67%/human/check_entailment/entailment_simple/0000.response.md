### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the logic behind it. The goal is to create a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all the integers in the sequence.

The provided function `func_1` attempts to achieve this by:
1. Initializing a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
2. Setting each element of `nums` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` until `k` is exhausted or all elements are set.
3. Adjusting the last element of `nums` to account for any remaining `k` after the loop.

Let's consider the following points:
- `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`. For example, if `k` is 10 (binary `1010`), then `k.bit_length()` is 4, and `(1 << 4 - 1) - 1` is 7 (binary `0111`).
- The function sets each element of `nums` to this value, which is not necessarily optimal for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
- After setting `n-1` elements, the remaining value of `k` is added to the last element of `nums`.

This approach does not guarantee that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized. Instead, a better strategy would be to distribute the value of `k` in a way that maximizes the number of bits set to 1. One such strategy would be to use the smallest powers of 2 that sum up to `k`, as this would maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

### Example:
For `n = 2` and `k = 5`, the given program would set both elements to `(1 << 3 - 1) - 1 = 3` (binary `0011`), resulting in a bitwise OR of `0011 | 0011 = 0011` (binary), which has 2 ones. However, the optimal solution is `1 4` (binary `0001 | 0100 = 0101`), which has 2 ones, but a different distribution that can be more optimal in other cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
