The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is the loop variable that gets initialized within the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

The provided state includes `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums`. Among these, only `n` is relevant for the loop to execute. The values of `t`, `k`, and the contents of `nums` do not affect whether the loop will execute.

Since the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, and given that the problem statement specifies `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, the loop will definitely execute with the provided constraints on `n`.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of `n` zeros**
