The code snippet `nums[-1] += k` modifies the last element of the list `nums` by adding `k` to it. Given the initial state, `nums` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. After executing the code, the last element of `nums` will be `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the last element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.**
