The provided code snippet is just `input()`, which reads a line of input from the user. Given the initial state, this line of code will consume the first line of input, which is the integer `t` representing the number of test cases.

Output State: **The input consists of integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a single character representing the trump suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and a string of 2n two-character strings representing the cards in the discard pile. Each card is uniquely identified by its rank ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9') and suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S'). The first line of input, which is the integer `t`, has been read.**
