The code snippet appends the `rank` to the list `trumps`. The values of `t`, `n`, `trump`, `rank`, `suit`, and `card` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 16), `trump` is a single character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `rank` is the first character of `next_card`, `suit` is the second character of `next_card`, `card` is `next_card`, `trumps` includes `rank`.**
