The only variable in the loop head is `trumps`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `trumps`. If `trumps` is not an empty list (`trumps != []`), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `trumps` must contain at least one element, which means the loop can indeed execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted because the condition solely depends on `trumps`.

State: **`trumps` must contain at least one element, `answers` contains all formed pairs, `suits` contains `None` for all suits that had non-None ranks**
