The only variable in the loop head is `answer`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `answers` list. If `answers` contains at least one more pair, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `answers` must contain at least two pairs, and we have just finished processing one of those pairs. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `answers` must still contain at least one more pair.

State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `answers` must contain at least one pair, `suits` contains `None` for all suits that had non-None ranks**
