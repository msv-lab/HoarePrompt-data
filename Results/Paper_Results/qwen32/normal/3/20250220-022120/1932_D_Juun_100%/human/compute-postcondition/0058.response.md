The code sorts the `trumps` list in descending order. The `answers` and `suits` lists remain unchanged. The specific values in `trumps` are not provided, so we will denote the sorted state as `trumps` being sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`trumps` is sorted in descending order, `answers` contains all formed pairs, `suits` contains `None` for all suits that had non-None ranks.**
