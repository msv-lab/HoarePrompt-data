Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 16), `trump` is a single character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `card` is `next_card_next`, `rank` is the first element of `next_card_next`, `suit` is the second element of `next_card_next`. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` contains a new string which is the space-separated concatenation of the sorted `rank` and `suits[suit]` with `suit` appended to each, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. Otherwise, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.**
