Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v2`; `n` must be at least 5; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(n - 3)`, `ops` now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`**

In this output state, the set `vx` remains unchanged, still containing integers from 1 to `n` except for `v1` and `v2`. The value of `n` is still at least 5, and the values of `v1` and `v2` are still the values returned by the function `q(n - 3)`. The only change is that the list `ops` now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`.
