To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how the variables `p1` and `p2` are modified based on the contents of `ops`.

### Loop Analysis:
1. The loop iterates over `ops` in reverse order.
2. For each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops`:
   - If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`.
   - Otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`.

### Given Information:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers.
  - `p1` is a list containing the same 2 integers as `vx`.
  - `p2` is an empty list.
  - `ops` is a list containing tuples that document the operations performed during the loop.

- **Output State after 1 iteration**:
  - `p1` contains the integers 1, 2, and 3.
  - `p2` remains empty.
  - `ops` contains at least one tuple.

- **Output State after 2 iterations**:
  - `p1` contains the integers 1, 2, 3, and `v1`.
  - `p2` remains empty.
  - `ops` contains at least two tuples.

- **Output State after 3 iterations**:
  - `p1` is `[1, 2, 3, v1, v1]` if `v1 != v2`, otherwise `p1` is `[1, 2, 3, v1]`.
  - `p2` is `[v1]` if `v1 == v2`, otherwise `p2` is an empty list.
  - `ops` contains at least two tuples.

### Final Output State:
To understand the final output state, we need to consider the complete set of operations in `ops`. Since `ops` is iterated in reverse, the last operation in `ops` will be executed first, the second last will be executed second, and so on.

Given the pattern observed in the first three iterations, we can infer that each tuple in `ops` will either add an element to `p1` or transfer an element from `p1` to `p2` based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`.

Let's assume `ops` contains `n` tuples. After all `n` iterations:
- `p1` will contain the initial elements plus all `v1` values from the tuples in `ops`, with duplicates added if `v1 != v2`.
- `p2` will contain any `v1` values that were transferred from `p1` because `p1[-1] == v2`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state is dependent on the exact contents of `ops`. However, based on the pattern observed:
- `vx` remains unchanged as a set containing exactly 2 integers.
- `p1` contains the initial elements plus all `v1` values from `ops`, with duplicates if `v1 != v2`.
- `p2` contains any `v1` values that were transferred from `p1` because `p1[-1] == v2`.

Since the exact contents of `ops` are not provided, we can only generalize the final state as described above.

Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers; `p1` is a list containing the initial integers plus all `v1` values from `ops`, with duplicates if `v1 != v2`; `p2` contains any `v1` values that were transferred from `p1` because `p1[-1] == v2`; `ops` is a list containing the original tuples.**
