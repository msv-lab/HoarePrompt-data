The only objects in the loop head are the variables `v1` and `v2`, which are obtained from the tuples in the `ops` list in reverse order. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether there are more tuples in `ops` to process.

At the end of the last iteration, `ops` contains at least one tuple with two elements. Since the loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`, the last iteration would have processed the first tuple in the reversed `ops` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more tuple in the original `ops` list that hasn't been processed yet.

Let's denote the next tuple in `ops` (when iterating in reverse) as `(v1_next, v2_next)`. This means that at the start of the next iteration, `v1` will be `v1_next` and `v2` will be `v2_next`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

State: **`vx` contains 1 or 2 elements; `ops` contains at least two tuples with two elements; if `p1[-1] == v2` then `p1` contains the same elements as `vx` and `p2` contains `v1`, otherwise `p1` contains the same elements as `vx` with `v1` appended and `p2` is an empty list; `v1` is the first element of the next tuple in `ops` when iterating in reverse, `v2` is the second element of the next tuple in `ops` when iterating in reverse**.
