Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive) except `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` (if `v3` was originally in the set); if `v2 <= 0`, `v1` and `v3` must be distinct; `v1`, `v2` are the values returned by `q(t - 3)`; `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`; `ops` is updated to include the tuple `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`**.

Natural language: The set `vx` remains unchanged, still containing integers from 1 to `t` except `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` (if `v3` was originally in the set). The conditions on `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are still valid. The list `ops` is updated to include the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
