In the provided code snippet, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the number of iterations is determined by the integer value obtained from `int(input())`. This integer value represents the number of test cases, `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that the input to `int(input())` is a positive integer, specifically within the range 1 to 1000 as per the problem statement. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted explicitly since it is assigned by the loop itself.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **The input for `int(input())` must be a single integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**

This ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, once for each test case.
