To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head: `(v1, v2)` and `ops`.

The loop iterates over the reversed list `ops[::-1]`. For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one tuple. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`ops`**: This list must contain at least one tuple `(v1, v2)` for the loop to execute. If `ops` is empty, the loop will not execute.

2. **`(v1, v2)`**: These variables are assigned values from the tuples in `ops` during each iteration. Since the loop iterates over the reversed `ops`, the first iteration will use the last tuple in the original `ops` list.

Given the state before the loop starts, `ops` is an empty list. To ensure the loop executes, we need to modify `ops` to contain at least one tuple. The values of `v1` and `v2` do not need to be specified in advance because they will be assigned from the tuples in `ops` during the loop execution.

Therefore, the adjusted state must ensure that `ops` contains at least one tuple. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers; `p1` is a list containing the same 2 integers as `vx`; `p2` is an empty list; `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple**.
