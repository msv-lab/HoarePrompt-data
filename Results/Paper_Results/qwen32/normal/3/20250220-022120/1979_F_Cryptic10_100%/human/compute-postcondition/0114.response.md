To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the components and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Breakdown of the Code and Variables:
1. **`p1`**: This list contains elements from `ops` where the last element of `p1` (`p1[-1]`) is not equal to `v2` at the time of processing.
2. **`p2`**: This list contains elements from `ops` where the last element of `p1` (`p1[-1]`) is equal to `v2` at the time of processing.
3. **`p1[::-1]`**: This reverses the list `p1`.
4. **`p1[::-1] + p2`**: This concatenates the reversed `p1` with `p2`.
5. **`' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2))`**: This converts each element in the concatenated list to a string and joins them with a space.

### Explanation of the Output:
- The `print` statement constructs a string by joining the elements of the reversed `p1` and `p2` lists with spaces.
- The string is prefixed with `! `.
- The final output will be in the form `! [reversed p1 elements] [p2 elements]`.

Since the exact elements of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these lists.

### Final Output:
Output: **! [reversed elements of p1] [elements of p2] (where p1 contains elements from ops where p1[-1] != v2, and p2 contains elements from ops where p1[-1] == v2)**
