Output State: **`vx` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` is not greater than 0), `v1` is the value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before removal, `v2` is the value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` before removal, `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`, and `n` must be at least 5.**

Explanation: The set `vx` has `v3` removed from it. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `n` remain unchanged. The condition regarding `v2` being greater than 0 or not remains the same.
