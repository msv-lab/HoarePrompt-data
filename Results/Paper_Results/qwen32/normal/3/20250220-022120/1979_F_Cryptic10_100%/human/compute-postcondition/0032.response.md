Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

Initial State:
- `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers.
- `p1` is a list containing the same 2 integers as `vx`.
- `p2` is an empty list.
- `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple.

Code snippet:
```python
(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
```

The code snippet checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. If it is, it appends `v1` to `p2`; otherwise, it appends `v1` to `p1`.

Since `v1` and `v2` are not defined in the initial state, let's assume `v1` and `v2` are specific integers. For the sake of this example, let's assume `v1` is 3 and `v2` is 4 (these are just example values, and the final output state will reflect these specific values).

Let's proceed with the example values:
- Assume `vx` is `{1, 2}`.
- Assume `p1` is `[1, 2]`.
- Assume `p2` is `[]`.
- Assume `v1` is `3`.
- Assume `v2` is `4`.

Now, let's execute the code snippet:
- Since `p1[-1]` is `2` and `v2` is `4`, the condition `p1[-1] == v2` is `False`.
- Therefore, `v1` (which is `3`) is appended to `p1`.

So, `p1` becomes `[1, 2, 3]` and `p2` remains `[]`.

Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 integers; `p1` is a list containing the integers 1, 2, and 3; `p2` is an empty list; `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple.**

In natural language: The set `vx` remains unchanged. The list `p1` now contains the integers 1, 2, and 3. The list `p2` remains empty. The list `ops` is still a list containing at least one tuple.
