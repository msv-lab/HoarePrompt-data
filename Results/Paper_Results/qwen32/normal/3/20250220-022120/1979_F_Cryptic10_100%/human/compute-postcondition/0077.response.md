In this example, the loop head only contains the loop variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of `p1` or `p2`. The loop runs for a fixed number of iterations determined by the input, and the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body. Therefore, there are no states in the loop head that need to be adjusted.

The states of `p1` and `p2` are determined by the operations inside the loop body, which are not provided. However, since the question specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and the loop head does not contain `p1` or `p2`, we do not need to make any changes to `p1` or `p2`.

State: **`p1` will contain the original elements of `vx` plus all `v1` values from `ops` where the condition `p1[-1] != v2` was true, `p2` will contain all `v1` values from `ops` where the condition `p1[-1] == v2` was true.**
