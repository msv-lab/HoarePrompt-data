Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing 1 or 2 elements, `ops` is a list of tuples that records all the removals and associated operations, `p1` is a list containing the same elements as `vx`, `p2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: If `p1[-1] == v2` is `True`, then `p2` is the original `p2` with `v1` appended. If `p1[-1] == v2` is `False`, then `p1` is the original `p1` with `v1` appended.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ops` is modified such that if the last element of the first pair (`p1[-1]`) is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to the second pair (`p2`). Otherwise, `v1` is appended to the first pair (`p1`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ops` is a list of tuples, and one of the tuples in `ops` has been modified by appending `v1` to it based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. If the condition is true, `p2` is modified; otherwise, `p1` is modified.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
