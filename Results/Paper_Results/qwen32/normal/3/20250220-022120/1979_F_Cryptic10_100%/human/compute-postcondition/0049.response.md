The code snippet provided appends a tuple `(v3, 0)` and another tuple `(v1, 0)` to the list `ops`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are already defined based on the function `q` and the set `vx`. The set `vx` initially contains integers from 1 to `n` except for `v1` and `v3`. The value of `v2` is less than or equal to 0, and `v3` has been removed from `vx`.

After executing the code snippet, the set `vx` remains unchanged except for the removal of `v3`, which has already been accounted for in the initial state. The list `ops` is updated to include the two new tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` remain the same.

Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v1` and `v3`; `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values returned by `q(n - 4)` where `v2` is less than or equal to 0; `v3` is assigned the first value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`; `ops` includes the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.**
