The code `vx.remove(v1)` removes the value `v1` from the set `vx`. Given the initial state, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive). After the removal, `vx` will no longer contain `v1`. The values of `t`, `ops`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive) except `v1`; `ops` is an empty list; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(t - 2)`**.
