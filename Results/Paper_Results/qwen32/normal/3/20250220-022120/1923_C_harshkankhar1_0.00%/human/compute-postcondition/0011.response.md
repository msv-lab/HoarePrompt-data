The given code snippet updates the value of `b[i]` based on the value of `b[i - 1]` and `x`. Here, `x` is already defined as `1` if `a[i] > 1` else `2`. The variable `i` is initially `n - 1`.

Given the initial state, the value of `b[i]` will be updated to `b[i - 1] + x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, and `b` (except `b[i]`), and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `x` also remains unchanged as it is used to compute `b[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1]` to `a[n]` are the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x` for each `i` from 1 to `n` and `x` is 1 if `a[n + 1] > 1` else 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `x` is 1 if `a[n - 1] > 1` else 2, and `b[i]` is updated to `b[i - 1] + x`.**
