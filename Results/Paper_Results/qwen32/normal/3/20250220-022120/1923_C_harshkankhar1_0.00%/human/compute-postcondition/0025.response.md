Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function processes each query to determine the result based on the elements in the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) and returns the result for each query.**
