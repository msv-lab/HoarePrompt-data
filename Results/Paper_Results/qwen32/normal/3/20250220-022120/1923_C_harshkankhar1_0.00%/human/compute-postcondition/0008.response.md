The given code snippet modifies the list `b` by updating `b[i]` to be `b[i - 1] + x`, where `x` is determined by the condition `a[n + 1] > 1`. Given the initial state, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers, and `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1]` to `a[n]` are integers read from the input.

Since the code snippet only modifies `b[i]` and does not provide the value of `i`, we assume that this line is part of a loop that iterates through the indices of `b` starting from 1 to `n`. Therefore, `b[i]` will be updated for each `i` in this range.

The value of `x` is determined once before the loop starts, based on the condition `a[n + 1] > 1`. If `a[n + 1]` is greater than 1, `x` is set to 1; otherwise, `x` is set to 2. This value of `x` remains constant throughout the loop.

Thus, `b[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n` will be updated to `b[i - 1] + x`.

Given the initial state, the updated `b` will be:
- `b[0]` remains unchanged as it is the initial value.
- For each `i` from 1 to `n`, `b[i]` will be `b[i - 1] + x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is at least 1, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[1]` to `a[n]` are the integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + x` for each `i` from 1 to `n` and `x` is 1 if `a[n + 1] > 1` else 2.**
