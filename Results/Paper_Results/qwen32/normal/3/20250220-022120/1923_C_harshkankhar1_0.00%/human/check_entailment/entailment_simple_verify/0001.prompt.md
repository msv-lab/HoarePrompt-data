You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
We need to determine if a given subarray `c[l_i:r_i]` of array `c` can be considered "good" according to the rules:
1. There exists an integer array `b` of the same length as the subarray such that the sum of elements in `b` is equal to the sum of elements in the subarray.
2. Each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in the subarray.
3. Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array `c`), `q` (number of queries), the array `c` itself, and then `q` queries which are pairs of indices `(l_i, r_i)`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sum array `a` where `a[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `c`.
   - It also constructs an array `b` where `b[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of a hypothetical array where each element is `1` if the corresponding element in `c` is greater than `1`, otherwise `2`.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query `(x, y)`, it checks if the sum of the subarray `c[x:y+1]` (using the prefix sum array `a`) is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`.
   - If `a[y] - a[x-1] < b[y] - b[x-1]`, it prints "NO".
   - If `x == y`, it also prints "NO" because a single-element subarray cannot satisfy the condition of having a different element in `b`.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x-1] < b[y] - b[x-1]` is incorrect. This condition checks if the sum of the subarray in `c` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b`. However, the correct condition should check if the sum of the subarray in `c` is equal to the sum of the subarray in `b` and if there is a way to construct `b` such that each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in `c` and greater than 0.
   - The condition `x == y` is correct for single-element subarrays, but the main issue lies in the incorrect comparison of sums.

2. **Construction of `b`:**
   - The construction of `b` is flawed. The array `b` should ensure that the sum of `b` is equal to the sum of `c` and that each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in `c`. The current construction does not guarantee this.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine if a subarray is "good". Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
