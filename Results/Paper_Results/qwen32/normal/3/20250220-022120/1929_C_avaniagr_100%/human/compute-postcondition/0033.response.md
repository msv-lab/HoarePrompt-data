The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the variables `s`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is a string containing three space-separated integers.
   - `k` is the first integer from `s`.
   - `x` is the second integer from `s`.
   - `a` is the third integer from `s`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print('YES')` statement is executed.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `s`, `k`, `x`, or `a`, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
