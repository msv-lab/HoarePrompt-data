In the given task, the initial state describes the string `s` containing three space-separated integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. However, the print statement in the code snippet does not use these variables. Instead, it simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The string `s` contains three space-separated integers.
2. The integers are extracted from `s` and assigned to `k`, `x`, and `a`.
3. The `print('YES')` statement is executed, which outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the print statement does not depend on the values of `k`, `x`, or `a`, the output is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
