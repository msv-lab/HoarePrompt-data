The given Python code snippet is:

```python
current_sum = gcd_val + y
```

This line of code updates the value of `current_sum` by adding `gcd_val` and `y`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `max_sum`, `best_y`) are not modified by this line.

Since `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `y` is `y - 1` from a previous state, the new `current_sum` is the sum of this `gcd_val` and the decremented `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for the last `x` processed, `x` remains `next_x` (the next element in `test_cases`), `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, no updates are made to `max_sum` or `best_y`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `current_sum` is now the sum of `gcd_val` and the decremented `y`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
