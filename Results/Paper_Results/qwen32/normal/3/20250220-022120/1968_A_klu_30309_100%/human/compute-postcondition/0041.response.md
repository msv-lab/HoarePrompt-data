The code snippet calculates `current_sum` as the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. The value of `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `y` has been decremented by 1 in the previous steps.

To determine the output state, we need to update `current_sum` based on the given values of `gcd_val` and `y`. Since the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we will express `current_sum` in terms of `gcd_val` and `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is updated to `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**
