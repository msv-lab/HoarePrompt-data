Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `best_y` is 2, `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `gcd_val` is 2, `current_sum` is 4. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_sum` remains unchanged.**
