Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`. `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, only `x` is updated to the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is updated to `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y`.**
