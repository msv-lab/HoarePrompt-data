You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing the value of `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`. Each `best_y` is the value of `y` that gave the maximum sum for the corresponding `x` processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of y from x-1 down to 1, calculating the gcd of x and y, and then checking if the sum of y and the gcd is greater than the current maximum sum found. If it is, the program updates the maximum sum and the best y value. However, there is a crucial issue with the program: it breaks out of the loop after finding the first y that maximizes the sum, which is not necessarily the correct behavior.

The correct approach should be to continue checking all possible values of y to ensure that the maximum sum is found. The `break` statement in the loop prematurely exits the loop after the first candidate y is found, which might not be the optimal solution.

Given the test cases provided, the program might by chance produce the correct output for some inputs, but it does not guarantee the correct output for all possible inputs within the problem constraints.
