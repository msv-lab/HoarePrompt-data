Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is 1, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and the relationship between `current_sum` and `max_sum` remain unchanged. The only change is that we execute a `break` statement, which will exit the most internal loop or if statement we are currently inside.
