Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `best_y` is 2, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 4. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is set to 1, `max_sum` is updated to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `best_y`, `max_sum`, and the control flow remain unchanged.**
