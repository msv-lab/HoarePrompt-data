Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
    gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
    current_sum = gcd_val + y
    if current_sum > max_sum:
        max_sum = current_sum
        best_y = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is updated to `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is a predefined integer, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is updated to `y`. `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, only `x` is updated to the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is updated to `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `x` is the next element in `test_cases`, `y` is `y + 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y` and `best_y` is updated to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `max_sum` and `best_y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
