To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change during each iteration.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over `y` from `x - 1` down to `1` for each `x` in `test_cases`. For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y`, computes `current_sum` as `gcd_val + y`, and checks if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`. If it is, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is set to `y`. The loop breaks after the first time `max_sum` is updated.

### Observations from Given Output States
1. **First Iteration**: `x = 2`, `y = 1`, `gcd_val = 1`, `current_sum = 2`. Since `current_sum` is not greater than `max_sum` (which is 0 initially), `max_sum` remains 0 and `best_y` remains 1.
2. **Second Iteration**: `x = 2`, `y = 2`, `gcd_val = 2`, `current_sum = 4`. Since `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum` (0), `max_sum` is updated to 4 and `best_y` is set to 2. The loop breaks after this iteration.
3. **Third Iteration**: This iteration is not valid because the loop breaks after the second iteration.

Given these observations, the loop will break after the first time it finds a `y` that maximizes `current_sum` for a given `x`. Since the loop breaks after the second iteration, it means that for `x = 2`, the loop only runs twice (for `y = 2` and `y = 1`).

### General Case for All `x` in `test_cases`
For each `x` in `test_cases`, the loop will iterate from `x - 1` down to `1`, and the first `y` that maximizes `current_sum` will be found, updating `max_sum` and `best_y` accordingly. The loop will break after finding this `y`.

### Final Output State
After processing all `x` in `test_cases`, the final state will be:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- `results` remains an empty list.
- `max_sum` will be the maximum `current_sum` found across all `x` in `test_cases`.
- `best_y` will be the `y` that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed.

### Conclusion
Since the problem doesn't specify the exact values of `t` and `test_cases`, we can only describe the final state in terms of the variables that are affected by the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is the maximum `current_sum` found across all `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the `y` that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed.**

In simpler terms, `max_sum` will hold the highest sum of `gcd_val + y` found for any `x` and `y` pair, and `best_y` will be the `y` that gave this highest sum for the last `x` processed.
