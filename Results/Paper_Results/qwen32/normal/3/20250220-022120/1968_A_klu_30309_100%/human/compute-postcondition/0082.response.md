Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is the maximum sum found for the last `x` processed, `best_y` is the value of `y` that gave the maximum sum for the last `x` processed, `x` is the last `x` processed, `y` is the value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for the last `x` processed, or the value where the loop broke, and `gcd_val` and `current_sum` are the values from the last iteration for the last `x` processed.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `results` will contain the `best_y` value for each `x` in `test_cases`. The variable `max_sum` will hold the maximum sum found for the last `x` processed, and `best_y` will be the `y` value that gave this maximum sum. The variable `x` will be the last element in `test_cases` that was processed, and `y` will be the value that gave the maximum `current_sum` for this last `x`, or the value where the loop broke. The variables `gcd_val` and `current_sum` will reflect the values from the last iteration for the last `x` processed. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
