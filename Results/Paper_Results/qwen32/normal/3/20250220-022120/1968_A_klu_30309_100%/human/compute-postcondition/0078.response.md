Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer `x` satisfies 2 <= `x` <= 1000, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for the last `x` processed, `x` remains `next_x` (the next element in `test_cases`), `y` is `y + 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is `current_sum`, `best_y` is equal to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `best_y` is updated to the current value of `y`. All other variables retain their previous values.
