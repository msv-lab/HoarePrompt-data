The only variable in the loop head is `k`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2. The variables `t`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `res`, `ans`, `c`, `l`, and `r` are not directly involved in determining whether the loop will execute. Therefore, we only need to adjust `n` to ensure that `n - 1` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`**
