Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer obtained from the input, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `k` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `(ans // arr[r]) % MOD`, `l` is incremented by 1 if `s[k] == 'L'` (unchanged in this case), `r` is decremented by 1 (unchanged in this case), `res` is a list of `n` integers where `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `res[1]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, and all other `res[i]` for `i` not equal to `0`, `1`, or `c` are `0`, `c` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `k`, `ans`, `l`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged except for `res[c]` and `c` which are updated as specified.
