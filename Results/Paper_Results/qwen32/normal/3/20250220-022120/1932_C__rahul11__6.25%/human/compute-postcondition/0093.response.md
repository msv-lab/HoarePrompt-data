Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is at least 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is `ans % m % MOD`, the second element is `ans % m % MOD`, the third element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the fourth element is `ans % m % MOD`, and the rest are 0; `c` is 3; `k` is 3. If `s[k]` is 'L', then `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and `r` is decreased by 1.**
