Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `res` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element updated to `ans % m % MOD`; `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` divided by `arr[l]` modulo `MOD`; `c` is 1; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; and `s[k]` is 'L'.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to the result of the expression `ans // arr[l] % MOD`. All other variables retain their initial values.
