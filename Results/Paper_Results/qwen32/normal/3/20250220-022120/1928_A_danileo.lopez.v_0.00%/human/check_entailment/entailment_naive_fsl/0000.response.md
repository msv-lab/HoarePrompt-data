Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. The key insight is that if either dimension of the original rectangle is even, Bob can always cut it into two rectangles that can be reassembled into a different rectangle. This is because an even dimension allows for the creation of two smaller rectangles with integer sides that can be recombined in a new configuration.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- If `a % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 == 0`, it means that Bob can cut the rectangle along the side with the even dimension into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. These smaller rectangles can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, then any cut will result in two rectangles with at least one odd dimension, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

The provided examples in the problem description are consistent with this logic:
- For `1 1`, both dimensions are odd, so the output is "No".
- For `2 1`, one dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
- For `2 6`, one dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
- For `3 2`, one dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
- For `2 2`, both dimensions are even, so the output is "Yes".
- For `2 4`, one dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
- For `6 3`, one dimension is even, so the output is "No".

The code handles all these cases correctly, and there are no edge cases that it fails to address given the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
