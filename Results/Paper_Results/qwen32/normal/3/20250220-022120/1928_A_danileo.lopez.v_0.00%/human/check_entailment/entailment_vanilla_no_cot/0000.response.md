Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after cutting the original rectangle. The logic is based on the observation that if either dimension of the rectangle is even, the rectangle can be cut in such a way to form a new rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, the resulting smaller rectangles will be 1x(dimension), and no new rectangle can be formed other than the original one (or its rotated version).

Here's a brief explanation of the logic:
- If `a % 2 == 0` (a is even), the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and these can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If `b % 2 == 0` (b is even), the same logic applies.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, the only possible smaller rectangles are 1x(dimension), and they can only form the original rectangle or its rotated version.

The program correctly implements this logic and should work efficiently within the given constraints.
