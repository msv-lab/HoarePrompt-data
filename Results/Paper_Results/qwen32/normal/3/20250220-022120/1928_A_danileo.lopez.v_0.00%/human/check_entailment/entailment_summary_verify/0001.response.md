### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to verify if the assessment is accurate.

The core of the problem is to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. The key insight is that for Bob to form a new rectangle, at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle must be even. Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to the shorter side, the two resulting rectangles will have dimensions of the form `(shorter_side, longer_side / 2)`. For these to be valid rectangles with integer dimensions, `longer_side` must be even.
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to the longer side, the two resulting rectangles will have dimensions of the form `(longer_side, shorter_side / 2)`. For these to be valid rectangles with integer dimensions, `shorter_side` must be even.

2. **Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always make a cut that results in two rectangles with integer dimensions, which can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, any cut will result in two rectangles with non-integer dimensions, and thus, Bob cannot form a new rectangle.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even and prints "Yes" if so, otherwise "No". This matches the reasoning described above.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
