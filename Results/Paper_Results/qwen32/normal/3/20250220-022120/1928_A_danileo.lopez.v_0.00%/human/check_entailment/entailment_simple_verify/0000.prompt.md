You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: t is 0, a and b are the last values provided as input, and the program has printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each of the t iterations based on whether at least one of a or b is even.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. The key insight is that if either dimension of the original rectangle is even, Bob can always cut it into two rectangles that can be reassembled into a different rectangle. This is because an even dimension allows for the creation of two smaller rectangles with integer sides that can be recombined in a new configuration.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- If `a % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 == 0`, it means that Bob can cut the rectangle along the side with the even dimension into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. These smaller rectangles can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, then any cut will result in two rectangles with at least one odd dimension, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

The provided examples in the problem description are consistent with this logic:
- For `1 1`, both dimensions are odd, so the output is "No".
- For `2 1`, one dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
- For `2 6`, one dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
- For `3 2`, one dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
- For `2 2`, both dimensions are even, so the output is "Yes".
- For `2 4`, one dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
- For `6 3`, one dimension is even, so the output is "No".

The code handles all these cases correctly, and there are no edge cases that it fails to address given the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
