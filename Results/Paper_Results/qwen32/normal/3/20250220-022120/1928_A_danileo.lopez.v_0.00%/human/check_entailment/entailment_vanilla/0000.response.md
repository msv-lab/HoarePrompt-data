### Reasoning:

To determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after cutting his original rectangle \(a \times b\), we need to consider the possible outcomes of the cuts.

1. **Cut Parallel to the Shorter Side:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to the shorter side, he will get two rectangles that each have one dimension equal to the shorter side and the other dimension equal to half of the longer side (if the longer side is even).

2. **Cut Parallel to the Longer Side:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle parallel to the longer side, he will get two rectangles that each have one dimension equal to the longer side and the other dimension equal to half of the shorter side (if the shorter side is even).

3. **Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - For Bob to form a new rectangle, at least one of the resulting rectangles must have integer dimensions after the cut, meaning the longer side must be divisible by 2 if the cut is parallel to the shorter side, or the shorter side must be divisible by 2 if the cut is parallel to the longer side.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, then neither cut will result in two rectangles with integer dimensions that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

Given these observations, the condition in the program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either dimension is even, Bob can form a new rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, he cannot.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described above. It checks if either dimension of the rectangle is even and prints "Yes" if so, otherwise "No".

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
