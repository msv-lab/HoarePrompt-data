To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `arr`, so we need to make sure that `arr` contains at least one element.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `count`.
- `count` is 0.
- `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.
- `arr` is the list from the next tuple in `test_cases`.

For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element. Since `arr` is derived from the next tuple in `test_cases`, the first tuple in `test_cases` must contain a non-empty list as its last element.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `arr` is a non-empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
