Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the residue map keys. Specifically, the calculation of `r_x` as `-num % x` is incorrect. The key should be based on the residue of `a_i` modulo `x` and `a_j` modulo `y` directly, rather than using `-num % x`.

Here's a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        residue_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            r_x = num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = (r_x, r_y)
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This change ensures that the residues are calculated correctly, and the program should then work as intended.
