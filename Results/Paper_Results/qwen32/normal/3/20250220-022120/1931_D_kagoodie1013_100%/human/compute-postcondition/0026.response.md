The code snippet provided resets the `residue_map` dictionary to an empty dictionary. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, and `arr`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` is the list from the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
