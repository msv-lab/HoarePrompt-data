The code snippet provided initializes a dictionary named `residue_map` without modifying any other variables. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the addition of this new dictionary.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, `1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9`, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers with each `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.**
