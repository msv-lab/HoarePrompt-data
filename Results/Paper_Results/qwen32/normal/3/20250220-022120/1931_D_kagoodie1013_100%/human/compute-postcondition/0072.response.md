Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains a tuple `(n, x, y)` and a list `a`. Here, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `x` and `y` are integers. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the count of how many times a pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been encountered before for each element in `a` for each test case.**
