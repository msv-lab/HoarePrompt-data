The code snippet provided simply initializes the variable `count` to 0. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, `test_cases`, `results`, `residue_map`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is a dictionary with keys as `(num % x, num % y)` and values as their respective frequencies, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
