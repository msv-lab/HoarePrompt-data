To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop processes each element in the array `arr` and updates the `count` and `residue_map` accordingly.

### Loop Behavior Recap:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples `(n, x, y, arr)`.
   - `results` is a list to store the final value of `count`.
   - `count` is initialized to 0.
   - `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.
   - `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are taken from the next tuple in `test_cases`.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each `num` in `arr`:
     - `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`.
     - `r_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
     - `count` is incremented by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`.
     - `current_key` is set to `(num % x, num % y)`.
     - `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the loop will have processed every element in `arr`, and `count` will reflect the total number of times a pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been encountered before for each element in `arr`.

### Output State:
- `test_cases` remains unchanged as it is only used to initialize the loop.
- `results` will contain the final value of `count`.
- `count` will be the total number of times a pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been encountered before for each element in `arr`.
- `residue_map` will contain the frequency of each `(num % x, num % y)` pair encountered in `arr`.

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop has processed all elements in `arr`, `count` will hold the total number of times a pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before for each element in `arr`. The `residue_map` will show how many times each `(num % x, num % y)` pair has appeared in `arr`. The `results` list will store this final `count` value, and `test_cases` will remain unchanged.

### Final Output State Format:
Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged, `results` contains the final value of `count`, `count` is the total number of times a pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been encountered before for each element in `arr`, `residue_map` contains the frequency of each `(num % x, num % y)` pair encountered in `arr`.**
