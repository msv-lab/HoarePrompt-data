Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the function summary to ensure everything aligns with the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to find pairs of indices \((i, j)\) in the array \(a\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, each with an array \(a\) and integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it needs to determine the number of such beautiful pairs.

#### Key Steps in `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` list to store the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - `residue_map` dictionary to keep track of the counts of certain residue pairs.

2. **Processing Each Number**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `arr`:
     - Calculate `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
     - Check if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) exists in the `residue_map`. If it does, add the count of this pair to the `count` variable.
     - Update the `residue_map` with the pair \((num % x, num % y)\), incrementing its count by 1.

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify if the program correctly identifies beautiful pairs:

- **Condition 1**: \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
  - This can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\). Thus, `r_x = -num % x` is the correct residue to check for.
  
- **Condition 2**: \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
  - This can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\). Thus, `r_y = num % y` is the correct residue to check for.
  
- **Counting Pairs**:
  - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of how many times each residue pair \((num % x, num % y)\) has been seen.
  - When processing each number `num`, it checks if the pair \((-num % x, num % y)\) exists in `residue_map` to find pairs that satisfy both conditions.
  - If such a pair exists, it increments the count by the number of times that pair has been seen.

### Issue in the Program
The key issue lies in the calculation of `r_x`. The program calculates `r_x = -num % x`, which is not the correct residue to check for the condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\).

The correct residue to check for \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) should be `r_x = (x - num % x) % x`. This ensures that we are checking for the correct residue that pairs with `num % x` to sum to a multiple of `x`.

### Corrected Calculation
- The correct calculation for `r_x` should be:
  \[
  r_x = (x - (num \% x)) \% x
  \]
- This ensures that `r_x` is the residue that, when added to `num % x`, results in a multiple of `x`.

### Conclusion
The original program incorrectly calculates `r_x`. This leads to incorrect identification of beautiful pairs. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
