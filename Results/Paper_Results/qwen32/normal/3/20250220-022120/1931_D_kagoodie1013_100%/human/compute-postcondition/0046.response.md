The code snippet `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. This means that the `results` list now includes the final value of `count` from the previous operations. The other variables, `test_cases`, `residue_map`, and `arr`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is the total number of times pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` have been encountered, `residue_map` is a dictionary with keys as `(num % x, num % y)` and values as their respective frequencies, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
