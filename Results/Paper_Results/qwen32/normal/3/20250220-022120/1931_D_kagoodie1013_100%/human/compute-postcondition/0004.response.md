The only object in the loop head is the variable `num` and the iterable `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If the list `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, `arr` is part of the first tuple in the `test_cases` list. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple with a non-empty `arr` list.

Here's the adjusted state:
State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, `1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9`, and `arr` is a non-empty list of `n` integers with each `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases`**
