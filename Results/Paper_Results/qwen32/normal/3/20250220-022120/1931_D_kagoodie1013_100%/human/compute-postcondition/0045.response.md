To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it updates the variables. The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`, updating the `count` and `residue_map` based on the residues of the elements when divided by `x` and `y`.

Here's a step-by-step summary of what happens in each iteration and the final output state:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `test_cases` contains at least one tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`.
   - `results` is a list containing the initial value of `count`, which is `0`.
   - `count` is `0`.
   - `residue_map` is an empty dictionary.
   - `arr` is the list from the tuple in `test_cases`.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each `num` in `arr`, the loop calculates `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - It then updates `count` by adding the value from `residue_map` for the key `(r_x, r_y)`. If `(r_x, r_y)` is not in `residue_map`, it adds `0`.
   - The `residue_map` is updated to increment the count for the key `(num % x, num % y)`.
   - This process continues for each element in `arr`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `count` will hold the total number of times pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` have been encountered.
   - `residue_map` will contain the frequency of each `(num % x, num % y)` pair encountered in `arr`.
   - `results` will still contain the final value of `count`.
   - `test_cases` and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Given this understanding, the final output state is:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one more tuple in the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is the total number of times pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` have been encountered, `residue_map` is a dictionary with keys as `(num % x, num % y)` and values as their respective frequencies, `arr` is the non-empty list from the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

In natural language, the final output state means that after processing all elements in `arr`, `count` will reflect the total occurrences of specific residue pairs, and `residue_map` will show how many times each pair of residues `(num % x, num % y)` appeared in `arr`. The `test_cases` and `arr` remain unchanged.
