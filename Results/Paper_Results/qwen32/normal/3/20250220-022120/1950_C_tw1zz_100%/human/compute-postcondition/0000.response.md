In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the function `input()`. Since the loop head does not directly involve `t` or any other variables from the loop body, we need to ensure that the input function provides a valid integer that matches `t`.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, we need to make sure that the input function returns this integer `t` when called the first time. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted in the state.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should ensure that the first call to `input()` returns the integer `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and the first call to `input()` returns `t`**
