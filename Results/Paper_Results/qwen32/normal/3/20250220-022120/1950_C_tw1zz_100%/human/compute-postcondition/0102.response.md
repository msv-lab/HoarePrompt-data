Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of `t`, `m` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of `t`. If `h` is '21', then `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '22', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '23', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` is an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.**

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the if-else block, detailing the changes to `h1` and `time` based on the value of `h`, while retaining the initial conditions for `t` and `m`.
