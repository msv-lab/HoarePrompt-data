To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the values of the variables based on the provided conditions.

1. **Initial State:**
    - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440.
    - `h` is the hour part of the new input, which can be a string from '00' to '23'.
    - `m` is the minute part of the new input, which can be a string from '00' to '59'.
    - `m1` is set to the value of `m`.
    - `time` and `h1` are determined based on the value of `h`.

2. **Conditions for `time` and `h1`:**
    - If `h` is '01', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '01'.
    - If `h` is one of '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is the same as `h`.
    - If `h` is one of '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is `h` converted to 12-hour format.
    - If `h` is '00', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '12'.
    - For all other values of `h` except '01' to '23', `time` is '' and `h1` is ''.

3. **Print Statement:**
    - The `print` statement is `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`.
    - This will concatenate `h1`, `':'`, `m`, `' '`, and `time` without any additional spaces between them.

**Analysis:**
- The exact values of `h` and `m` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact output.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of `h1`, `m`, and `time` based on the conditions.

**Output Description:**
- `h1` is determined based on the value of `h` as described above.
- `m` is the minute part of the input.
- `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`.

**Output:**
Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the hour in 12-hour format, m is the minute, and time is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of h)**
