Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of the new input, `m` is the minute part of the new input, `m1` is `m`, `time` is 'PM' if `h` is '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00', and '' otherwise, and `h1` is '04' if `h` is '16', '05' if `h` is '17', '06' if `h` is '18', '07' if `h` is '19', '08' if `h` is '20', '09' if `h` is '21', '10' if `h` is '22', '11' if `h` is '23', '12' if `h` is '00', and '' otherwise.**
