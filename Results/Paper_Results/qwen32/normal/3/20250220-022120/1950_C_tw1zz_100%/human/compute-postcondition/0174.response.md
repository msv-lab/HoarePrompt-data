The value of `h1` is set to the string `'12'`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is `'12'`, `m1` is `m`, `time` is ''.
