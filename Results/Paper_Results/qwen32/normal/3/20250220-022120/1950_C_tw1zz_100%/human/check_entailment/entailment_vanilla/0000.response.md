Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format by manually checking each possible hour value and assigning the corresponding 12-hour format hour and AM/PM designation. The program handles all cases correctly, converting hours 00 to 23 into their respective 12-hour format equivalents and appending "AM" or "PM" appropriately. However, the code is repetitive and can be simplified using arithmetic operations to determine the 12-hour format hour and the AM/PM designation. Despite this, the logic used in the program is correct for the given problem description and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
