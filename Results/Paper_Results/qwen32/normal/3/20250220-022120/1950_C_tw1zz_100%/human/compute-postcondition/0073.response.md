Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of `t` and `h` equals '18', `m` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `h1` is '06', `m1` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `time` is an empty string**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1440, `h` still equals '18', `m` remains the string representing the minute part of `t`, `h1` is now '06', `m1` remains the string representing the minute part of `t`, and `time` is still an empty string.
