Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of `t` and `h` is equal to '00', `m` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `h1` is '12', `m1` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `time` is an empty string**

In this output state, the only change is that the variable `h1` has been assigned the value '12'. All other variables retain their initial values.
