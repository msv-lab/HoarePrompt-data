Reasoning:
The provided program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it splits the input string into the hour (`h`) and minute (`m`) components. The program then uses a series of `if-elif` statements to map the 24-hour hour (`h`) to its corresponding 12-hour format (`h1`) and determines whether the time is AM or PM. The program handles all edge cases, including the transition from 12 AM to 1 AM and from 12 PM to 1 PM. Finally, it prints the converted time in the required format.

The provided test cases in the example are correctly handled by the program, and the output matches the expected results. There are no logical errors or incorrect mappings in the conversion process.

Correctness: **True**
