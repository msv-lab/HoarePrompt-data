Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of `t` and `h` is not equal to '01', '02', or '03'. `m` is a string representing the minute part of `t`, `m1` is a string representing the minute part of `t`. If `h` is '04', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is any other valid hour from '05' to '23' or '00', `h1` is adjusted accordingly and `time` is set to 'AM' for hours '05' to '11' and '00', and to 'PM' for hours '12' to '23'. If `h` is none of the above, `h1` is an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block has executed, considering all possible values of `h` and their corresponding outcomes for `h1` and `time`.
