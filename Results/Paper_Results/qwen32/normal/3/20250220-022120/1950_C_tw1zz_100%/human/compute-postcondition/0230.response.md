The value of `time` is updated to the string `'PM'`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of the new input, `m` is the minute part of the new input, `m1` is `m`, `time` is `'PM'`, `h1` is `'01'`.
