The code snippet assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `h`, `m`, `m1`, `h1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of the new input, `m` is the minute part of the new input, `m1` is `m`, `time` is 'PM', `h1` is '06'**.
