Postcondition: **`trumps` contains all ranks of trump cards except the last one or two, depending on whether the if condition was true or false. `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one or two new entries formatted as `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`. `suits` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs. `t` and `n` remain unchanged. `suit` is `next_suit` and `rank` is `next_rank`. If `rank` is `None`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables related to `rank` and `suit`.**
