Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a single character representing the trump suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and a space-separated list of 2n distinct cards where each card is represented by a two-character string. The first character of each card is a rank ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9') and the second character is a suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S'). The variable `trump` is assigned the value of the input character, which is the trump suit. The variable `trumps` is an empty list. The variable `answers` is an empty list. The variable `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', and 'S', all set to `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 16, `trump` is a character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `rank` is the rank of the first card, `suit` is the suit of the first card. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, `trumps` is a list containing the `rank` of the first card. Otherwise, `trumps` is an empty list. If `suit` is not equal to `trump` and `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is a list containing one string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` each concatenated with `suit`, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. If `suit` is not equal to `trump` and `suits[suit]` is `None`, `answers` is an empty list, and `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`, with all other keys in `suits` set to `None`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 16, `trump` is a character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `card` is the next card in the input sequence, `rank` is the first element of `card`, `suit` is the second element of `card`. If `suit` equals `trump`, `trumps` is updated to include `rank`, `answers` is updated based on `rank` and `suit`, and `suits[suit]` is updated based on `rank` and `suit`. If `suit` does not equal `trump`, `trumps` is updated based on `rank` and `suit`. If `suits[suit]` is not None, `answers` is updated to include a new string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, each concatenated with the `suit` character, and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. Otherwise, `suits[suit]` is updated to `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an integer between 1 and 16, `trump` is a character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), `card` is the next card in the input sequence, `rank` is the first element of the new `card`, `suit` is the second element of the new `card`. If `suit` equals `trump`, `trumps` is updated to include the new `rank`. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `answers` is updated with a new entry `' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])])` and `suits[suit]` is set to `None`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, it is updated to `rank`. `answers` is updated based on the new `rank` and `suit` in both cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
