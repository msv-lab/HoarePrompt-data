Output State: **`trumps` contains all ranks of trump cards except the last one, `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one new entry formatted as `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`, `suits` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `rank` remains `None` if it was `None` initially, `suit` and `rank` are the next key-value pair in the `suits` dictionary.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the state of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values and states.
