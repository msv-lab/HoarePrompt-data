The `while` loop condition is `trumps != []`, which means the loop will execute if the list `trumps` is not empty. Given the state right before the loop, `trumps` is described as a sorted empty list if it was empty, or a sorted list of trump cards. For the loop to execute, `trumps` must contain at least one element.

Since only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, we need to ensure that `trumps` is not empty. The state of `trumps` needs to be modified to contain at least one element.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`trumps` must contain at least one element, `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one entry for each non-`None` rank in `suits` (or fewer if `trumps` was exhausted); `suits` remains unchanged; `t` and `n` remain unchanged.**
