Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases involving cards and a trump suit. For each test case, it pairs non-trump cards and uses trump cards to pair any remaining unpaired cards. It prints the pairs of cards, and if there are insufficient trump cards to pair all remaining unpaired cards, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE". The function does not return any value explicitly and always returns `None` implicitly.**
