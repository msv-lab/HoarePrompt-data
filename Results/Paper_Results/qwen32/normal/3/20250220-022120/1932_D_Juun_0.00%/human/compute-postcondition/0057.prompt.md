Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trumps` contains all ranks of trump cards, `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards, `suits` contains `None` for suits with pairs and possibly one remaining rank, `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trumps` contains all ranks of trump cards except the last one, `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one new entry formatted as `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`, `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `rank` remains `None` if it was `None` initially.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `trumps` contains all ranks of trump cards except the last one or two, depending on whether the if condition was true or false. `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one or two new entries formatted as `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`. `suits` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs. `t` and `n` remain unchanged. If `rank` was `None` initially, `rank` and `suit` are updated to the next key-value pair in the `suits` dictionary. If `trumps` is empty, the program returns None.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `trumps` contains all ranks of trump cards except the last one or two, minus one if the if condition was true initially. `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one or two new entries formatted as `'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'`. If `trumps` was not empty, two new entries are added to `answers`; otherwise, the function returns nothing. `suits` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs. `t` and `n` remain unchanged. `suit` is `next_suit` and `rank` is `next_rank`. If `rank` is `None`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables related to `rank` and `suit`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
