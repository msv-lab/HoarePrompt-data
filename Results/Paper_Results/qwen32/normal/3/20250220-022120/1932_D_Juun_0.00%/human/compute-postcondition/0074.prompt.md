You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a single character representing the trump suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and a space-separated list of 2n distinct cards where each card is represented by a two-character string. The first character of each card is a rank ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9') and the second character is a suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S').
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: `trumps` contains all ranks of trump cards, `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards, `suits` contains `None` for suits with pairs and possibly one remaining rank, `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: `trumps` is empty if there were enough trump cards, `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one entry for each non-`None` rank in `suits` (or fewer if `trumps` was exhausted), `suits` remains unchanged, and `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
    #
    #Output State:
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one entry for each non-`None` rank in `suits` (or fewer if `trumps` was exhausted); `suits` remains unchanged; `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` contains all its entries, `suits` remains unchanged, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, `answer` is the last entry in `answers`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of the number of rounds, the trump suit, and a list of cards. However, the function does not return any value explicitly in any of the cases (it returns `None` implicitly).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program returns nothing (None).

Case_3: The program returns nothing explicitly, as the return statement is empty.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
