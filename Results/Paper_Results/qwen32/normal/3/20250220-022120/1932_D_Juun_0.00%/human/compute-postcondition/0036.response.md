The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or their values. Therefore, none of the variables will be changed by this statement. The loop will simply proceed to the next iteration.

Output State: **`trumps` contains all ranks of trump cards, `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards, `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair (e.g., `{'hearts': None}`), `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `rank` is `None`.**
