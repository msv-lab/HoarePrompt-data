The only variable in the loop head is `trumps`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `trumps`. If `trumps` is not an empty list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `trumps` must contain at least one element, so no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`trumps` must contain at least one element, `answers` contains all sorted pairs of non-trump cards plus one entry for each non-`None` rank in `suits` (or fewer if `trumps` was exhausted); `suits` remains unchanged; `t` and `n` remain unchanged.**
