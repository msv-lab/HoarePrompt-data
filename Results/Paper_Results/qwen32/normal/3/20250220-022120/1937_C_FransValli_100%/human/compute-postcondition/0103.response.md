Let's analyze the given task step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.
- `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, and `[0]` otherwise.
- `n` is `2`.
- `res` is the user's input string.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The `for` loop iterates over the range from `1` to `n-1`. Given that `n` is `2`, the loop will only run once with `i` equal to `1`.
- Since `n` is `2`, the loop will not execute again after the first iteration because there are no more values in the range `range(1, 2)` after `i` is `1`.

### Conclusion:
- Since the loop only runs once and `n` is `2`, there is no next iteration to prepare for. The loop will terminate after the first iteration.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
Given that there is no next iteration, the state does not need to be adjusted for another iteration. However, if we were to describe the state right before the loop terminates, it would be the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, and `[0]` otherwise; `n` is `2`; `res` is the user's input string.**

Since the loop will not execute again, this is the final state.
