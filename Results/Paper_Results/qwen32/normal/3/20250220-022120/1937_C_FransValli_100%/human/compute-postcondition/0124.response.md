Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `maxi` is 5
- `arr` is [3, 7, 9]
- `res` is the user's input string (not used in the print statement)
- `item` is 9

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement includes the string `'?'` followed by four variables: `mini`, `mini`, `item`, and `item`.
- However, in the initial state provided, there is no variable named `mini`. There is a variable `maxi` which is 5, but `mini` is not defined.
- Since `mini` is not defined in the given initial state, we cannot determine its value. This would typically result in a `NameError` if the code were executed.
- Given the task is to determine what will be printed based on the precondition, and since `mini` is not defined, we must assume there is an error in the provided information or the variable `mini` should be `maxi` by mistake.

### Assuming `mini` should be `maxi`:
- If we assume that `mini` should be `maxi` (a common typo or misunderstanding), then `mini` would be 5.
- The print statement would then be:
  ```python
  print('?', maxi, maxi, item, item, flush=True)
  ```
- Substituting the values:
  - `maxi` is 5
  - `item` is 9

### Final Output:
The print statement will output:
Output: **? 5 5 9 9**
