Postcondition: ***`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` is `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, and `[0]` otherwise; `n` is `2`; `res` is the user's input string.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the `if-else` block executes, based on the value of `res`. If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` becomes `[i]`. If `res` is `'='`, `arr` becomes `[0, i]`. If `res` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`, `arr` becomes `[0]`. The value of `maxi` remains the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists, and `n` remains `2`.
