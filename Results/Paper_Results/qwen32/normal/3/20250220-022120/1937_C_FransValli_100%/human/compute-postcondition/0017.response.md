The code assigns the value of `i` to `maxi`. No other variables are affected. Since `i` is `i + 1`, `maxi` will take that value. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 and `res` is an input string remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `res` is an input string; `maxi` is `i + 1`.**
