To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the variables `maxi` and `i` based on the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement includes the following components:
- The string `'?'`
- The variable `maxi` printed twice
- The variable `i` printed twice
- The `flush=True` argument, which ensures that the output is flushed immediately to the console

### Variables:
- `n`: This is mentioned to be greater than 1, but it is not directly used in the `print` statement.
- `maxi`: This variable is not defined in the given initial state, so its value is unknown. We can only describe it as `maxi`.
- `i`: This variable is also not defined in the given initial state, so its value is unknown. We can only describe it as `i`.

### Output Description:
Since the values of `maxi` and `i` are not explicitly provided, the best we can do is to describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **? maxi maxi i i (where maxi and i are variables whose values are not specified in the initial state)**
