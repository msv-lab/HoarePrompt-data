To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop behaves with each iteration based on the input `res`.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. During each iteration, it prints specific values and then reads an input `res`. If `res` is `<`, it updates `maxi` to the current value of `i`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
1. After the first iteration (`i = 1`), `maxi` becomes 1 if `res` is `<`.
2. After the second iteration (`i = 2`), `maxi` becomes 2 if `res` is `<`.
3. After the third iteration (`i = 3`), `maxi` becomes 3 if `res` is `<`.

The loop continues until `i` reaches `n-1`. The value of `maxi` will be the highest index `i` for which `res` is `<`.

Let's consider the final state:
- `arr` and `mini` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains the same as it is the loop's range limit.
- `maxi` will be the highest index `i` for which the input `res` was `<`.

If `res` is `<` for all iterations, `maxi` will be `n-1` at the end of the loop. If `res` is not `<` for some iterations, `maxi` will be the last index for which `res` was `<`.

Since we do not have specific information about the input `res` for all iterations, we can only determine the general outcome based on the possible inputs.

However, if we assume that `res` is `<` for all iterations, the final state would be:
- `maxi` is `n-1`.
- `arr` is [3, 7, 9].
- `mini` is 9.
- `n` is the same as the input integer.

Given this understanding, the final output state is:

Output State: **`maxi` is `n-1`, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], `mini` is 9, `n` is the same as the input integer.**

In natural language, after all iterations, `maxi` will be the highest index for which the input `res` was `<`, typically `n-1` if `res` is `<` for all iterations. The array `arr` and the variable `mini` will remain unchanged.
