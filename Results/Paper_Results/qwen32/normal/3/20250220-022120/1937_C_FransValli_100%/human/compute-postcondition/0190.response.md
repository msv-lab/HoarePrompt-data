Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `maxi` is set to `n-1`.
- `mini` is set to `item` if `res` equals `'>'`; otherwise, `mini` retains its initial value, which is `0` or `n-1`.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `arr` has at least two elements.
- `res` is the string input by the user.
- `item` is the next element in `arr`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will output a string starting with `'?'`, followed by the value of `mini` twice, and the value of `item` twice.
- The value of `mini` depends on the value of `res`:
  - If `res` is `'>'`, `mini` is set to `item`.
  - Otherwise, `mini` retains its initial value, which could be `0` or `n-1` (the problem does not specify the initial value of `mini` if `res` is not `'>'`, so we consider both possibilities).
- `item` is the next element in the list `arr`.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be:
- `'?'` followed by the value of `mini` twice, and the value of `item` twice.

Since we don't have the exact values of `res`, `mini`, and `item`, we can describe the output in terms of these variables:
- If `res` is `'>'`, `mini` will be `item`.
- If `res` is not `'>'`, `mini` will be either `0` or `n-1`.

So, the output will be:
- `'?'`, `mini`, `mini`, `item`, `item`
- Where `mini` is `item` if `res` is `'>'`, otherwise `mini` is `0` or `n-1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where mini is item if res is '>', otherwise mini is 0 or n-1, and item is the next element in arr)**
