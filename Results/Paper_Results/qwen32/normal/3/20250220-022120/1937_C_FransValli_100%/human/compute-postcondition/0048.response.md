Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the exact output.

### Initial State and Variables:
1. **Number of test cases**: At least 1.
2. **`n`**: Greater than 1.
3. **`maxi`**: The largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0.
4. **`arr`**: Contains at least two elements.
   - `arr[0]` is `mini`.
   - The rest of the elements in `arr` are `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`.
5. **`mini`**: The first element of `arr`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement includes the string `'?'`, followed by `mini` twice, and `item` twice.
- `mini` is explicitly defined as the first element of `arr`, so we know its value.
- `item` is not defined in the initial state provided. Since `item` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we can assume that `item` is a variable that has some value in the context where this print statement is executed.

### Output:
Given the information, we can describe the output as follows:
- `'?'` is a constant string.
- `mini` is the first element of the list `arr`.
- `item` is a variable whose value is not explicitly provided but is used in the print statement.

Since we don't have the exact value of `item`, we can't provide a numerical value for it. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables provided.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the first element of the list `arr` and [item] is the value of the variable `item`)**

To make it more precise and in the required format:

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is the first element of the list `arr` and [item] is the value of the variable `item`)**
