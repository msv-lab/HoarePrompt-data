To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **Test Cases**: There is at least one test case.
2. **n**: `n` is greater than 1.
3. **maxi**: This variable holds the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0.
4. **arr**: This list contains at least two elements. The first element is `mini`, and the rest are indices `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `res` was `'='` or the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`.
5. **mini**: This variable is initially set to the first element of `arr` (which is `item`).
6. **item**: This variable is the next element in `arr[1:]`.
7. **res**: This variable is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state but is used to determine the value of `mini` and `maxi`. Based on the context, `res` can be `'<'`, `'='`, or `'>'`.

### Key Points to Consider
- `mini` is initially set to the first element of `arr`, which is `item`.
- `item` is the next element in `arr[1:]` when the `print` statement is executed.
- The `print` statement outputs `'?'`, `mini`, `mini`, `item`, and `item`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - `mini` is set to the first element of `arr` (let's call this `arr[0]`).
   - `item` is set to the next element in `arr[1:]` (let's call this `arr[1]`).

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement outputs `'?'`, `mini`, `mini`, `item`, and `item`.
   - Since `mini` is `arr[0]` and `item` is `arr[1]`, the output will be `'?'`, `arr[0]`, `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[1]`.

### Conclusion
The `print` statement will output `'?'` followed by the first element of `arr` twice and the second element of `arr` twice.

Output: **? [arr[0]] [arr[0]] [arr[1]] [arr[1]] (where arr[0] is the first element of the arr list and arr[1] is the second element of the arr list)**
