Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Number of Test Cases**: At least 1 (though this doesn't affect the current print statement directly).
2. **`n`**: Greater than 1.
3. **`maxi`**: The largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0.
4. **`arr`**: Contains all `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`.
5. **`mini`**: The smallest value in `arr` that is greater than all other elements in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
```

### Values of `maxi` and `mini`:
- **`maxi`**: This variable holds the largest index `i` (from 1 to n-1) where the result `res` was `'<'`. If there was no such index, `maxi` is set to 0.
- **`mini`**: This variable holds the smallest value in `arr` that is greater than all other elements in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`. This means `mini` is the smallest value in `arr` that is greater than any `i` for which `res` was `'>'`.

### Output Description:
- The output will start with an exclamation mark `!`.
- The next value will be `maxi`, which is the largest `i` where `res` was `'<'` or 0 if `res` was never `'<'`.
- The final value will be `mini`, which is the smallest value in `arr` that is greater than any `i` where `res` was `'>'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **! [maxi] [mini] (where maxi is the largest i where res was '<' or 0 if res was never '<', and mini is the smallest value in arr that is greater than any i where res was '>')**
