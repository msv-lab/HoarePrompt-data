There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a secret permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, the function can interactively query up to 3n times to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation, and must then output a pair of indices i and j such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
