The only variable in the loop head is `item`, and it iterates over `arr[1:]`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `item` takes the next value from the slice of `arr` starting from the second element.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `maxi` is 5, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], and `res` is the user's input string, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

In the previous iteration, `item` would have been 7 (the second element of `arr`). For the loop to execute one more time, `item` should now be the next element in `arr[1:]`, which is 9.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`maxi` is 5, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], `res` is the user's input string, `item` is 9**
