Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` contains all values of `i` for which the response was `'='`, or the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'` if no `'='` responses were given; `mini` is `arr[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `maxi` is 5, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], `res` is '>'. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is set to `item`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `maxi` is 5, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], and `res` is the user's input string. If `res` is '>', the program does not change the values of `maxi` and `arr`. Otherwise, the program does not change the values of `maxi`, `arr`, or `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `maxi` is 5, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], `res` is the user's input string, `item` is 9. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is set to 9. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
