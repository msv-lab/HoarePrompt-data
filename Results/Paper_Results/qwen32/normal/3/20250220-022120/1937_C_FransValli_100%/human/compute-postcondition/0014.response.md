The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Given that `i` was incremented, we need to increase `i` by 1 for the next iteration. The value of `n` must remain the same for the loop condition to be evaluated correctly.

State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `res` is the user's input. If `res` equals '<', then `maxi` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `maxi` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so `i` is now `i + 1`.** 

Since we are only adjusting the loop head variables:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`.**
