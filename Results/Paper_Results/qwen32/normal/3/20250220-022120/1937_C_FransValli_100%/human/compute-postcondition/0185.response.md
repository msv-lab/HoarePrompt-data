Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **maxi**: This is set to `n-1`, where `n` is an input integer. However, `maxi` is not used in the print statement, so we don't need to determine its exact value for this task.

2. **mini**: This can be `0`, `n-1`, or `item` depending on the value of `res`. Since the print statement includes `mini` twice, we need to know its value. However, `mini`'s exact value isn't specified directly in the initial state, but it is dependent on the value of `res`.

3. **n**: This is an input integer, and `maxi` is `n-1`. Since `n` is not used directly in the print statement, we don't need its exact value here.

4. **arr**: This is a list with at least two elements. The print statement includes `item`, which is the next element in `arr[1:]`. This means `item` is the second element of the list `arr`.

5. **res**: This is an input string that determines the value of `mini`. Since `res` is not used directly in the print statement, we don't need its exact value for this task, but it affects `mini`.

6. **item**: This is the second element of the list `arr`.

Now, let's look at the print statement:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

- `'?'`: This is a literal string.
- `mini`: This value can be `0`, `n-1`, or `item` based on the value of `res`. Since `mini` is printed twice, both will have the same value.
- `item`: This is the second element of the list `arr`. Since `item` is printed twice, both will have the same value.

Given the information, the output will be:
Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where [mini] is either 0, n-1, or item based on the value of res, and [item] is the second element of the list arr)**
