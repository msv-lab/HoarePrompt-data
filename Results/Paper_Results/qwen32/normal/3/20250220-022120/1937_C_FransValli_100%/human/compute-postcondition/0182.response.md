The variable `mini` is reassigned the value of `item`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is `item`, `n` is the same as the input integer, `arr` must have at least two elements, `res` is the input string, and `res` equals `'>'`.

Output State: **`maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is `item`, `n` is the same as the input integer, `arr` must have at least two elements, `res` is the input string, and `res` equals `'>'`.**
