To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the variables are defined and updated.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Number of Test Cases**: At least 1.
2. **`n`**: Greater than 1.
3. **`maxi`**: The largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0.
4. **`arr`**: 
   - `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`.
   - `[i, i]` if `res` is `'<'` and the previous `arr` was `[i]`.
   - `[0, i, i]` if `res` is `'<'` and the previous `arr` was `[0, i]`.
   - `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`.
   - Unchanged if `res` is neither `'<'` nor `'='`.
5. **`res`**: The value of the new input string.
6. **`i`**: `maxi + 2`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- **`'?'`**: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- **`maxi`**: This is the largest value of `i` for which `res` was `'<'`. If no such `i` exists, `maxi` is 0.
- **`arr[0]`**: The first element of the list `arr`. The value of `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res` and the previous state of `arr`.
- **`maxi`**: This is repeated in the print statement, so it will be the same as the first `maxi`.
- **`i`**: This is `maxi + 2`.

### Output Description:
Given the initial state, we need to consider the possible values of `maxi` and `arr[0]`:
- If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0, and `arr` could be `[0, i]` if `res` was `'='`, or it could be unchanged (which would mean it was `[0, i]` or `[i]` from a previous iteration).
- If `res` was `'<'` at some point, `maxi` will be the largest `i` for which this was true, and `arr[0]` will be `0` if `arr` was `[0, i]` or `[0, i, i]` from the previous iteration, or `maxi` if `arr` was `[maxi]` or `[maxi, maxi]`.

Since the exact state of `arr` and `maxi` are not provided, we have to consider the general case based on the rules provided.

### Final Output:
Given the general rules and the structure of the problem, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` as a literal.
- `maxi` as the largest `i` for which `res` was `'<'` or `0` if never.
- `arr[0]` which depends on the previous `res` and `arr` values.
- `maxi` again, as it is repeated.
- `i` which is `maxi + 2`.

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] (where maxi is the largest value of i for which res was '<' or 0 if never, arr[0] is the first element of arr based on previous res and arr values, and i is maxi + 2)**
