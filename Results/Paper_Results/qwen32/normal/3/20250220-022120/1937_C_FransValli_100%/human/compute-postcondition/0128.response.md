To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop given the initial state and the outcomes of the first three iterations.

### Initial State Summary:
- `maxi` is 5.
- `arr` is [3, 7, 9].
- `mini` is `arr[0]` which is 3.

### Iteration Details:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `item` is 7.
   - `print('?', 3, 3, 7, 7, flush=True)` is executed.
   - `res` is '>'.
   - Since `res` is '>', `mini` is updated to 7.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `item` is 9.
   - `print('?', 7, 7, 9, 9, flush=True)` is executed.
   - `res` is the user's input string.
   - The behavior depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '>', `mini` is updated to 9. Otherwise, `mini` remains 7.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `item` is 9 (same as the second iteration).
   - `print('?', 9, 9, 9, 9, flush=True)` is executed.
   - `res` is the user's input string.
   - Since `item` is the same as `mini`, the value of `mini` will not change regardless of the `res` value.

### Final State Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `arr[1:]`, which means it iterates over `[7, 9]`.
- After the first iteration, `mini` is set to 7.
- For the second iteration, if `res` is '>', `mini` is updated to 9. If `res` is not '>', `mini` remains 7.
- The third iteration does not change `mini` because `item` is the same as `mini`.

### Conclusion:
- The final value of `mini` depends on the response in the second iteration. If `res` is '>', `mini` will be 9. Otherwise, `mini` will be 7.
- Since `maxi` and `arr` are not modified within the loop, they remain 5 and [3, 7, 9], respectively.

### Output State:
Given that the third iteration does not change `mini`, the final state is determined by the second iteration's response.

**If `res` in the second iteration is '>'**:
- `mini` is 9.
- `maxi` remains 5.
- `arr` remains [3, 7, 9].

**If `res` in the second iteration is not '>'**:
- `mini` is 7.
- `maxi` remains 5.
- `arr` remains [3, 7, 9].

Since the problem does not specify the exact response for the second iteration, we consider both possibilities:

- If `res` in the second iteration is '>', the final state is:
  Output State: **maxi is 5, arr is [3, 7, 9], mini is 9.**

- If `res` in the second iteration is not '>', the final state is:
  Output State: **maxi is 5, arr is [3, 7, 9], mini is 7.**

Given the provided information and the typical assumption in such problems that the loop runs to completion with the given `arr`, we consider the most likely final state based on the maximum possible `mini` value:

Output State: **maxi is 5, arr is [3, 7, 9], mini is 9.**
