The code snippet `arr = [i]` assigns a new list containing the value of `i` to the variable `arr`. The value of `i` is `n-1` as per the initial state. Therefore, `arr` becomes a list with a single element, which is `n-1`. The other variables (`maxi`, `mini`, `n`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is 9, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the user's input, `arr` is `[n-1]`**.
