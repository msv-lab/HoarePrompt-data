Let's break down the given information and determine the output step-by-step.

### Initial State:
1. `maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists.
2. `arr` is defined based on the value of `res`:
   - If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`.
   - If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]`.
   - Otherwise, `arr` is `[0]`.
3. `n` is `2`.
4. `res` is the user's input string.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
- `'?'` is a literal string and will be printed as is.
- `maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists. Since we don't have a specific value for `i` or the response, we can only describe it as per the given conditions.
- `arr[0]` will depend on the value of `res`:
  - If `res` is `'<'`, `arr` is `[i]`, so `arr[0]` is `i`.
  - If `res` is `'='`, `arr` is `[0, i]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
  - Otherwise, `arr` is `[0]`, so `arr[0]` is `0`.
- The second `maxi` is the same as the first `maxi`.
- `i` is a variable that is not explicitly defined in the initial state. It is implied that `i` is used to determine `maxi` and `arr` based on the response `res`. Without a specific value for `i`, we can only describe it as per the given conditions.

### Output Description:
Given the conditions, the output will vary based on the value of `res` and `i`. However, we can provide a general description:

- If `res` is `'<'`, the output will be: `? maxi i maxi i`
- If `res` is `'='`, the output will be: `? maxi 0 maxi i`
- Otherwise, the output will be: `? maxi 0 maxi i`

Since the exact values of `res` and `i` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of `maxi` and `i`:

Output: **? maxi arr[0] maxi i (where maxi is the highest value of i for which the response was '<', or 0 if no such i exists; arr[0] is i if res is '<', 0 otherwise; and i is the value of i used in the conditions)**
