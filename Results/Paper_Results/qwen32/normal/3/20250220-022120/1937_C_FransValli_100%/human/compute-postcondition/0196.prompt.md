Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a secret permutation p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1} of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, the function can interactively query up to 3n times to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation, and must then output a pair of indices i and j such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    maxi = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            maxi = i
    arr = [0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            arr = [i]
        elif res == '=':
            arr.append(i)
    mini = arr[0]
    for item in arr[1:]:
        print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '>':
            mini = item
    print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The number of test cases (int(input())) is at least 1; `n` is greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` contains all `i` values (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'='` and the most recent `i` for which `res` was `'<'`; `mini` is the smallest value in `arr` that is greater than all other elements in `arr` for which the response was `'>'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: maxi is 5, arr is [3, 7, 9], mini is 9.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: maxi is `n-1`, `mini` is the maximum value of `item` for which the response is `'>'` during the iterations, `n` is the same as the input integer, and `arr` retains its initial value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
