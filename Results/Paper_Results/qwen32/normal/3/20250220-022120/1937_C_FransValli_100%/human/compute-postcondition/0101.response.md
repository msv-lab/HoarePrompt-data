Postcondition: **`maxi` is the highest value of `i` for which the response was `'<'`, or `0` if no such `i` exists; `arr` is either `[i, i]`, `[0, i, i]`, or `[0, i]` depending on the initial state of `arr` if `res` is `'='`, otherwise `arr` remains `[i]` if `res` is `'<'`, `[0, i]` if `res` is `'='`, and `[0]` otherwise; `n` is `2`; `res` is the user's input string.**
