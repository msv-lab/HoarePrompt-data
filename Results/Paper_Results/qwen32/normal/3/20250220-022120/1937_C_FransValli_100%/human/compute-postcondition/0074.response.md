The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify the exact value of `i`, we can only infer that `i` has been incremented from its previous value. The value of `n` remains the same, and it must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

The value of `res` and `maxi` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted here. They are influenced by the loop body, which is omitted in this case.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `res` is the value of the user's input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**
