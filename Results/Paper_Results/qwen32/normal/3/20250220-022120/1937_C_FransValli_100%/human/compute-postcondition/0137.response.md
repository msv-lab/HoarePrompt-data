The provided code snippet is `maxi = i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Given the context, it seems like there might be an assumption or a missing part of the code. For the purpose of this task, let's assume that `i` is a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the code and holds a specific value. Since `i` is not provided, let's consider a hypothetical value for `i` to illustrate the transformation.

Let's assume `i` is 7 for the sake of this example.

Given this assumption, the code `maxi = i` will set `maxi` to the value of `i`, which is 7.

Output State: **`maxi` is 7, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], `mini` is 9, `n` must be greater than 1, `res` is the input string and its current value is '<'.**

This output state reflects the updated value of `maxi` while keeping all other variables unchanged.
