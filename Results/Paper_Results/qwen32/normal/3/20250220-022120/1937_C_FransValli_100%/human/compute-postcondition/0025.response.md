The code snippet provided is `arr = [i]`, which means the list `arr` is being reassigned to a new list containing the single element `i`. 

Given the initial state, `arr` was previously `[0]`. After the execution of the code, `arr` is now `[i]`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

The initial conditions for other variables remain the same: The number of test cases (int(input())) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `res` is the value of the input string; the current value of `res` is `'<'`.

Output State: **The number of test cases (int(input())) must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `maxi` is the largest value of `i` (from 1 to n-1) for which `res` was `'<'`. If `res` was never `'<'`, `maxi` is 0; `arr` is `[i]`; `res` is the value of the input string; the current value of `res` is `'<'`.**
