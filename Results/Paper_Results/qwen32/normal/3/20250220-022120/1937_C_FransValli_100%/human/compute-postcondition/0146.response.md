The given Python code snippet assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `res`. This means that the value of `res` will be whatever string is input by the user.

The initial state specifies that `maxi` is 2 if `res` is '<', otherwise `maxi` remains 0. However, since `res` is being reassigned by the input, the initial condition for `maxi` is no longer applicable in the output state. The values of `arr`, `mini`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxi` is 0, `arr` is [3, 7, 9], `mini` is 9, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `res` is an input string.**
