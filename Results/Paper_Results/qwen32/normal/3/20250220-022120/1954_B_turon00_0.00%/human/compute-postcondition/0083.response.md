The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` is either 2 or 0. If `cnt` was initially 2, it will now be 3. If `cnt` was initially 0, it will now be 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 5, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 3 and `ans` is the input integer `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is 0 if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`. `i` is 5.**
