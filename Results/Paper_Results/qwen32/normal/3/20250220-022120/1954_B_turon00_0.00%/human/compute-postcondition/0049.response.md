The given code snippet updates the value of the variable `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
