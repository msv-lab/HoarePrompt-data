Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.**
