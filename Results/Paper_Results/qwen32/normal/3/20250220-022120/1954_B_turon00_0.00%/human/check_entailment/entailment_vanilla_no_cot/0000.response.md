Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same and then outputs this length as the minimum number of elements to remove. However, this approach does not address the requirement to ensure that the resulting array is not beautiful after the removal.

The key issue is that the current program does not consider the structure of the array and the operation constraints properly. It needs to determine if there is a way to remove elements such that the array can no longer be made uniform by the specified operation. The current solution fails to account for cases where the array can still be made uniform after removing a certain number of elements.

For example, in the fourth test case, the array is `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The program will output `3` because it finds the longest sequence of `3`s, but removing three `3`s from the beginning does not make the array non-beautiful. A correct solution would need to explore different ways to remove elements and verify if the resulting array can still be made uniform.

A correct approach would involve checking different segments of the array and ensuring that after removal, no sequence can be made uniform by the specified operation. This likely involves more complex logic than simply finding the minimum length of consecutive elements.
