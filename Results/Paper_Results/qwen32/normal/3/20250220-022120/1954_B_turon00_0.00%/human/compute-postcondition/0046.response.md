Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`. If the current element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0. Additionally, `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp` in the else case.**
