Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input, `tmp` is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `cnt` is 1, and `ans` is `n`. The current element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `cnt`, which has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
