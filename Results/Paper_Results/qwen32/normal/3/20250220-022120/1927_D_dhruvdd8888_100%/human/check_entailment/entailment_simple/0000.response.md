### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first segmenting the input array `nums` into contiguous segments of identical numbers. It then processes each query by finding the segment that starts within the range `[l, r]` and checking if a valid pair of indices can be found.

However, there are several issues in the logic of the program:

1. **Indexing and Off-by-One Errors**: The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts within the range `[l, r]`, but it does not correctly handle the case where the segment starts before `l` or ends after `r`. The program incorrectly assumes that the segment found by `bisect_left` is the only segment that could contain a valid pair of indices.

2. **Handling of Single Element Segments**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the segment found by `bisect_left` is the only segment in the range `[l, r]` and contains only one element.

3. **Logic for Finding Valid Pairs**: The program's logic for finding valid pairs is flawed. It does not correctly check if there are multiple segments within the range `[l, r]` and whether any of them can form a valid pair of indices.

Let's consider the first test case from the example input:
```
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```
For the query `1 5`, the program should output `2 3` because `a_2 = 1` and `a_3 = 2` are different. However, the provided program might output `-1 -1` due to incorrect handling of segments.

### Correctness:
Given the issues described above, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
