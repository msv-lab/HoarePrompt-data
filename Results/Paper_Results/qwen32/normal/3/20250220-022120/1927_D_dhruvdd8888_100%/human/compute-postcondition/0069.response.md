The given print statement is `print(-1, -1)`. This statement directly prints the values `-1` and `-1` separated by a space. The precondition provides a detailed state of the program, including various variables and their relationships, but the print statement does not depend on any of these variables. It simply outputs the literal values `-1` and `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not require any additional computation or variable substitution based on the given initial state.

Output: **-1, -1**
