To determine the output of the `print(s - 1, s)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not directly relevant to the current print statement).
2. **`N`**: An integer read from the input.
3. **`nums`**: A list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it.
4. **`s`**: The starting index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`, where `s` is greater than `l`.
5. **`num`**: Set to -1.
6. **`arr`**: Contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`.
7. **`i`**: Set to `N + 1`.
8. **`LA`**: `len(arr) - 1`.
9. **`l` and `r`**: Two integers read from the input.
10. **`eli`**: The index where `(l, 0, 0)` can be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
11. **`e`**: The ending index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`.
12. **`s`**: Not equal to 1 and not greater than `r`.

### Key Points for the Print Statement:
- The print statement is `print(s - 1, s)`.
- `s` is the starting index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)`.
- `s` is greater than `l` and not equal to 1 and not greater than `r`.

### Determining the Output:
- `s` is the starting index of a segment in `arr` that meets certain conditions.
- Since `s` is defined as the starting index of a segment, `s` is an integer that corresponds to a position in `arr`.
- `s - 1` is simply one less than `s`.

### Conclusion:
The output will be two integers: `s - 1` and `s`, where `s` is the starting index of a segment in `arr` that is greater than `l` and not equal to 1 and not greater than `r`.

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the starting index of the segment at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and s is greater than l, not equal to 1, and not greater than r)**
