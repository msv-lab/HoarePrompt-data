The code snippet `arr.append((1 + s, i, num))` appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple consists of three elements: `1 + s`, `i`, and `num`. Given the initial state, `s` is 0, so `1 + s` becomes 1. The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the tuple, and `num` is `nums[0]`.

Since `s` is 0, `1 + s` is 1. The value of `i` is unknown from the initial state, but it is part of the tuple being appended. The value of `num` is `nums[0]`, which is the first element of the list `nums`.

Therefore, the list `arr` will now contain one tuple: `(1, i, nums[0])`.

The other variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`; `arr` is [(1, i, nums[0])]**.
