The given print statement is `print(-1, -1)`. This statement will print the values `-1` and `-1` separated by a space, regardless of the values of any other variables in the program.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The initial state provides a lot of information about the variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement is very straightforward.
2. The `print` statement explicitly specifies the values to be printed: `-1` and `-1`.
3. These values are constants and do not depend on any of the other variables or their values.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **-1, -1**
