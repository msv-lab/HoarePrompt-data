The value of `num` is assigned the first element of the list `nums`. The other variables `t`, `N`, `nums`, `s`, and `e` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `s` is 0; `e` is 0; `num` is `nums[0]`.**
