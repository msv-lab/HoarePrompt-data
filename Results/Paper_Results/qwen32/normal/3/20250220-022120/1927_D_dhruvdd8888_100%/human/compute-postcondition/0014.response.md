The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement, `i` ranges from 0 to `N` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have taken on the value that allowed the loop to execute the previous time. Since the loop iterates from `0` to `N`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been some value `k` where `0 ≤ k ≤ N`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, provided that `k + 1 ≤ N`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it.
- `num` is now `nums[i]`.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `i` is incremented by 1; `num` is now `nums[i]`.**
