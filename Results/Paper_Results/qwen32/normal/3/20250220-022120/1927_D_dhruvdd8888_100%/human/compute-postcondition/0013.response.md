The given code snippet `num = nums[i]` simply assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `num`. This means that the value of `num` will now be the element at index `i` in the list `nums`. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, `arr`) remain unchanged unless `num` changes their values in subsequent code (which is not shown here).

Given the initial state, `num` is set to `nums[i]`, and this is the only change in the output state. Therefore:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `s` is set to `i`, `e` is set to 0, `num` is set to `nums[0]`, and `arr` is updated to [(1, i, nums[0])]; otherwise, `s`, `e`, `num`, and `arr` remain unchanged; `num` is now `nums[i]`.**
