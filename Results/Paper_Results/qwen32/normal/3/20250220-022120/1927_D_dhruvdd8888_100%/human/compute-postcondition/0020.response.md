The code snippet `arr.append((1 + s, i, num))` appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple consists of three elements: `1 + s`, `i`, and `num`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `num` are not provided in the initial state, but we can infer their roles based on the code.

- `s` is an integer that, when incremented by 1, becomes the first element of the tuple.
- `i` is an integer that is the second element of the tuple.
- `num` is an integer that is the third element of the tuple.

The initial state provides information about `t`, `N`, and `nums`, but these variables are not affected by the given code snippet. The variable `i` is mentioned to be `i + 1` in the initial state, but since the code snippet does not modify `i` directly, we assume `i` is used as is in the tuple.

Therefore, after executing the code snippet, the list `arr` will have a new tuple appended to it, and the values of `t`, `N`, and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 0; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it; `i` is `i + 1`; `arr` has a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` appended to it.**
