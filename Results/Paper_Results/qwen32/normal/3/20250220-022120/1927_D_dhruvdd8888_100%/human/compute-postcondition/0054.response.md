The `print(-1, -1)` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward. It directly prints the values `-1` and `-1`, regardless of the state of any variables or objects defined in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown of the relevant parts:
- The `print` statement explicitly specifies the values `-1` and `-1` to be printed.
- The initial state provides a detailed description of various variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are involved in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the two values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
