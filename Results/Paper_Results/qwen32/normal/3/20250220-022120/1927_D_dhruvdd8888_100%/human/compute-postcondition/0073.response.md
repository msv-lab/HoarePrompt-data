Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N is an integer read from the input, nums is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it, s is the starting index of the segment at index min(eli, LA) (updated for the last iteration), num is -1, arr contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in nums, i is N + 1, LA is len(arr) - 1. The loop has executed t times, and the input value for the next iteration would be 0. The variables l, r, eli, and e are the values from the last iteration of the loop.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `t`, `N`, `nums`, `num`, `arr`, `i`, and `LA` remain unchanged from their initial definitions and updates during the loop.
- The loop has run `t` times, and there are no more iterations left.
- `s`, `eli`, and `e` hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
- `l` and `r` are the values from the last input pair processed by the loop.
