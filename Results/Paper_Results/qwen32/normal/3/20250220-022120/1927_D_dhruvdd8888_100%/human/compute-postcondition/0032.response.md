The `print(-1, -1)` statement directly prints the values `-1` and `-1` separated by a space. The initial state provides a detailed description of various variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement is independent of these variables as it explicitly specifies the values to be printed.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`.
2. This statement explicitly specifies that the values `-1` and `-1` should be printed.
3. None of the variables described in the initial state (`t`, `N`, `nums`, `s`, `num`, `arr`, `i`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `e`) are used in this `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **-1, -1**
