The given print statement is `print(-1, -1)`. This statement directly prints the values `-1` and `-1` without referencing any variables or objects from the initial state. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `N`, `nums`, `s`, `num`, `arr`, `i`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, or `e`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The print statement `print(-1, -1)` is a literal print statement.
2. It prints the values `-1` and `-1` as they are, without any computation or reference to the variables defined in the initial state.

Thus, the output is:

Output: **-1, -1**
