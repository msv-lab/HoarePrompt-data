Let's analyze the given task step by step based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `N` is an integer read from the input.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input with an additional -1 appended to it.
- `s` is the starting index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)` (updated).
- `num` is -1.
- `arr` contains tuples representing each contiguous segment of identical numbers in `nums`.
- `i` is N + 1.
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input in this iteration.
- `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` can be inserted in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
- `e` is the ending index of the segment at index `min(eli, LA)` (updated).
- The input value for the next iteration is decremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1, -1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It prints the values `-1` and `-1` directly. The values of the variables `t`, `N`, `nums`, `s`, `num`, `arr`, `i`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, and `e` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement explicitly prints `-1` and `-1`.

### Output:
Output: **-1, -1**
