Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the array `a` that satisfies the conditions specified in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly generate the array `a` such that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.

Here's a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

- The function initializes `ans` with the value `10^9` for all elements.
- Then, it iterates backward through the array `arr` (which contains the `x` values), attempting to set `ans[i]` based on `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

This approach does not guarantee that `ans[i] % ans[i - 1]` will equal `arr[i]` for all `i`. Instead, we need to construct the array `a` in a way that satisfies the modulo condition.

A correct approach would be to choose `a_1` to be a sufficiently large number (e.g., `10^9`) and then compute each subsequent `a_i` as `a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    return ans

t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1
```

In this corrected version, `a_1` is set to `10^9`, and each subsequent `a_i` is calculated as `a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i`, ensuring that the modulo condition is satisfied.
