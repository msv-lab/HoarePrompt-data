Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
We need to find an array `a` of length `n` such that:
- `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `1 <= i <= n`
- `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`

Given an array `x` of length `n-1`, the task is to construct an array `a` that satisfies the above conditions.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the array `x` of length `n-1`. It then calls the function `func_1(arr, n)` to generate the array `a`.

#### Function `func_1(arr, n)`:
- Initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to `10^9`.
- Iterates from the second last element to the first element of `ans` (i.e., from `i = n-2` to `i = 0`).
- For each `i`, it sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.

### Correctness Check
Let's evaluate if the function `func_1` correctly constructs the array `a`:

1. **Initialization**: The array `ans` is initialized with all elements set to `10^9`. This is a valid initial value as `10^9` is within the range `[1, 10^9]`.

2. **Iteration and Calculation**:
   - The function iterates from `i = n-2` down to `i = 0`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `ans[i]` as `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.
   - This calculation ensures that `ans[i] % ans[i+1] == arr[i]` because `ans[i]` is chosen such that subtracting `arr[i]` from `ans[i+1]` results in `ans[i]`.

3. **Modulo Condition**:
   - The condition `ans[i] % ans[i+1] == arr[i]` should hold for all `2 <= i <= n`.
   - Given `ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i]`, it follows that `ans[i] % ans[i+1] == (ans[i+1] - arr[i]) % ans[i+1] == -arr[i] % ans[i+1] == arr[i]` (since `arr[i] < ans[i+1]`).

4. **Range Constraint**:
   - The values in `ans` are calculated such that they remain within the range `[1, 10^9]` because the initial value is `10^9` and we are subtracting values from `x` which are at most `500`.

### Conclusion
The function `func_1` correctly constructs the array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. The program is correct.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
