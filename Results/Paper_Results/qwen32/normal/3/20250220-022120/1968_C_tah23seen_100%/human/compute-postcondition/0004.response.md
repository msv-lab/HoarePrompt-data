The code snippet `i -= 1` decrements the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` was `n - 2`. After decrementing, `i` becomes `n - 3`.

The values of `arr`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is `10 - arr[i]` and all other elements are `10`; `i` is `n - 3`.**
