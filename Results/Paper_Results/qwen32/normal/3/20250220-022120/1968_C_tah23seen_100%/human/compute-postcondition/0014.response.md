Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `x_i` ≤ 500, and an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 500 representing the length of the list `arr` plus one. It returns a list `ans` of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is `10 - arr[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-2` and `ans[n-1]` is `10`.**
