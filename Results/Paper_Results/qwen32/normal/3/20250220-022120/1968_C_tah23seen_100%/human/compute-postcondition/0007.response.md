Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \); `n` must be at least 3; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where `ans[i]` is `10 - arr[i]` for `i` not equal to `n-3`, `ans[n-3]` is `ans[n-2] - arr[n-3]`, and all other elements are `10`; `i` is `n - 4`**

In simple terms, the value of `i` has been decremented by 1, so it now equals `n - 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
