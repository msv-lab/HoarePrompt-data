Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9).
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: The final values of `x` and `y` are the last pair read, and `i` is equal to the initial value of `x`.
