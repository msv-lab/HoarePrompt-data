Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input.
- It is also specified that `x` is not less than `y`.

The `print` statement will output the values of `y` and `x` in that order. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **y, x (where y is the second integer from the input and x is the first integer from the input, with x not less than y)**
