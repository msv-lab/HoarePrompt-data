The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This changes the values of `x` and `y` from their initial state, but the value of `t` and the condition regarding `x` and `y` (whether `x` is less than `y` or not) are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `i` is not changed by this code snippet either.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` is less than `y`. Otherwise, `x` is not less than `y`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
