Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. It then iterates `t` times, each time reading two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
3. For each pair of integers, it checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.
4. This ensures that for each test case, the minimum of the two numbers is printed first, followed by the maximum.

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, processes each pair of integers, and outputs the minimum and maximum values in the correct order for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
