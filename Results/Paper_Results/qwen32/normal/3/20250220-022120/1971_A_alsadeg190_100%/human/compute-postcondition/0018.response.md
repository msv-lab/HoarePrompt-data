To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the code and the provided information step by step.

### Code Analysis:
The loop provided is:
```python
for i in range(x):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if x < y:
        print(x, y)
    else:
        print(y, x)
```

### Loop Behavior:
1. The loop runs `x` times.
2. In each iteration, the values of `x` and `y` are read from the input.
3. It then compares `x` and `y` and prints the smaller value followed by the larger value.

### Initial State:
- `t` (number of test cases) is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- For each test case, there are `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9).

### Output State after the First 3 Iterations:
- The loop runs `x` times, and for each iteration, it reads new values of `x` and `y`.
- The loop prints the smaller value followed by the larger value for each pair.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will run `x` times, each time reading a new pair of integers and printing the smaller followed by the larger.
- After all iterations, the values of `x` and `y` will be the last pair that was read and processed.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `x` (as the loop runs from `0` to `x-1`).

### Output State after All Iterations:
Since the loop runs `x` times and the values of `x` and `y` are updated in each iteration, the final state of `x` and `y` will be the last pair read. The variable `i` will be equal to `x` after the loop completes.

**Output State: **The final values of `x` and `y` will be the last pair read, and `i` will be equal to `x`. The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms: The final state will have `x` and `y` as the last pair of integers read in the last iteration of the loop, and `i` will be equal to the initial value of `x` (since the loop runs `x` times). The number of test cases `t` remains the same as it was initially.

Output State: **The final values of `x` and `y` are the last pair read, and `i` is equal to the initial value of `x`.**
