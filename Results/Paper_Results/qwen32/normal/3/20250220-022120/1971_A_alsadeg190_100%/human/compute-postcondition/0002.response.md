The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. Given the initial state, `x` must be greater than 0, and `y` can be any integer from 0 to 9. The input operation will override these initial conditions for `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input.**

In natural language: The value of `x` is now the first integer provided in the input, and the value of `y` is the second integer provided in the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
