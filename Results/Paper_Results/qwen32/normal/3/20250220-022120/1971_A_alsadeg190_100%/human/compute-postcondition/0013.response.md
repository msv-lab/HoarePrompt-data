The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `x` remains the same.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)
- `x` is the first integer from the input
- `y` is the second integer from the input
- If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` is less than `y`. Otherwise, `x` is not less than `y` and `i` is `i + 1`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `x` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `i` is `i + 1`**
