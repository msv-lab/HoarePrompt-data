Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user input, `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`, and `count` is greater than 0. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, `count` is either less than or equal to 2 or odd. If `count` is 2, the element in `a` immediately following the first occurrence of '1' is either not '1' or '1'.**
