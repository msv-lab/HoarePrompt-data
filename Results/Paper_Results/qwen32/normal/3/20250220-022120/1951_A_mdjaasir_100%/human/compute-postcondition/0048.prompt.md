Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user input, and `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`. If `count` is equal to 0, the conditions specified in the if part hold. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, `count` is either 1, 2, or odd. If `count` is 2, the element in `a` immediately following the first occurrence of '1' is either not '1' or '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user input, `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`, and `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the user input, `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`, and `i` is incremented by 1. The postcondition remains the same regardless of whether `count` is 0, greater than 2 and even, or any other value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
