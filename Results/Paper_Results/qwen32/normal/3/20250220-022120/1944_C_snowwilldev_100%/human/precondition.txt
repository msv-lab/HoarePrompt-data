The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4), which is the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), representing the size of the array a. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n), which are the elements of the array a. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
