Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to ensure the correctness of the solution based on the function summary and the original assessment.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a`.
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the resulting array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Strategy Recap:
- If there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once in `a`, Alice can ensure the MEX is at least 2.
- If there is exactly one number that appears exactly once, Alice can ensure the MEX is at least 1.
- If there are no numbers that appear exactly once, the MEX will be 0.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows a strategy to determine the MEX based on the counts of elements in `a`.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
```

### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` processes an array `a` and returns the smallest integer `i` such that:
- The count of `i` in `a` is 1, or
- The count of `i` in `a` is 0, or
- It returns `i` when it encounters at least two numbers that appear exactly once.

### Validation:
Let's validate the program against the strategy and the problem description:

1. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count occurrences of each number in `a`.

2. **Finding the MEX**:
   - The program iterates from 0 to `N` and checks the count of each number.
   - If it finds a number that appears exactly once, it increments a counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2, it means there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once, and it returns the current number `i`.
   - If it finds a number that does not appear in `a` (`cnt[i] == 0`), it returns the current number `i`.

### Edge Cases:
- **All numbers appear more than once**: The program correctly returns 0 because no number appears exactly once, and the MEX should be 0.
- **One number appears exactly once**: The program returns that number, ensuring the MEX is at least 1.
- **At least two numbers appear exactly once**: The program returns the smallest such number, ensuring the MEX is at least 2.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to determine the MEX based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob. It handles all edge cases and aligns with the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
