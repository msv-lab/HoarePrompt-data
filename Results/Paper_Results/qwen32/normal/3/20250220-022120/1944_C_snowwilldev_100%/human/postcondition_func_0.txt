The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It returns the smallest integer `i` such that the count of `i` in the array is 1, or the first integer `i` where the count of `i` is 0, or 3 if neither condition is met before reaching `i = N`.
