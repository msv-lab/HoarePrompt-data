Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N` is the number of elements in the list `a`, `i` is `N-1` after the final iteration, `a` is a list of integers, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory function `int` where each key in `cnt` corresponds to an integer in `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. `t` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N + 1):
    if cnt[i] == 1:
        t += 1
    if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
        return i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` must be at least 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory function `int`. `t` is 1, and `cnt[i]` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory function `int`, `i` is 2, and `cnt[i]` is 1. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the program returns 2. Otherwise, the program does not return and the state of `N`, `a`, `cnt`, `i`, and `t` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default factory function `int`, and `i` is 3. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the program returns 3. Otherwise, the state of `N`, `a`, `i`, and `t` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
