The code snippet `cur -= adv` subtracts the value of `adv` from `cur`. Given the initial state, the value of `cur` is initially 0, so after the operation, `cur` becomes `-adv`.

The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of `a`, `cur` is `-adv`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `adv` is 0, `ans` contains elements from `a[i - 1] - 1` down to `a[i - 1] - adv`, `j` is `adv - 1`.**
