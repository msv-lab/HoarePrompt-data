You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

    2 1

    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        cur += counter[a[i]]
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It modifies each element of the list by adding its 1-based index to it. Then, it constructs a new list `ans` that includes all unique modified elements in descending order, along with additional elements calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The task involves:
1. Given an array `a` of length `n`, perform `n` operations where each operation involves selecting an index `i`, inserting `a[i] + i` into a set `S`, and deleting `a[i]` from `a`.
2. After all operations, construct an array `b` which is the set `S` sorted in decreasing order.
3. The goal is to find the lexicographically largest possible array `b`.

### Key Points

- The set `S` only contains unique elements.
- The optimal strategy to maximize the lexicographically largest `b` involves inserting the largest possible values into `S` first.
- Since the set `S` only contains unique elements, selecting the same index `i` multiple times might result in duplicate values, which are not added to `S`.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array `a` and the elements of `a`.

2. **Modifying Array `a`:**
   - For each element `a[i]`, it adds `i + 1` to it. This is done in a loop that iterates `n` times.
   - This step correctly modifies the array `a` according to the problem statement.

3. **Using a Counter:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each modified element in `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in reverse order.

4. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted set `a` and constructs the array `b` by appending elements from the set.
   - It also handles the case where there are duplicate elements by appending the appropriate number of decremented values to `b`.

5. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program calculates the number of duplicates (`cnt`) and appends the appropriate decremented values to `b` to account for these duplicates.

### Correctness Check

- **Modification of `a`:** The program correctly modifies `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element.
- **Unique Elements:** The use of a set ensures that only unique elements are added to `S`.
- **Sorting:** The program sorts the unique elements in decreasing order, which is necessary to construct the lexicographically largest `b`.
- **Handling Duplicates:** The program correctly handles duplicates by appending the appropriate number of decremented values to `b`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the steps required to solve the problem and constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
