The code snippet `ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)` appends a new value to the list `ans`. The value being appended is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. Since `j` is not defined in the initial state, we'll assume `j` is a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the code and is used in this context.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `ans` because a new element is added to it. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `i`, `cur`, `cnt`, `adv`) remain unchanged unless they are explicitly modified in the code snippet, which they are not.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2, `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)` and greater than 0, `ans` contains a new element `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.**
