To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the variables involved.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
```
This loop will execute `cnt` times. Each time it executes, it appends the last element of `ans` minus 1 to `ans`. 

Given the state after the first three iterations:
- `cnt` is 1 after three iterations.
- `ans` has the original elements of `a` followed by additional elements calculated as the previous last element of `ans` minus 1.

Since `cnt` is 1 after three iterations, the loop will execute one more time, making the total number of iterations `cnt + 3`. After the third iteration, `cnt` is 1, so the loop will execute one more time and then terminate.

Let's break down the final state:
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
- `counter` has each element in `a` with a count of -1.
- `cur` is 0.
- `cnt` is 0 after the loop finishes (since it starts at 1 and decrements each iteration).
- `ans` will have the original elements of `a` plus four additional elements, each being the previous last element of `ans` minus 1.

Let's illustrate this with an example:
Suppose `a = [5, 3, 8]` and initially `ans = [5, 3, 8]`.
- After 1st iteration: `ans = [5, 3, 8, 7]`
- After 2nd iteration: `ans = [5, 3, 8, 7, 6]`
- After 3rd iteration: `ans = [5, 3, 8, 7, 6, 5]`
- After 4th iteration: `ans = [5, 3, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4]`

The final state of `ans` will be the original elements of `a` plus four additional elements calculated as described.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` remains greater than 0, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `counter` has each element in `a` with a count of -1, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` contains all elements of `a` in their original order plus four additional elements calculated during the loop based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, and an additional element which is the last element of the previous `ans` minus 1.**
