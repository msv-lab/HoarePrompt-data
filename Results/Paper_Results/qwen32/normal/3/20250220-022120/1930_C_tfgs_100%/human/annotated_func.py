#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of array a, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing `n` integers where `a_1` is `a_1 + 1`, `a_2` is `a_2 + 2`, `a_3` is `a_3 + 3`, ..., `a_n` is `a_n + n`, `i` is `n-1`.
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: `n` remains greater than 0, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `counter` has each element in `a` with a count of -1, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` contains all elements of `a` in their original order plus any additional elements calculated during the loop based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `n` remains greater than 0, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `counter` has each element in `a` with a count of -1, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` contains all elements of `a` in their original order plus four additional elements calculated during the loop based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, and an additional element which is the last element of the previous `ans` minus 1.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: all elements of `a` in their original order, followed by four additional elements calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, and finally an element which is the last element of the previous `ans` minus 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It modifies each element of the list by adding its 1-based index to it. Then, it constructs a new list `ans` that includes all unique modified elements in descending order, along with additional elements calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans`.
