Output State: **`n` remains greater than 0; `a` remains unchanged; if `i > 0`, `ans` includes `adv` additional elements: `a[i - 1] - 0 - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1` and now includes `a[i]`; `counter[a[i]]` is -2 for the specific `i`; `cur` is the sum of all `counter[a[i]]` values minus `adv` minus 1; `i` is equal to the length of `a`; `adv` is 0; `cnt` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: The value of `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, changing it from -1 to -2 for the specific `i`. The value of `cur` is now the previous sum of all `counter[a[i]]` values minus `adv` minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
