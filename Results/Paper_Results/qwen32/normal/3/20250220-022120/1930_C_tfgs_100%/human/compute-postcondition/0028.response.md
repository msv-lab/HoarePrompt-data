The code snippet `ans.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the list `ans`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2.
- If `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of `a`, `cur` is `-adv`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `adv` is 0, and `ans` contains elements from `a[i - 1] - 1` down to `a[i - 1] - adv`.
- If `i` is 0, `cur`, `adv`, `j`, and the contents of `ans` remain unchanged.

The only change made by the code snippet is appending `a[i]` to `ans`. Therefore, the new state of `ans` will include the element `a[i]` at the end.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers derived from the original list where each element `a_i` is incremented by its 1-based index, sorted in descending order, and the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2; `ans` contains its previous elements plus `a[i]`.**
