The code snippet provided initializes a variable `k` to 0. No other variables are altered in the given code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input line where 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is 0**.
