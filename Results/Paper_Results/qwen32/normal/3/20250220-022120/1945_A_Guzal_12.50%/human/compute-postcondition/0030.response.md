Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input line where 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`. If `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0`, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` is updated to `k + a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k + a + (b + c) // 3`.**
