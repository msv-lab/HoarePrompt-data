The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `k`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input line where 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` is 0.**
