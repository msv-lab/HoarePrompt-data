Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input line where 0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 10^9, `n` is greater than 0, and `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`. If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, then `k` is incremented by 1. Additionally, either `b % 3 == 0` or `c >= 3` or `(b + c) % 3 == 0` holds true.**
