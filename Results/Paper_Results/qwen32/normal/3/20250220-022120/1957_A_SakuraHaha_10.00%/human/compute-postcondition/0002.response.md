Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. `n` is an input integer. `a` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks. `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
