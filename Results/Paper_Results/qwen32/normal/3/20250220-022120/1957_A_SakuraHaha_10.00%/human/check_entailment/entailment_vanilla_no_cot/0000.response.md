Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it only checks for the maximum number of squares (4-sided polygons) that can be formed, not the maximum number of regular polygons of any number of sides. 

The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons of any number of sides that can be formed simultaneously using the given sticks. The current implementation only considers polygons with 4 sides (squares). It does not account for other regular polygons such as equilateral triangles (3 sides), hexagons (6 sides), etc.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should consider all possible regular polygons that can be formed with the sticks, not just squares.
