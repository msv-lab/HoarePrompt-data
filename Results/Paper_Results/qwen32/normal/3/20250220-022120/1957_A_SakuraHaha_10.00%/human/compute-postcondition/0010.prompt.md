Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. `n` is an input integer. `a` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks. `ans` is 0. `cnt` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1 (or any integer between 1 and 100, inclusive), `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with the count of `x` incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1 (or any integer between 1 and 100, inclusive), `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with the count of `x` incremented by 2, `x` is the second element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1 (or any integer between 1 and 100, inclusive), `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with the count of `x` incremented by 3, `x` is the third element in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
