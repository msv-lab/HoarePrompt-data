Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sticks, `a` is the list of stick lengths, `ans` is `ans + x_current // 4 + x // 4`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one unique stick length and its count in `a`, `x` is the next value from `cnt.values()` after `x_current`. The value of `ans` is now `ans + x // 4`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `x // 4` to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
