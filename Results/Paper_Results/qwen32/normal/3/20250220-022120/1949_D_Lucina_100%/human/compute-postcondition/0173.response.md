To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `nx` is a string that is constructed by processing each character of the first line of input according to some rules provided in a loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(nx)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `nx` is constructed based on the processing of the first line of input. However, the specific rules or transformations applied to the input to construct `nx` are not provided in the initial state.
- Therefore, we can only describe `nx` in terms of its construction process rather than its exact value.

### Output:
Since we don't have the specific rules for constructing `nx` and the exact input string, we can only describe `nx` as the result of processing the first line of input.

Output: **nx (where nx is the string constructed by processing each character of the first line of input according to the rules provided in the loop)**
