The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `j-1` of the string `xx[i]` to the existing string `nx`. 

Given the initial state, `nx` is initially set based on certain conditions, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is the character at the position right before `j` in the `i`-th line of input (considering `xx` is a list of strings).

Since `nx` is initially set to either 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions provided, and the code appends `xx[i][j - 1]` to it, the new value of `nx` will be the initial value of `nx` concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`.

Thus, the updated state of `nx` will be `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 1, `nx` is `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`.**
