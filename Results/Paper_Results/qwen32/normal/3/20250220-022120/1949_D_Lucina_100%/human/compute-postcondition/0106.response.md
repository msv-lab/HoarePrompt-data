The code snippet `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `sb`. Given that `i` is 4, the list `sb` will now include the value 4. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input. If `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sa` includes the value 4. Otherwise, `sa` remains unchanged. `sb` contains the single element `i` if `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and `sb` now also contains the new element `i` if the condition `b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0` is true, and now `sb` includes the value 4. `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is 4.**
