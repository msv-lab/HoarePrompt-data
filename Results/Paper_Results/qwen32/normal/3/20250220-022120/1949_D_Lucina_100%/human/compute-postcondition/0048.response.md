The code snippet increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the value of `b[2]` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and the other elements of `b` (except `b[2]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `j` is 2, and `b[2]` is incremented by 1.**
