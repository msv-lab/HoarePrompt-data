Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `nx` is increased by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `nx` is increased by the value found at `xx[i][j - 1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain as described in the initial state, with `i` and `j` each incremented by 1 from their previous values.
