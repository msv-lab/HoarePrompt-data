Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `b` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `b[1]` is 2, `xx` is a list containing a single empty string, `x` is the value of the user's input, and `x[j - 1]` is 'S'**

In this output state, the only change is that the value of `b[j]` has been incremented by 1, making `b[1]` equal to 2, as it was initially 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
