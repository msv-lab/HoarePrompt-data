The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing string `nx`. Given that `nx` is initially an empty string, after executing the code, `nx` will be equal to 'F'. The values of `i`, `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the condition regarding `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', and neither `i` nor `j` is in the list `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`**.
