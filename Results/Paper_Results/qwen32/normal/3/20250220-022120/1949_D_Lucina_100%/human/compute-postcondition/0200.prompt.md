Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]:
            nx += 'F'
        else:
            nx += 'S'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally all indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is a string of length `n` built based on the characters from `xx[i]` and the conditions involving `sa`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nx` is a string constructed by processing each character of the first line of input according to the rules provided in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nx` is a string of length `n` constructed by appending characters from `xx[i][j - 1]` or 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
