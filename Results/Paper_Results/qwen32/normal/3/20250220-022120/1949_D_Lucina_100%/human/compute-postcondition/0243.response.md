The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given that `nx` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `nx` will contain the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged as per the given conditions.

Output State: **`nx` is the character `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'**.
