The code snippet `sa.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `sa`. Therefore, the list `sa` will now include the new index `i` at the end of its existing elements. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `sa` originally contains indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally the current index `i` if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. After appending `i`, `sa` will have one more element, which is the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and additionally the current index `i` if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, plus the new index `i`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, `t` is the length of `sa`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is the previous `i` value plus 1.**
