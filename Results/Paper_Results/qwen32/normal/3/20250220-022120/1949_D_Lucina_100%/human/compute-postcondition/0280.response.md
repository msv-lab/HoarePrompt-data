The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing value of `nx`. The other variables `i`, `n`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration), `nx` is updated to be the previous value of `nx` with 'F' appended to it.**
