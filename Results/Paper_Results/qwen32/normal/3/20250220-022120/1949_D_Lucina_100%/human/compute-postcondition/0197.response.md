Postcondition: **`nx` is a string, `i` is unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `xx[i][j - 1]` is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx` if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, and 'S' is appended to `nx` otherwise.**
