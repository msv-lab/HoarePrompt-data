The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the element at index `j - 1` of the list `xx[i]` to the string `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` is initially a string, `i` is unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

After executing the code, `nx` will be updated to include the new string element from `xx[i][j - 1]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged except that `j` was incremented by 1 before this operation, so it retains its incremented value.

Output State: **`nx` is a string that includes `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to it, `i` is unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.
