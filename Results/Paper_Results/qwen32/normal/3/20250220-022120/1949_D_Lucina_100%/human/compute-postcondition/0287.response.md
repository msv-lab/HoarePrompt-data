Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `i` or `j` is found in the list `sb` up to the index `n // 4 - 1`, `nx` has 'S' appended to it. Otherwise, `nx` has 'F' appended to it.**
