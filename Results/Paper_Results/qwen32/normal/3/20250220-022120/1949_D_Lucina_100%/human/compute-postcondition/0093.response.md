The code snippet appends the current index `i` to the list `sa`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'F' characters per column, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with counts of 'S' characters per column, `xx` is a list containing an empty string followed by the `n` lines of input, `sa` is a list containing the current index `i`, `sb` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, and at the current index `i`, `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is equal to 0.**
