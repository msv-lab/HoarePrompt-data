The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range `1, n + 1`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range it is iterating over.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented to 2.

The state of `n` does not need to be adjusted because it is a constant input value that defines the range of the loop.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 24, `j` is 2**
