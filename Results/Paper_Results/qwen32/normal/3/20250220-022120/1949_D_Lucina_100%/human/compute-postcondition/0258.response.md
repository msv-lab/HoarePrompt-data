The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at index `j - 1` of the string `xx[i]` to the string `nx`. 

Given the initial state, `nx` is a string, `i` has been incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` retains its value from the start of the previous iteration.

After executing the code, `nx` will be updated to include the new character from `xx[i][j - 1]`.

Output State: **`nx` is a string with `xx[i][j - 1]` appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is the value of `j` at the start of the previous iteration.**
