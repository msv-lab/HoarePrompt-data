The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `nx` has 'F' appended to it.**
