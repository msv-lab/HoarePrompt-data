You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Output

    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna

    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    
Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of integers) and `m` (parameter determining when Sasha wins).
   - It then reads the list of integers.

2. **Reversing Digits:**
   - The program reverses the digits of each integer in the list.
   - If the length of the reversed number is the same as the original number (no leading zeros removed), it concatenates it directly to `rev_res`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the reversed number to the list `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting and Concatenation:**
   - The program sorts the list `rev_val`.
   - It then alternates between appending the integer and its reverse to `rev_res` based on the index (even or odd).

4. **Determine Winner:**
   - The program checks if the final concatenated number `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `10^m`.
   - If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Leading Zeros:**
   - The program does not correctly handle leading zeros when reversing numbers. For example, reversing `1580` should result in `851`, not `0851`. The program does not remove leading zeros.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Concatenation:**
   - The program does not correctly simulate the game's rules. Sasha can concatenate any two numbers in any order, not necessarily alternating with Anna's moves.
   - The program does not consider Sasha's optimal strategy of concatenating numbers to maximize the final result.

3. **Incorrect Sorting and Concatenation Logic:**
   - The program sorts `rev_val` and alternates between appending and reversing elements, which does not reflect the actual game rules.
   - The program does not simulate Sasha's optimal moves of concatenating any two numbers.

4. **Incorrect Final Check:**
   - The program checks if the final concatenated number `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `10^m`, but this does not consider the optimal strategies of both players.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly simulate the game's rules and does not consider the optimal strategies of both players. Therefore, it is incorrect.
