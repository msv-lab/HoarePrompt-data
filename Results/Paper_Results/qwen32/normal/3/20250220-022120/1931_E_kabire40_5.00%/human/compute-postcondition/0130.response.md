Output State: **`rev_res` is a concatenation of all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` equals the length of `x[::-1]`, followed by the reverse of `val_in`; `y` is `y_initial + n`; `rev_val` is a sorted list of `x[::-1]` for all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` does not equal the length of `x[::-1]` and must have at least one element; `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` retain their initial values; `x` is an odd integer; `val_in` is the element at index `x` in `rev_val`.**

In natural language: The `rev_res` variable now includes the reverse of `val_in` appended to its previous value. All other variables retain their initial values.
