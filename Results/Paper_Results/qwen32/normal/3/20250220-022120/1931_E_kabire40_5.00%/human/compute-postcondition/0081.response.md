Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the next input by spaces, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is the same as the original string, followed by either the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the reversed version of the string at the `x`-th index of `rev_val` if `x` is odd, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is different from the original string, sorted in ascending order with at least one element, and `val_in` is either the integer value of the `x`-th element of `rev_val` if `x` is even, or the string at the `x`-th index of `rev_val` if `x` is odd.**
