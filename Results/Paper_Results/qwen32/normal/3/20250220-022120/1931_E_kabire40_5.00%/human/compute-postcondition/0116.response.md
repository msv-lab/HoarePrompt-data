Postcondition: **`rev_res` is `2 * x` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x` and `x > 10`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is `x`. `y` is [previous value of y] + 1. `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is an empty list if `x_rev` was not equal to `x` in length; otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`. `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x`, and `x_rev` retain their initial values.**
