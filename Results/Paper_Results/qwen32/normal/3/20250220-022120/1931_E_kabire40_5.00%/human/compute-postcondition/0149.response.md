Postcondition: **`rev_res` is a concatenation of all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` equals the length of `x[::-1]`, followed by the string representation of `int(rev_val[x])` if `x` is even, or the reverse of `rev_val[x]` if `x` is odd, for all `x` in the range of `len(rev_val)`. `y` is `y_initial + n`. `rev_val` is a sorted list of `x[::-1]` for all `x` in `operational_list` where the length of `x` does not equal the length of `x[::-1]`. `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` retain their initial values. If `10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res)`, then an additional condition is met in the if part; otherwise, the else part is executed without any additional changes to the variables.**
