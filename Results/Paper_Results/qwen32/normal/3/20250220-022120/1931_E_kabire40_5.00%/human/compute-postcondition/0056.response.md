The code snippet provided reverses the string `x` and converts it to an integer, which is then assigned to the variable `x_rev`. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Given that `x` is the first string in `operational_list`, `x_rev` will hold the integer value of the reversed string `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the next input by spaces and must have at least one string, `x` is the first string in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`.**
