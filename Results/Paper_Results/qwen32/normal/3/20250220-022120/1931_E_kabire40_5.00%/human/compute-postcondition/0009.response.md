Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input by spaces and must contain at least one element, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `operational_list[0]`, and the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of `x`**
