Postcondition: **`rev_res` is the concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is the same as the original string, followed by the processed elements of `rev_val` as described above. Additionally, `rev_res` is greater than `10` raised to the power of `max_power`.**
