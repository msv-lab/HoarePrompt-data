Output State: **`rev_res` is an empty string; `y` is [previous value of y] + 1; `rev_val` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The value of `rev_res` is explicitly set to an empty string. The value of `y` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. The value of `rev_val` remains an empty list as it was initially. All other conditions and states remain unchanged.
