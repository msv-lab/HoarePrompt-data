Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the next input by spaces, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is the same as the original string, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is different from the original string, and `rev_val` is sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the next input by spaces, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is the same as the original string, followed by either the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the reversed version of the string at the `x`-th index of `rev_val` if `x` is odd, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is different from the original string, sorted in ascending order with at least one element, and `val_in` is either the integer value of the `x`-th element of `rev_val` if `x` is even, or the string at the `x`-th index of `rev_val` if `x` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the next input by spaces, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is the same as the original string, followed by either the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the reversed version of the string at the `x`-th index of `rev_val` if `x` is odd. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is further concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`, and `val_in` is the integer value of the `x`-th element of `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is further concatenated with the reversed version of `val_in`, and `val_in` is the string at the `x`-th index of `rev_val`. `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is different from the original string, sorted in ascending order with at least one element, and `x` is the current index + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input split by space, `max_power` is the second part of the input split by space, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the next input by spaces, `rev_res` is a concatenation of all original strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is the same as the original string, followed by either the string representation of `val_in` if `x` is even, or the reversed version of the string at the `x`-th index of `rev_val` if `x` is odd. If `x` is even, `rev_res` includes the string representation of `val_in` appended to it, and `val_in` is the integer value of the `x`-th element of `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` includes the reversed version of `val_in`, and `val_in` is the element at index `x` of `rev_val`. `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings `x` from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is different from the original string, sorted in ascending order with at least one element, and `x` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
