Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 integer; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` having the value 1.**

In natural language: The dictionary `d` now contains the key `i` with the value 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
