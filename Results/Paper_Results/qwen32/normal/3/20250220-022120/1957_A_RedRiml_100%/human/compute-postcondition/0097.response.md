The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. 

Given the initial state, the only variable that is directly affected by this code is `d`. Specifically, the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1. 

All other variables retain their initial values or states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` contains `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary with `d[i]` incremented by 1, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, `i` is `i_next`**.
