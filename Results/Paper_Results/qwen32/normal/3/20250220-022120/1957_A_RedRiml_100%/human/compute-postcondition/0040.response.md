To determine what will be printed in the given code snippet, we need to understand the initial state provided. However, the initial state does not specify what `shapes` is. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `shapes` itself.

Since there is no explicit value or description given for `shapes` in the initial state, we cannot provide a specific value for what will be printed. The most precise description we can give is that the code will print whatever value `shapes` holds.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the value of the variable `shapes`)**
