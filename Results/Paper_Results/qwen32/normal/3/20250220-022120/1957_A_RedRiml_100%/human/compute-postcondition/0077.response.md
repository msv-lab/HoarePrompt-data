Output State: **`w` is `w_initial + n`, `ln` is the input integer, `palka` is the input list of integers, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary with each unique element from `palka` as keys and their counts as values, `j` is the third element in `pl`, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3`.**

Natural Language Explanation: 
The value of `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the count of the third unique element in `palka` (which is `d[j]`) by 3. All other variables retain their initial values.
