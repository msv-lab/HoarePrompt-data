The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is the iteration variable for the loop. According to the code, `i` takes on the value of the next element in the list `palka` in each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100;
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100;
- `w` is greater than 0;
- `ln` is an input integer;
- `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 integer;
- `pl` is a list that may or may not contain `i` as its last element depending on whether `i` was not in `pl` initially;
- `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value of 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None` before the if-else block, or the value of the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None`;
- `i` is the next element in `palka`. If `i` was not in `pl`, then `pl` now contains `i` as its last element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next element in `palka` if there are more elements left in `palka`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `ln`, `pl`, and `d`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next value of `i` from `palka`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input that must have at least 1 integer; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain `i` as its last element depending on whether `i` was not in `pl` initially; `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` has a value of 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None` before the if-else block, or the value of the key `i` in `d` is incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None`; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.**
