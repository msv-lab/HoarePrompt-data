The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` from the iterable `palka`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next element in the list `palka`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `w` is `w_initial + n - 1`
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element
- `pl` contains `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`
- `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` becomes `{i: 1}`. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.
- `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.

Since the loop iterates over `palka`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in `palka` after the current `i`. However, the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not explicitly given, so we'll denote the next element in `palka` as `i_next`.

State: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` contains `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`, `i` is `i_next`**
