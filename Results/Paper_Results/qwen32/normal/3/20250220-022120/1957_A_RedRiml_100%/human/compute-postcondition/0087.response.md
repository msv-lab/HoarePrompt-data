Postcondition: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is [], `d` is {}, `shapes` will be incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`. The current value of `d.get(i)` is `None`.**
