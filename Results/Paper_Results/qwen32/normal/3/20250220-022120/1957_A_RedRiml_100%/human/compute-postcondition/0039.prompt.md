Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input; `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared; `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`; `shapes` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += d[j] // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input; `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 1 element; `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for the current key `j` in `d`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input; `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 1 element; `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`; if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for the current key `j` in `d`; otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged; `j` is the next element in `pl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers derived from the input; `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 1 element; `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is incremented by `d[j] // 3` for the current key `j` in `d`. `j` is the next element in `pl`. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged and `j` is still the next element in `pl`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
