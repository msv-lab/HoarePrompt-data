To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which in this case is `for i in palka:`. This means we can only adjust the state of `palka` to ensure the loop can execute.

Let's analyze the given state and the loop:

State before the loop starts:
- `w` is `w_initial + n - 1`
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a new list of integers from the input
- `pl` is an empty list `[]`
- `d` is an empty dictionary `{}`
- `shapes` will be incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`

The loop:
```
for i in palka:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `palka` contains at least one element. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `palka` must be a list with at least one integer.

State: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is [], `d` is {}, `shapes` will be incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`**
