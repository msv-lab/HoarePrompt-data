Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `ln` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, meaning it will hold an integer input from the user. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `w`) remain unchanged as per the given initial state.
