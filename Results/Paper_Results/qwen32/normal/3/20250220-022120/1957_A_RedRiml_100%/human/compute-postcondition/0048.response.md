The code snippet `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `d` was initially an empty dictionary, after this operation, `d` will contain one key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is `1`. The values of the other variables (`w`, `ln`, `palka`, and `pl`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers with at least one element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` and the value `1`**.
