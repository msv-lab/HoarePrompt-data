The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The initial state specifies that `d.get(i)` is `None`, meaning `i` was not a key in `d` before. After the assignment, `d[i]` will be `1`.

Other variables like `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, and `shapes` are not affected by this code snippet and retain their initial state.

Output State: **`w` is `w_initial + n - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is [], `d` is {`i`: 1}, `shapes` will be incremented by `d[j] // 3` for each unique element `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`.**
