Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least three elements; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, where the element at index `i` is 3 and all other elements are 0.**

Explanation: The value at index `i` in the list `cntl` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other elements and variables remain unchanged.
