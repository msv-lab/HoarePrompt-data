The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the list `cntl` by 1. Given that `cntl` is initially a list of `n + 1` zeros, after the execution of this line, the element at index `i` in `cntl` will be 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and the other elements in `cntl` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `cntl[i]` which is 1.**
