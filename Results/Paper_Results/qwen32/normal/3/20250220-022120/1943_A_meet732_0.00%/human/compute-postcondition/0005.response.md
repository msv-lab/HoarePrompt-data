The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at the index `i` of the list `cntl` by 1. The initial state specifies that `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. After executing the code, the element at index `i` in `cntl` will be 1 (since it was 0 before and is incremented by 1).

Other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0.**
