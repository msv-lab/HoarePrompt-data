The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cntl[i]` is 1, so after the operation, `cntl[i]` becomes 2. All other elements in `cntl` remain 0, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `cntl[i]` which is 2, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**.
