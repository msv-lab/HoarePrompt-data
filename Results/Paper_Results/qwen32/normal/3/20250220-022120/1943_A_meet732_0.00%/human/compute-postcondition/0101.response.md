Postcondition: **`cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`. The first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not equal to 0; `c` is either -1 or 0; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 2. If `not c` or `j == n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of `cntl`, `c`, `n`, and `j` remains unchanged.**
