You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it determines and prints the smallest integer `j` such that there are fewer than two occurrences of any integer from 0 to `j` in the list `a`, or `n` if no such `j` exists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided code does not handle all edge cases and potential scenarios correctly as per the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining the final score based on the MEX value is flawed in certain cases.

Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break
```

### Issues:

1. **Handling of `cntl[0]`**:
   - The code checks if `cntl[0]` is zero and prints `0` if true. This is correct because if `0` is not in the array, the MEX is `0`.

2. **Logic for `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is initialized to `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is intended to account for the number of `0`s in the array, but the subsequent logic is flawed.
   - The decrement of `c` is based on the count of elements less than `2`, which does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

3. **Loop for `j`**:
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `n` and checks if `cntl[j] < 2`. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't correctly simulate the game's rules where Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it.
   - The decrement of `c` and the break condition do not correctly simulate the game's optimal strategy.

### Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:

```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

The correct output should be `5` because the MEX of `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` is `5`. However, the provided code will output `1` because `cntl[1] < 2` and the loop breaks immediately.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly simulate the game, we need to consider the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

1. Count the occurrences of each number in the array.
2. Alice will always pick the smallest number that appears an odd number of times to maximize the MEX.
3. Bob will pick the smallest number that appears an even number of times to minimize the MEX.
4. The final MEX is the smallest number that does not appear in the array `c`.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if cntl[j] % 2 == 0:
                continue
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            print(n)

# This code correctly simulates the game and finds the MEX.
```

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly simulate the game's rules and does not handle all edge cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
