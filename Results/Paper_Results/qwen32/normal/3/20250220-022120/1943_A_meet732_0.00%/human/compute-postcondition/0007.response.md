The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the element at index `i` of the list `cntl` by 1. Initially, `cntl` has `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0. After executing the code, the element at index `i` will be 2, and all other elements will remain 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least two elements; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, where the element at index `i` is 2 and all other elements are 0.**
