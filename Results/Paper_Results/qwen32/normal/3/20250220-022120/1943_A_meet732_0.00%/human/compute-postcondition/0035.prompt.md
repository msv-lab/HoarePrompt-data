Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0; `c` is the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        c -= 1
        if not c or j == n:
            print(j)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0] - 1`. If the condition `not c or j == n` is true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `cntl[j]` is not less than 2, the value of `c` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is updated to the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0] - 1`. If `cntl[j]` is not less than 2, the value of `c` remains unchanged. `j` is incremented by 1. If `not c` or `j == n` is true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 1; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, where each element at index `i` is the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `a`. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `cntl[j] < 2`, then `c` is decremented by 1 from its previous value, and if `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
