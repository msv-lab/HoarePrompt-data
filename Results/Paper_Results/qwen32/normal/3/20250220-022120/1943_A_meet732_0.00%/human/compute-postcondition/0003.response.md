The code snippet creates a list `cntl` with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` is still a list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0.**
