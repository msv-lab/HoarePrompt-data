Postcondition: **`cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the program does not modify `cntl`. Otherwise, the value of `j` when the loop terminates (either because `c` becomes 0 or `j` reaches `n`) is determined.**
