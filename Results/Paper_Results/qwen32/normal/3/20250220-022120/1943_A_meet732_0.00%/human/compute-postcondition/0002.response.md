The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`. 

Given that `n` is an input integer, it likely represents the number of integers to be read from the input. However, `n` itself is not affected by the code snippet provided. The variable `t` is also not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
