The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the list `cntl` by 1. Given the initial state, `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. After executing the code, the value at index `i` of `cntl` will be 1, while all other elements in `cntl` remain 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0.**
