To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the effect of the loop on the `cntl` list. The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a` and increments the corresponding index `i` in the `cntl` list by 1.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first few iterations, we can infer the following:

- `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.
- `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.
- `a` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.
- `cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. After each iteration, the element at the index corresponding to the current element in `a` is incremented by 1.

After all iterations, the `cntl` list will reflect the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. Specifically, `cntl[i]` will be the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.

**Output State:** The final state of `cntl` will be such that `cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.

Therefore, the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`cntl` is a list of integers with `n + 1` elements where `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`.**
