The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers.
- `c` is either 0 or 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is 1.
- If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is set to 0 or `j` equals `n`, in which case we break out of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`cntl` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`. The first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not equal to 0; `c` is either 0 or 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is set to 0 or `j` equals `n`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
