To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`**: At least 1.
2. **`cntl`**: A list where `cntl[i]` is the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. It is also specified that `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
3. **`c`**: The minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0] - 1`.
4. **`cntl[j]`**: Less than 2.
5. **`c` or `j`**: Either `c` is False or `j` is equal to `n`.

### Analysis:
- `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, which means `cntl[0]` is at least 1.
- `c` is calculated as the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0] - 1`. Since `cntl[0]` is at least 1, `cntl[0] - 1` is at least 0. Therefore, `c` can be:
  - 0 if `cntl[0] - 1` is 0 or 1 (since the minimum between 2 and a number less than 2 is the number itself).
  - 2 if `cntl[0] - 1` is 2 or more.
- `cntl[j]` is less than 2.
- The condition `c` or `j` means that either `c` is False (which would mean `c` is 0, because in Python, 0 is considered False in a boolean context) or `j` is equal to `n`.

Given that `c` is calculated as the minimum between 2 and `cntl[0] - 1`, `c` can only be 0 if `cntl[0]` is 1 or 2. If `cntl[0]` is 1, `c` is 0. If `cntl[0]` is 2, `c` is also 0 because `cntl[0] - 1` is 1, and the minimum between 2 and 1 is 1, but since `c` is defined as the minimum between 2 and `cntl[0] - 1`, `c` will be 0 if `cntl[0]` is 2 or less.

Since `c` can be 0, and `c` being 0 means `c` is False in a boolean context, the condition `c` or `j` being True means `j` must be equal to `n` if `c` is 0.

Therefore, given the conditions, `j` must be equal to `n`.

### Conclusion:
The variable `j` is equal to `n` based on the provided conditions.

Output: **n (where n is at least 1)**
