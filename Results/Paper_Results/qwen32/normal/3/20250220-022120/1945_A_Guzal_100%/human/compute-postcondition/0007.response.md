The code snippet `k += a + (b + c) // 3` affects the variable `k` by incrementing it with the value of `a` plus the integer division of `b + c` by 3. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Given the initial conditions, the new value of `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`.**
