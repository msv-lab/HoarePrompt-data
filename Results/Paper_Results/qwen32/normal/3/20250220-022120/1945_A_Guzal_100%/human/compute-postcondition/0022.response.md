Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input integers; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 1. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to `k` + `a` + (`b` + `c`) // 3, and if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, `k` is incremented by 1.**
