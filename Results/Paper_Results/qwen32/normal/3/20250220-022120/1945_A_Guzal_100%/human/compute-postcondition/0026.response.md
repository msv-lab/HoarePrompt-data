The `print(-1)` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `i`, or `k` mentioned in the initial state. The statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, `i`, `k`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `-1`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
