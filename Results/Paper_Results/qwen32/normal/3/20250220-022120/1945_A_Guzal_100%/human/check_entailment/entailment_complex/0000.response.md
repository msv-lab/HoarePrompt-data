### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate introverts, extroverts, and universals according to their preferences. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic the program should follow:

1. **Introverts**: Each introvert must be in a tent alone. Therefore, if there are `a` introverts, at least `a` tents are required.
2. **Extroverts**: Each extrovert wants to be in a tent with two others, meaning each tent for extroverts should contain exactly three people. If there are `b` extroverts, they need to be grouped into tents of three. If `b` is not a multiple of 3, there will be leftover extroverts who cannot be accommodated according to their preferences.
3. **Universals**: Universals can be placed in any tent, so they can be used to fill any remaining spots in tents.

The logic in the program can be summarized as follows:
- First, check if the number of extroverts (`b`) can be perfectly grouped into tents of three. If not (`b % 3 != 0`), check if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to fill up the tents. If `b % 3 + c < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, and it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. In this case, the program outputs `-1`.
- If it is possible to accommodate the extroverts, the program calculates the number of tents needed for introverts (`a`) and the number of tents needed for the extroverts and universals (`(b + c) // 3`). If there are any remaining people after forming groups of three from `b + c` (`(b + c) % 3 != 0`), an additional tent is required to accommodate them.

The program correctly implements this logic and handles the constraints provided in the problem.
