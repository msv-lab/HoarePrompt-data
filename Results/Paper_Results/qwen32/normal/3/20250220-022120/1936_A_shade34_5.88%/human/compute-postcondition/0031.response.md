The code appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given that `i` is `n-1`, `pans` will now contain the value `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<', `i` is `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing `[n-1]`, `s` is the input string, `s` is not equal to '<', and `s` is equal to '='**
