The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all output is written to the standard output immediately. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `len(pans) + 1`, `mak2` is 0, `i` is `len(pans) + 1`**.
