Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any direct input parameters but interacts with an external system to receive the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, an integer `n` and a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can query the system to compare bitwise OR operations on elements of the permutation and must find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized. The function should then output the indices `i` and `j` in the format "! i j" without exceeding 3n queries per test case.**
