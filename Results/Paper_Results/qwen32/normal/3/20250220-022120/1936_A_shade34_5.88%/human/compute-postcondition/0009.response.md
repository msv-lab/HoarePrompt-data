The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0. The value of `i` at the end of the last iteration was such that the loop condition `i < n` was satisfied, and now `i` has been incremented by 1.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, since we need to specify the exact state at the start of the next iteration, let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is `i + 1`**

To make it clearer, let's assume `i` at the end of the last iteration was `i_prev`. Then the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i_prev + 1`, and `mak` is `i_prev` if the input string is `'<'`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**

Since we do not have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize it as:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is `i + 1`**

But to be precise with the variable names as per the loop:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1**

Since we need to reflect the exact state right before the next iteration starts, we can denote it as:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is `i + 1`**

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
