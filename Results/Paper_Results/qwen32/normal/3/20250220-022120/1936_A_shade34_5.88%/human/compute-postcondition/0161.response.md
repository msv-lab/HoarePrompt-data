Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is at least 1.
2. `n` is greater than `len(pans) + 1`.
3. `mak2` is 0.
4. `i` is `len(pans) + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

From the initial state, we can see that:
- `mak2` is explicitly given as 0.
- `i` is explicitly given as `len(pans) + 1`.

However, there is no mention of a variable `mak` in the initial state. This suggests that there might be a typo in the print statement and it should be `mak2` instead of `mak`. Since the variable `mak` is not defined, we'll assume it's a typo and proceed with `mak2`.

### Analysis:
- The first argument in the `print` statement is a literal string `'?'`.
- The second and third arguments are `mak` (which we assume is `mak2`), and `mak2` is explicitly given as 0.
- The fourth and fifth arguments are `i`, and `i` is explicitly given as `len(pans) + 1`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the value of `mak2` twice, and the value of `i` twice.

Given that `mak2` is 0 and `i` is `len(pans) + 1`, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 len(pans) + 1 len(pans) + 1**
