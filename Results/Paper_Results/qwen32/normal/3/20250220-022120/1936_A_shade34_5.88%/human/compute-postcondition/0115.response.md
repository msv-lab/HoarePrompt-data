Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is `n-1` if the current value of `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` existed, `mak2` is the same as `mak`, `i` is `n-1`, and `pans` is `[n-1]` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, or `[n-1, n-1]` if `s` is not `'<'` and `pans` was not modified to `[n-1]` in the if part. `s` is the input string.**
