The code snippet `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given that `i` is `n-1`, `pans` will now contain this value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` existed, `mak2` is the same as `mak`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the value `n-1`, `s` is the input string, `s` is not equal to `'<'`, and `s` is equal to `'='`.**
