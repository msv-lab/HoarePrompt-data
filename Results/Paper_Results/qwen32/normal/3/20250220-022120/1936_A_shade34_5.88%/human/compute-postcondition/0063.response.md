The code snippet `mak = i` updates the value of `mak` to be equal to the current value of `i`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is equal to `n`. Therefore, `mak` will now hold the value of `n`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `pans`) remain unchanged by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `mak` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to the previous value of `mak`, and `pans` is a list of indices `i` for which the input was '=', with the last index `i` for which the input was '<' as the first element if any such index exists, and `pans` must have at least 3 elements.**
