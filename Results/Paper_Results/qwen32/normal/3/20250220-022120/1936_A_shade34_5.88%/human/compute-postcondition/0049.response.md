The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to `n`, so `pans` will have `n` appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<', `i` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the new input string, `pans` is `[n, n]` if the new `s` was '<', `[n-1, n, n]` if the new `s` was '=', or `[n-1, n]` if the new `s` was neither '=' nor '<' and was not previously '<'.**
