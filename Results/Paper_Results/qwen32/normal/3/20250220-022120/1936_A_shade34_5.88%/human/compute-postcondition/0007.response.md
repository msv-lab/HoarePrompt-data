The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its specific value. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `mak` are affected. The value of `mak` is updated to the value of `i`, while `t` and `n` retain their initial conditions. The input received is not used in the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `mak` is `i`**.
