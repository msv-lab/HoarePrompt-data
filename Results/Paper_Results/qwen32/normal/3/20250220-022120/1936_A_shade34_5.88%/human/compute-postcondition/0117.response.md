Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `t` is at least 1, but its exact value is not specified.
- `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
- `mak` is `n-1` if the current value of `s` is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` existed.
- `mak2` is the same as `mak`.
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `pans` is `[n-1]` if `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, or `[n-1, n-1]` if `s` is not `'<'` and `pans` was not modified to `[n-1]` in the if part.
- `s` is the input string, but its exact value is not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Let's break down the values of the variables based on the initial state:

1. **`mak` and `mak2`**:
   - If `s` is `'<'`, then `mak` is `n-1` and `mak2` is also `n-1`.
   - If `s` is not `'<'`, then `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` existed, and `mak2` is the same as `mak`.

2. **`i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly defined as `n-2`.

3. **`s`**:
   - The value of `s` is not specified, so we need to consider both cases (`s` being `'<'` or not `'<'`).

Given these points, we can describe the output in two scenarios:

### Scenario 1: `s` is `'<'`
- `mak` is `n-1`
- `mak2` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n-2`
- The print statement will output: `? n-1 n-1 n-2 n-1`

### Scenario 2: `s` is not `'<'`
- `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` existed.
- `mak2` is the same as `mak`.
- `i` is `n-2`
- The print statement will output: `? mak mak n-2 mak` (where `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` existed).

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we must account for both scenarios. However, the most precise description based on the given information is:

Output: **? mak mak n-2 mak (where mak is n-1 if s is '<', otherwise the highest value of i for which the input was '<' or 0 if no such i existed)**
