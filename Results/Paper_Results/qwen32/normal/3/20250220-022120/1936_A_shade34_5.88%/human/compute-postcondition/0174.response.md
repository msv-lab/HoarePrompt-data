Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `i` is n-1, `mak` is n-1, `pans` is a list containing the single element `i`, `s` is the input string and it is equal to '<'**

In natural language: The variable `pans`, which was initially an empty list, now contains a single element, which is the value of `i` (which is `n-1`). All other variables retain their initial values.
