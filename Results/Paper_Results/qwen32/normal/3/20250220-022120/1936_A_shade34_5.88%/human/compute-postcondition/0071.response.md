Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output of the print statement.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is at least 1.
2. `n` is greater than or equal to `i`.
3. `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` that caused the input to be '>', or 0 if no such element was found.
4. `mak2` is 0.
5. `i` is `len(pans) - 1`.
6. `pans` is unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('!', mak2, mak)
```

### Analysis:
- `mak2` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` that caused the input to be '>', or 0 if no such element was found. Since the exact content of `pans` is not provided, we can only describe its value conditionally based on the given information.

### Output:
The print statement will output the string `'!'`, followed by the value of `mak2`, and then the value of `mak`.

Given that `mak2` is 0, and `mak` can be any index in `pans` that caused the input to be '>', or 0 if no such element exists, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **! 0 mak (where mak is the index of the last element in pans that caused the input to be '>', or 0 if no such element was found)**
