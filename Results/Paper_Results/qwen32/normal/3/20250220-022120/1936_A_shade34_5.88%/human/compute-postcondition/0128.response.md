To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and how the variables are used in the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is at least 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it is provided for context).
- `n` is the integer value of the input.
- `mak` is initialized to 0.
- `mak2` is the same as `mak`, so `mak2` is also 0.
- `i` is initialized to `n`.
- `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `pans[mak]` will access the element at index `mak` in the list `pans`. Since `mak` is 0, this will be the first element of `pans`.
- `pans[mak]` is repeated, so the second element printed will also be the first element of `pans`.
- `pans[i]` will access the element at index `i` in the list `pans`. Since `i` is `n`, this will be the element at index `n` in the list `pans`. Note that `n` is the integer value of the input, so this element is the one at the position `n` in the list `pans`.

### Output:
The output will consist of:
- The literal string `'?'`.
- The first element of `pans` (repeated twice).
- The element at index `n` of `pans`.

Given the initial state, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[n]] [pans[n]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the list pans and pans[n] is the element at index n of the list pans)**
