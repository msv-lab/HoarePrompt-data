Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is the same as `mak`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is `[n-1]` if the current value of `s` is `'<'` or `s` is `'='`, otherwise `pans` is an empty list, and `s` is the input string.**

Explanation: The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to `i`. Since `i` is `n-1`, `mak` now also holds the value `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
