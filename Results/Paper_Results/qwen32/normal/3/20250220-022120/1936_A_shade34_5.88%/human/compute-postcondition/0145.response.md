The provided code snippet consists of a single statement `sys.stdout.flush()`. This statement flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the console. It does not modify any variables or affect the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `i`, or `mak`.

Thus, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `mak2` is 0, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, and `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` that resulted in the input `'>'`, or 0 if no such element exists.**
