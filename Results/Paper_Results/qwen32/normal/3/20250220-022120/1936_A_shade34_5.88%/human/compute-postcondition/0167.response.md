The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `pans`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `i`, or `mak`. The only change is the creation of the new list `pans`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the new input minus 1, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was <, `i` is n-1, `mak` is the largest i for which the input was <, `pans` is an empty list.**
