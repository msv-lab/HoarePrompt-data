The code snippet `pans.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-2`. Therefore, after executing the code, `pans` will include `i` as an additional element.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `i` is `n-2`, `mak` is `n-1` if `s` is `'<'` otherwise `mak` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `i` and potentially `n-1` depending on the initial value of `s`, and `s` is the new input string.**

In simpler terms, `pans` now includes `i` (which is `n-2`) along with any other elements it already had based on the initial conditions.
