Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `t` is at least 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it is part of the initial state).
- `n` is the integer value of the input and must be greater than 2 (though `n` is not used in the print statement, it is part of the initial state).
- `mak` is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise `mak` remains 0.
- `mak2` is 0 (though `mak2` is not used in the print statement, it is part of the initial state).
- `i` is 2.
- `pans` is unchanged (though `pans` is not used in the print statement, it is part of the initial state).

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak` is either 1 or 0 depending on the input. Since the input is not specified, `mak` could be either value.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.

Thus, the output will be:
- The first value is the literal string `'?'`.
- The second and third values are both `mak`, which is either 1 or 0.
- The fourth and fifth values are both `i`, which is 2.

Given this information, the output will be:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where [mak] is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise 0)**
