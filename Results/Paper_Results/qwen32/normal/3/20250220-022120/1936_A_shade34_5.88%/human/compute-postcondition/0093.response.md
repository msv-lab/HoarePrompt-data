The value of `mak2` is updated to be equal to the value of `mak`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mak`, `i`, and `pans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or `0` if no such `i` existed, `mak2` is the same as `mak`, `i` is `n-1`, and `pans` is unchanged.
