The code snippet `pans = [i]` assigns a new list containing the value of `i` to the variable `pans`. The previous contents of `pans` are replaced by this new list. The values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak` remain unchanged. The new value of `pans` is a list with a single element, which is the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak2` is the largest i for which the input was `<`, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `pans` is `[i]`, `s` is the new input string.**
