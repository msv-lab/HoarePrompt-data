The given code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the internal buffer of the standard output. This operation does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `mak2`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `len(pans)`, `mak2` is 0, `i` is `len(pans)`**.
