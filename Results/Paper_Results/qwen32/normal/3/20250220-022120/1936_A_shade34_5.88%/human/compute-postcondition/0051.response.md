Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the largest `i` for which the input was '<', `i` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `s` is the new input string. If `s` was '<', `pans` is `[n]`. If `s` was '=', `pans` is `[n-1, n, n]`. Otherwise, `pans` is `[n-1, n]` if the new `s` was neither '=' nor '<' and was not previously '<'.**
