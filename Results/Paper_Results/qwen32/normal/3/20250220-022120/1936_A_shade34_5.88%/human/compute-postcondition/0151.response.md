The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak2` is 0, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `mak` is 0**.
