Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` or 0 if no such `i` existed, `mak2` is the same as `mak`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the value `n-1` if `s` is equal to `'='`, otherwise `pans` is an empty list, and `s` is the input string which is not equal to `'<'`.**
