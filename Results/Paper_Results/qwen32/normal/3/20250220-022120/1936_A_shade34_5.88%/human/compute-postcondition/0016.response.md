The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer for the standard output. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'<'`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and `i` is `i + 2`.**
