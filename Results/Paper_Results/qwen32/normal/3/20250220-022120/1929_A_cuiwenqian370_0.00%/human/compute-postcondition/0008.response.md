The code snippet appends the element at the `right` index of `arr` to `new_arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, the element at `right` is the largest element in `arr`. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `new_arr` is a list containing the largest element of `arr`; `left` is 0; `right` is `n - 1`; `left` is not equal to `right`**.
