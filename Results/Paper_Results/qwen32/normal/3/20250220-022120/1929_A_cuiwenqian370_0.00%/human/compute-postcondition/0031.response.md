The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given that `left` and `right` are not part of the loop head, they should not be adjusted here. However, `max_beauty` is updated within the loop, but since it's not part of the loop head, it also should not be adjusted here.

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` should be 2 (since it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration and it gets incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration).
- `n` remains the same because it's the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`new_arr` is a list of `n` integers where elements are arranged in the order of largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, and so on, starting with the largest element; `left` is `n`; `right` is `n - 1`; `max_beauty` is updated to `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])`; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 2**
