Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. `left` is incremented by 1. If `left` was equal to `right` before the increment, `new_arr` includes the element `arr[left - 1]` (which is the same as `arr[right]`) appended to it. Otherwise, `new_arr` includes the elements `arr[previous left]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[current left]`. `right` is decremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `right` is decreased by 1. All other variables (`n`, `arr`, `left`, and `new_arr`) remain as described in the initial state, with the specific operations on `left` and `new_arr` still pending their execution as per the given conditions.
