### Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The function `func_1` sorts the array and then rearranges it in a specific order: starting with the largest element, followed by the smallest, then the second largest, the second smallest, and so on. This rearrangement is intended to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Let's analyze the correctness of the approach:

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array helps to easily access the largest and smallest elements.
2. **Rearranging the Array**: By placing the largest and smallest elements alternately, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is because the difference between the largest and smallest elements is the largest possible difference.
3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

Let's consider the example given in the problem:

- **First Test Case**: Input `2 1 3`. After sorting, the array is `1 2 3`. The rearranged array is `3 1 2`. The beauty is `(1-3) + (2-1) = -2 + 1 = 1` (absolute values are taken, so `|3-1| + |2-1| = 2`).
- **Second Test Case**: Input `69 69 69`. After sorting, the array is `69 69 69`. The rearranged array is `69 69 69`. The beauty is `0`.
- **Third Test Case**: Input `100 54 80 43 90`. After sorting, the array is `43 54 80 90 100`. The rearranged array is `100 43 90 54 80`. The beauty is `|43-100| + |90-43| + |54-90| + |80-54| = 57`.
- **Fourth Test Case**: Input `3 4 3 3`. After sorting, the array is `3 3 3 4`. The rearranged array is `4 3 3 3`. The beauty is `|3-4| + |3-3| + |3-3| = 1`.
- **Fifth Test Case**: Input `2 1`. After sorting, the array is `1 2`. The rearranged array is `2 1`. The beauty is `|1-2| = 1`.

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by rearranging it in the desired order and then calculating the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
