You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, where each integer in `arr` is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive. It returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a new list `new_arr` that is constructed by arranging the elements of `arr` in a specific order: starting with the largest element, then the smallest, followed by the second largest, second smallest, and so on.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze if the approach used by the program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

### Program Analysis:
The program takes the following steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
3. It calls the function `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty.
4. Inside `func_1`, the array is sorted.
5. The sorted array is then rearranged in an alternating order of the largest and smallest remaining elements.
6. The beauty of the rearranged array is computed by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
7. The result for each test case is printed.

### Verification:
Let's verify if the approach in `func_1` is correct:

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array is a good initial step as it allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Rearranging the Array**: By alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements, we maximize the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the difference between a large number and a small number is maximized when they are placed next to each other.
3. **Computing the Beauty**: The beauty is computed correctly by summing the absolute differences of the rearranged array.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the first example from the problem statement:
- Input: `3, 2 1 3`
- Sorted array: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Rearranged array: `[1, 3, 2]` (or `[3, 1, 2]`, both yield the same beauty)
- Beauty: \(|3-1| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3\) (or \(|1-3| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\))

However, the example output is `2`, which suggests that the optimal rearrangement might actually be `[1, 2, 3]` or `[3, 2, 1]`:
- Rearranged array: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Beauty: \(|2-1| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\)

This confirms that the rearrangement strategy used in `func_1` is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array by alternating between the largest and smallest elements after sorting. Therefore, the program is correct.
