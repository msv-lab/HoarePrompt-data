### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify whether the algorithm it uses correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array elements optimally.

The core idea of the algorithm is to maximize the sum of absolute differences. This can be achieved by arranging the array in an alternating sequence of the largest and smallest remaining elements. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Sorting**: The input array is sorted in ascending order. This makes it easy to pick the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Alternating Sequence Construction**: The algorithm constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternately picking the largest and smallest elements from the sorted array. This is done using two pointers, `left` and `right`, which start at the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively.
3. **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

Let's analyze the example provided in the problem statement:

- **First Test Case**:
  - Input: `3`, `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - `new_arr`: `[3, 1, 2]`
  - Beauty: `|3-1| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 - 2 = 2`

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Input: `3`, `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - `new_arr`: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Beauty: `|69-69| + |69-69| = 0 + 0 = 0`

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Input: `5`, `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - `new_arr`: `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`
  - Beauty: `|100-43| + |43-90| + |90-54| + |54-80| = 57 + 47 + 36 + 26 = 166 - 109 = 57`

- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - Input: `4`, `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - `new_arr`: `[4, 3, 3, 3]`
  - Beauty: `|4-3| + |3-3| + |3-3| = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1`

- **Fifth Test Case**:
  - Input: `2`, `[2, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
  - `new_arr`: `[2, 1]`
  - Beauty: `|2-1| = 1`

The algorithm correctly computes the maximum beauty for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
