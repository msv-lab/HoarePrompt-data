Reasoning:

The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The provided program attempts to achieve this by sorting the array and then rearranging it in a specific pattern: it alternates between the largest and smallest remaining elements.

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Sorting**: The array is sorted in ascending order.
2. **Rearranging**: The program creates a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array. This is done using two pointers, `left` and `right`, which start at the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively.
3. **Calculating Beauty**: After rearranging, the program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array.

The strategy of alternating between the largest and smallest elements is correct because it maximizes the differences between consecutive elements, leading to a higher total beauty.

Let's verify the program with the given examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `1 2 3`
   - Rearranged: `3 1 2`
   - Beauty: `(3-1) + (2-1) = 2 + 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `69 69 69`
   - Rearranged: `69 69 69`
   - Beauty: `(69-69) + (69-69) = 0 + 0 = 0`

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `43 54 80 90 100`
   - Rearranged: `100 43 90 54 80`
   - Beauty: `(100-43) + (90-43) + (54-43) + (80-54) = 57 + 47 + 11 + 26 = 57`

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `3 3 3 4`
   - Rearranged: `4 3 3 3`
   - Beauty: `(4-3) + (3-3) + (3-3) = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1`

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `2 1`
   - Sorted: `1 2`
   - Rearranged: `2 1`
   - Beauty: `(2-1) = 1`

The program produces the correct results for all the given examples, indicating that the logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
