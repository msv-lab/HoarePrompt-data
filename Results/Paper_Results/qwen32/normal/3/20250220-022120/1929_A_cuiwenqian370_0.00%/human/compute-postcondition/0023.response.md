Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `left` is less than `right - 1`; `new_arr` includes the elements `arr[left]` and `arr[right]`; `left` is incremented by 1; `right` is decremented by 1.

```
new_arr.append(arr[left])
```

After the execution of `new_arr.append(arr[left])`, the element at index `left` of `arr` is appended to `new_arr`. Therefore, `new_arr` now includes the elements `arr[left]` (from the previous state), `arr[right]` (from the previous state), and `arr[left]` (from the current state).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `left` is less than `right - 1`; `new_arr` includes the elements `arr[left]` (previous `left`), `arr[right]`, and `arr[left]` (current `left`)**.
