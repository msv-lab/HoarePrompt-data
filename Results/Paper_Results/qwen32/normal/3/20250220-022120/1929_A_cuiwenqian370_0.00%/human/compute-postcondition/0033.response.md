The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper bound of the loop.

State: **`new_arr` is a list of `n` integers where elements are arranged in the order of largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, and so on, starting with the largest element; `left` is `n`; `right` is `n - 1`; `max_beauty` is updated to `max_beauty + abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1]) + abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])`; `n` must be greater than 1; `i` is 3**
