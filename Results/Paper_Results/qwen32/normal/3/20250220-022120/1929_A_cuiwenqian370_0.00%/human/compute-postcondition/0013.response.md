The `while` loop condition is `left <= right`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `left` is less than or equal to `right`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- If `left` equals `right`, `new_arr` is a list containing the last element of `arr`, i.e., `new_arr` is `[arr[n-1]]`, and both `left` and `right` are equal to `n - 2`.
- Otherwise, `new_arr` is a list containing the largest element of `arr` and the first element of `arr`, `left` is 1, and `right` is `n - 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `left` and `right` such that `left <= right`.

If `left` equals `right` at the end of the previous iteration, setting `left` to `right - 1` would ensure `left <= right` for the next iteration, assuming `right` is at least 1.

If `left` is not equal to `right`, the loop can already execute again unless `right` is less than `left`. However, based on the initial conditions given (`left` is 1 and `right` is `n - 2`), `right` is always greater than `left` unless `n` is 2. If `n` is 2, `left` and `right` are both 0, and the loop will not execute again.

Given the conditions, we need to ensure that `left` is less than or equal to `right`. Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `left` and `right` after the previous iteration, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where `left` might be equal to `right`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we can adjust `left` to be `right - 1` if `left` equals `right`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `left` equals `right`, set `left` to `right - 1`. Otherwise, no adjustment is needed as `left` is already less than `right`.**
