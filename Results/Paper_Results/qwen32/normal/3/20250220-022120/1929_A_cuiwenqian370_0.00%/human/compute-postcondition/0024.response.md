Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. `left` is incremented by 1 and `right` is decremented by 1. If `left` was equal to `right` before the increment and decrement, `new_arr` includes the element `arr[left]` (which is the same as `arr[right]`) appended to it. Otherwise, `new_arr` includes the elements `arr[previous left]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[current left]`.**
