Let's break down the given information and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\).
- Either `m` is not less than `a` or `m` is not less than `b` (or both).
- The current value of `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`.

### Key Points:
- The condition `m < a` and `m > b` implies that `b < m < a`.
- The print statement is `print(2 + m // b)`.

### Analysis:
- The expression `m // b` is the integer division of `m` by `b`, which means it computes the largest integer `k` such that \(k \times b \leq m\).
- Given that `b < m < a`, `m // b` will always be at least 1 because `m` is strictly greater than `b`.
- The final output of the print statement will be `2 + (m // b)`.

### Output:
The code prints the value of `2 + (m // b)`, where `m // b` is the integer division of `m` by `b` and `b < m < a`.

Output: **2 + (m // b) (where m // b is the integer division of m by b, and b < m < a)**
