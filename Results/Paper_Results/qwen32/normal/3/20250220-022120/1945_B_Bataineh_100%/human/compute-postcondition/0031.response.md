Postcondition: **`a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `m` ≤ 10^18. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `m < a and m < b`. If `m` is greater than `a` and less than `b`, then `a < m < b`. Otherwise, either `m` is not less than `a` or `m` is not less than `b` (or both). `i` is incremented by 1 in all cases.**
