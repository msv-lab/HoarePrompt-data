The `print(2)` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `m`. The integer `2` is directly printed to the console.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the input variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` but does not affect the execution of the `print(2)` statement.
2. The `print(2)` statement explicitly outputs the integer `2`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
