The print statement in the code snippet is `print(2)`. This statement will output the integer `2` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `m`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

The initial state describes the conditions and relationships between `a`, `b`, and `m`, but it does not affect the output of the `print(2)` statement. The value `2` is explicitly specified in the print statement and will be printed as is.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2**
