The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. Prior to this, `t` was an input integer with a specific value, and `a`, `b`, and `m` were integers with specific values. After the code executes, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the values read from the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18.**
