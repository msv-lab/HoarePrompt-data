The loop iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. For each `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`. If it is, `i` is appended to `output1` and `x // i` is appended to `output2`. This process continues until all possible divisors up to the square root of `x` have been checked.

After all iterations, `output1` will contain all the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` will contain the corresponding divisors greater than or equal to the square root of `x` (i.e., `x // i` for each `i` in `output1`).

Output State: **`output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` contains the corresponding divisors greater than or equal to the square root of `x`.**

In simpler terms, `output1` and `output2` together will list all the divisors of `x` in pairs where each pair multiplies to `x`.
