Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Incomplete Function Implementation**: The function `func_1` is used in the code but it is not defined within the provided code snippet. This makes the code incomplete and non-functional.

2. **Logic Errors**: The logic used in the code to determine the possible values of `k` is incorrect. The code attempts to use the function `func_1` to find divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`, but it does not correctly implement the logic to find valid `k` values based on the problem description.

3. **Output Handling**: The code does not print the output for each test case. It calculates the possible values of `k` but does not store or print them.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `x` is 1, the code might not correctly identify all possible `k` values.

Here is a corrected version of the program that should meet the problem description:

```python
def count_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):  # k must be greater than 1
        period = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_period = (n - 1) % period
        if position_in_period < k:
            if position_in_period + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if 2 * k - 2 - position_in_period == x:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_k(n, x))
```

Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The function `count_k` iterates over all possible values of `k` from 2 to `n`.
- For each `k`, it calculates the period length as `2 * k - 2`.
- It then determines Vasya's position within this period.
- If Vasya's position corresponds to the number `x` as per the problem description, it increments the count.
- Finally, it prints the count for each test case.

This corrected program should handle all edge cases and provide the correct output as per the problem description.
