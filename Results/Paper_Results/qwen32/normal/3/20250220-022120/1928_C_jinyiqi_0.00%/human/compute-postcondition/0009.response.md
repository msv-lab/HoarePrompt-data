The code appends the integer division of `x` by `i` to the list `output2`. The values of `x`, `n`, and `output1` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is also not changed by this operation, as it is only used in the calculation and not reassigned.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `output1` has a new element appended, which is the current value of `i`; `output2` has a new element appended, which is the integer value of `x / i`.**
