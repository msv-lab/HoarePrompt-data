The loop in the given code is defined as:

```python
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one integer. This means that the upper bound of the range (`int(x ** 0.5) + 1`) must be greater than the lower bound (which is 1).

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 1. This implies `int(x ** 0.5)` must be at least 1, which in turn means `x ** 0.5` must be at least 1. Therefore, `x` must be at least 1. Given the initial condition `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, `x` already satisfies this requirement.

Thus, no adjustments are needed for `x` or `n` to ensure the loop executes. The initial state already guarantees that the loop will execute at least once.

The state remains as:
State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is an empty list; `output2` is an empty list**
