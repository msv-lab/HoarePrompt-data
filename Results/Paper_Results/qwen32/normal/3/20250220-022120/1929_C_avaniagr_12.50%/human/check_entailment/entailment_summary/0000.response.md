Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

Sasha's goal is to determine if he can guarantee that he can reach any number of coins `n` given the rules of the casino. The key points are:
- Sasha can bet any positive integer `y` coins.
- If he wins, he receives `y * (k - 1)` more coins.
- If he loses, he loses `y` coins.
- He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.

### Strategy:
The problem revolves around whether Sasha can recover from a series of losses and continue to increase his coins. The strategy needs to ensure that Sasha can always recover from losing `x` consecutive bets and still reach any target number of coins.

### Conditions for "YES":
1. **If `x < k - 1`:**
   - Sasha should be able to recover from `x` losses and still have enough coins to make further bets.
   - The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha can afford the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row, starting with bets of 1 coin, 2 coins, ..., up to `x` coins.

2. **If `x == k - 1`:**
   - The logic becomes more complex due to the balance between losing `x` times and the multiplier `k`.
   - The condition `a >= x + 3` is used here to ensure Sasha can recover and continue betting.

3. **If `x > k - 1`:**
   - Sasha has a significant buffer against consecutive losses.
   - The program calculates a threshold `z` by simulating the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row, starting with bets of 1 coin, 2 coins, ..., up to `x` coins, and checks if `a` is at least `z`.

### Program Analysis:
The program correctly implements the logic described above:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `k`, `x`, and `a`.
- It then checks the conditions based on the value of `x` relative to `k - 1` and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
- The calculation of `z` in the case of `x > k - 1` correctly simulates the worst-case scenario and checks if `a` meets the threshold.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can guarantee reaching any number of coins `n` given the constraints of the problem.

**Correctness:** **True**
