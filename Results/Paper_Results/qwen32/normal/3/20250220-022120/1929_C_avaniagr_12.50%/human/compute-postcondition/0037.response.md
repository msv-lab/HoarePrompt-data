Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input and split into their respective variables.
- The conditions for `a` are based on the value of `x` relative to `k - 1`:
  - If `x < k - 1`, then `a` can be either \(\geq x + 1\) or \(< x + 1\).
  - If `x = k - 1`, then `a` can be either \(\geq x + 3\) or \(< x + 3\).
  - If `x > k - 1`, `z` is calculated by iterating the formula \( z = z + \left(\frac{z}{k - 1}\right) + 1 \) for `x + 1` times, and `a` can be either \(\geq z\) or \(< z\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement will execute and print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or the calculations involving `z`. The conditions provided in the initial state do not affect the execution of the `print` statement itself, as it simply outputs a fixed string.

### Conclusion:
The output of the code snippet will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
