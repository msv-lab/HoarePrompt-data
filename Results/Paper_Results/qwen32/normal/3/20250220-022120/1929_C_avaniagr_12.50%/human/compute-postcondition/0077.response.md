Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 1` or less than `x + 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 3` or less than `x + 3`. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `z` is calculated by iterating the formula \( z = z + \left(\frac{z}{k - 1}\right) + 1 \) for `x + 1` times, and `a` is either greater than or equal to the final value of `z` or less than the final value of `z`. The program does not change the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `z` based on the given conditions. If `x` equals `k - 1`, `a >= x + 3` or `a < x + 3`. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is calculated as `x + 1` if `k > 2` or `2^(x+1) - 1` if `k = 2`, and `a >= z` or `a < z`.**
