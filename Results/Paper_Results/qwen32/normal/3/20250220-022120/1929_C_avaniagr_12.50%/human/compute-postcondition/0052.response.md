Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with `x` being at least 0; `z` is the value calculated after `x + 1` iterations using the formula `z = z + (z // (k - 1)) + 1`; `i` is `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then no further changes are made to `a`, `z`, `k`, `x`, `t`, or `i`. If `a` is less than `z`, then no further changes are made to `a`, `z`, `k`, `x`, `t`, or `i`.**

In simpler terms: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers with `x` being non-negative, and `z` is calculated after `x + 1` iterations. The value of `i` is `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, no changes occur. If `a` is less than `z`, no changes occur.**
