The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not affect the loop's execution, the only variable we need to consider is `t`.

The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Given the problem statement, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, which means the loop will always execute at least once with the provided constraints. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000**
