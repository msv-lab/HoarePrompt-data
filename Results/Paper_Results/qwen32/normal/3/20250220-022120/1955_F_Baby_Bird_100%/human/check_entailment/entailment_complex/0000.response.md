To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to understand the problem statement and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem involves determining the maximum number of times Bob can win in a game where Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers in a sequence is non-zero. Eve removes one number at a time from the sequence, and Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if for each bit position, the number of 1s is even. The numbers in the sequence can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, which have the following binary representations:
- 1: `01`
- 2: `10`
- 3: `11`
- 4: `00`

The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if:
- The count of numbers with the least significant bit set (1 and 3) is even.
- The count of numbers with the second least significant bit set (2 and 3) is even.

### Strategy to Maximize Bob's Wins:
To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to remove numbers such that the remaining sequence has an even count of 1s and 3s, and an even count of 2s and 3s.

### Calculation:
For each test case with counts of 1s (`p1`), 2s (`p2`), 3s (`p3`), and 4s (`p4`):
- The count of 1s and 3s should be even. The optimal way to achieve this is to remove numbers such that the count of 1s and 3s is minimized to be even.
- The count of 2s and 3s should be even. Similarly, the optimal way to achieve this is to remove numbers such that the count of 2s and 3s is minimized to be even.

The formula used in the program:
```python
sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))
```
This formula works as follows:
- For each count `x` of numbers (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s):
  - `x // 2` represents the number of pairs of numbers, which can be removed to make the count even.
  - `x % 2` represents the remainder when `x` is divided by 2. If `x % 2` is 1, and the number is either 1, 2, or 3 (`i < 3`), it contributes to making the count even.
- The sum of these contributions is then divided by 3 to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Correctness of the Program:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by optimally removing numbers to make the counts of 1s and 3s, and 2s and 3s even.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
