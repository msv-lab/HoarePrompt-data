You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers p1, p2, p3, and p4 (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The function will receive multiple test cases, with the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided initially.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: The result for each test case, where the result is the integer division of the calculated sum by 3, with each result on a new line



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step according to the problem description and the examples given. The program is supposed to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice in a game involving a sequence of integers where each integer is between 1 and 4. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero after Eve removes some numbers optimally.

Here is the provided program:
```python
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
```

### Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads `t` (number of test cases) and then for each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence.
2. **Logic**: The main logic is in the sum expression:
   ```python
   sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3
   ```
   - `x // 2` counts how many pairs of each number there are. Each pair of identical numbers will result in a zero when XORed.
   - `x % 2` checks if there is an odd number of a particular number.
   - `(i < 3)` ensures that the logic for odd counts is applied only for 1s, 2s, and 3s (not for 4s). This is because 4 XOR 4 is 0, and 4 itself does not affect the XOR result in the same way as 1, 2, and 3.
   - The sum of these values for each type of number is then divided by 3 to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3))`
   - Simplifies to: `(0 + 1) + (0 + 1) + (0 + 1) + (0 + 0) = 3`
   - Result: `3 // 3 = 1`
   - This matches the expected output.

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (1 // 2) + 1 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (3 < 3))`
   - Simplifies to: `(0 + 1) + (0 + 0) + (0 + 1) + (3 + 0) = 5`
   - Result: `5 // 3 = 1`
   - This matches the expected output.

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3))`
   - Simplifies to: `(3 + 0) + (3 + 0) + (3 + 0) + (0 + 0) = 9`
   - Result: `9 // 3 = 3`
   - This matches the expected output.

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (3 < 3))`
   - Simplifies to: `(4 + 1) + (4 + 1) + (3 + 0) + (0 + 0) = 13`
   - Result: `13 // 3 = 4`
   - However, the expected output is `3`, which suggests a potential issue.

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation: `(3 * (0 // 2) + 0 % 2 * (0 < 3)) + (3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (1 < 3)) + (3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (2 < 3)) + (3 * (9 // 2) + 9 % 2 * (3 < 3))`
   - Simplifies to: `(0 + 0) + (13 + 1) + (13 + 1) + (13 + 0) = 41`
   - Result: `41 // 3 = 13`
   - This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program seems to work correctly for the provided examples except for the fourth example where the expected output is `3` and the program outputs `4`. This discrepancy suggests that there might be an issue with the logic, particularly in how the counts of numbers are being handled.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases as demonstrated by the fourth example where the expected output is `3` but the program outputs `4`. This indicates that there is a flaw in the logic for determining the maximum number of times Bob can win.
