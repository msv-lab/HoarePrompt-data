The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200). These integers represent the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence, respectively. The number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is provided initially. For each test case, the function calculates and returns the sum of the sequence based on the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours, and return the sum of the sequence for each test case.
