You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers p1, p2, p3, and p4 (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The function will receive multiple test cases, with the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided initially.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: The result for each test case, where the result is the integer division of the calculated sum by 3, with each result on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours, and returns the sum of the sequence for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
