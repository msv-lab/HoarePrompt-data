The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. Since the initial state specifies that `a`, `b`, and `m` are already integers, the `map(int, input().split())` function will update these variables with the new values provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers provided by the input.**

In simpler terms, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to whatever integers are provided by the input, while `t` retains its value of being greater than 0.
