Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The logic in the program is incorrect because it simply adds up the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m` and then adds 2, which is not the correct way to determine the maximum overlap.

Let's consider an example to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

### Example:
For the input:
```
1
6 7 4
```
The program calculates the output as:
```
m // a + m // b + 2 = 4 // 6 + 4 // 7 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2
```

However, the correct calculation should account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. In this case, the fireworks launched by the first installation at times [0, 6] and the fireworks launched by the second installation at times [0, 7] would both be visible at time 0. Additionally, the fireworks launched by the first installation at time 6 and the fireworks launched by the second installation at time 7 would both be visible at time 6 and 7. Therefore, the correct answer should be 2, which matches the program's output in this particular case, but it is not a general solution.

### Another Example:
For the input:
```
1
3 4 10
```
The program calculates the output as:
```
m // a + m // b + 2 = 10 // 3 + 10 // 4 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7
```

However, the correct answer should be 7 because the fireworks launched by the first installation at times [0, 3, 6, 9] and the fireworks launched by the second installation at times [0, 4, 8] overlap in such a way that the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is indeed 7.

### Another Example:
For the input:
```
1
7 8 56
```
The program calculates the output as:
```
m // a + m // b + 2 = 56 // 7 + 56 // 8 + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17
```

However, the correct answer should be 17, which matches the program's output in this particular case, but again, it is not a general solution.

### Another Example:
For the input:
```
1
5 6 78123459896
```
The program calculates the output as:
```
m // a + m // b + 2 = 78123459896 // 5 + 78123459896 // 6 + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630
```

However, the correct answer should be 28645268630, which matches the program's output in this particular case, but again, it is not a general solution.

The program does not correctly handle the overlap of fireworks from both installations, and it does not account for the correct maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
