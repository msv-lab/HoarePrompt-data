Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is flawed because it simply adds the number of fireworks that each installation can launch within the visibility period `m` and then adds 2, which does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of overlapping fireworks and then calculating the number of fireworks from both installations within a given period, taking into account the overlaps.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        # Number of fireworks from installation 1 within m+1 minutes
        fireworks_a = (m + 1) // a
        # Number of fireworks from installation 2 within m+1 minutes
        fireworks_b = (m + 1) // b
        # Number of overlapping fireworks within m+1 minutes
        fireworks_overlap = (m + 1) // lcm_ab
        # Total number of fireworks visible at the same time
        total_fireworks = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - fireworks_overlap
        print(total_fireworks)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the number of fireworks from each installation and subtracts the overlaps to get the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
