Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. However, the logic implemented in the provided function is incorrect.

The function calculates `m // a + m // b + 2` for each test case, which does not accurately determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. The formula does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations and the visibility duration `m`.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of overlapping launch times. The number of fireworks visible at any time `t` can be calculated by considering the number of fireworks launched by each installation up to `t` and adjusting for overlaps.

The correct approach involves iterating over a range of possible times to find the maximum overlap of fireworks. However, a more efficient method involves using mathematical insights to calculate the maximum overlap directly.

Given the complexity of the correct solution, the provided function does not implement the correct logic, and therefore, it will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
