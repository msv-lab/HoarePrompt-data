You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Example

Input

    6 7 4
    
    3 4 10
    
    7 8 56
    
    5 6 78123459896
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 1000000000000000000

Output

    2
    7
    17
    28645268630
    4
    2000000000000000002
    
Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has read three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, calculated the value `m // a + m // b + 2`, and printed this value. The variable `i` will be equal to `t` after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The logic in the program is incorrect because it simply adds up the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m` and then adds 2, which is not the correct way to determine the maximum overlap.

Let's consider an example to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

### Example:
For the input:
```
1
6 7 4
```
The program calculates the output as:
```
m // a + m // b + 2 = 4 // 6 + 4 // 7 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2
```

However, the correct calculation should account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. In this case, the fireworks launched by the first installation at times [0, 6] and the fireworks launched by the second installation at times [0, 7] would both be visible at time 0. Additionally, the fireworks launched by the first installation at time 6 and the fireworks launched by the second installation at time 7 would both be visible at time 6 and 7. Therefore, the correct answer should be 2, which matches the program's output in this particular case, but it is not a general solution.

### Another Example:
For the input:
```
1
3 4 10
```
The program calculates the output as:
```
m // a + m // b + 2 = 10 // 3 + 10 // 4 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7
```

However, the correct answer should be 7 because the fireworks launched by the first installation at times [0, 3, 6, 9] and the fireworks launched by the second installation at times [0, 4, 8] overlap in such a way that the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is indeed 7.

### Another Example:
For the input:
```
1
7 8 56
```
The program calculates the output as:
```
m // a + m // b + 2 = 56 // 7 + 56 // 8 + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17
```

However, the correct answer should be 17, which matches the program's output in this particular case, but again, it is not a general solution.

### Another Example:
For the input:
```
1
5 6 78123459896
```
The program calculates the output as:
```
m // a + m // b + 2 = 78123459896 // 5 + 78123459896 // 6 + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630
```

However, the correct answer should be 28645268630, which matches the program's output in this particular case, but again, it is not a general solution.

The program does not correctly handle the overlap of fireworks from both installations, and it does not account for the correct maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
