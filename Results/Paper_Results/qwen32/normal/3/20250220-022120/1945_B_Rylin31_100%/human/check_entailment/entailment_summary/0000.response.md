Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Let's analyze why this is the case.

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. This involves considering the periodic launch times of fireworks from both installations and their visibility duration. The program, however, simply computes `m // a + m // b + 2` for each test case, which does not account for the overlap of visibility periods between fireworks from the two installations.

Here's a breakdown of what the program does:
- `m // a` gives the number of fireworks from the first installation that are visible within the first `m` minutes.
- `m // b` gives the number of fireworks from the second installation that are visible within the first `m` minutes.
- Adding `2` is not explained and does not logically contribute to the correct solution.

The correct approach involves:
1. Finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity when both installations launch fireworks.
2. Considering the overlap of visibility periods of fireworks from both installations over the LCM period.

Given the incorrect logic, the program will not produce the correct results for most test cases.

Correctness: **False**
