The code `nodes[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list associated with the key `v` in the `nodes` dictionary. This means that `nodes[v]` will now include `u` in addition to any other values it already contains. The values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes[u]`, `u`, `v`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list where `nodes[u]` includes `v` and `nodes[v]` includes `u`, `u` is the first integer provided as new input, `v` is the second integer provided as new input, `i` is 1, `nodes[v]` includes `u`.**
