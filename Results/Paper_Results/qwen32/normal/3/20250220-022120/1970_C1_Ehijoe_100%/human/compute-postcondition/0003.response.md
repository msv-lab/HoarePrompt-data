The code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` named `nodes` with a default factory of `list`. This means that if a key is accessed that does not exist in the dictionary, it will automatically create a new entry with an empty list as its value. The variables `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `empty` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list.**
