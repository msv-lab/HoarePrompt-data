The code snippet `tree.append(curr)` adds the current value of `curr` to the `tree` list. Given that `curr` is initially set to `s`, the value of `s` will be appended to the `tree` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of list and `nodes[s]` contains `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `ends` is a list containing all the leaf nodes of the tree, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the value of `s` twice, `prev` is the first element of `ends`, `curr` is `s`**.

This means that the `tree` list now contains the value of `s` twice, while all other variables retain their previous values.
