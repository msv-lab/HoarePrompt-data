The code snippet `ends.append(key)` appends the value of `key` to the list `ends`. Since `ends` was previously an empty list or a list containing `key` if `len(nodes[key])` is 1, after this operation, `ends` will definitely include `key`.

The other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes`, `i`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and must contain at least one key, `i` is `n-1`, `ends` is a list containing `key`, `key` is the next key in `nodes` after the previously processed key.**
