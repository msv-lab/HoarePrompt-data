The code snippet provided is simply an assignment statement that updates the value of `prev` to the current value of `curr`. No other variables are affected by this statement. Therefore, the only change in the state is the value of `prev`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is the integer provided as input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is `True`; `nodes` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of list and `nodes[s]` contains `s` and possibly another element; `i` is `n-1`; `ends` is a list containing all the leaf nodes of the tree; `s` is the first element of `ends`; `e` is the second element of `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the value of `s` twice, `curr`, and now `curr` is appended again; `prev` is `curr`. If `nodes[curr][0]` equals `prev`, then `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][1]`. Otherwise, `curr` remains `s`. `curr` must not be equal to `e`.**
