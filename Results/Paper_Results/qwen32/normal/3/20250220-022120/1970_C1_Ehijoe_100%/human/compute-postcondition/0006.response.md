The code appends the value of `v` to the list associated with the key `u` in the `defaultdict` `nodes`. This means that the list stored at `nodes[u]` will now include `v` as an additional element. The values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list where `nodes[u]` now includes `v`, `u` is the first integer provided as input, `v` is the second integer provided as input.**
