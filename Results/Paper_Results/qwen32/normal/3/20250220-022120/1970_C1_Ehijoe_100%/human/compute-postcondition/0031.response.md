The code snippet assigns the value of `s` to a new variable `prev`. This does not change the values of any existing variables other than introducing `prev` with the same value as `s`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5
- `t` is the integer provided as input
- `edges` is an empty list
- `empty` is `True`
- `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list
- `i` is `n-1`
- `ends` is a list containing all the leaf nodes of the tree
- `s` is the first element of `ends`
- `e` is the second element of `ends`
- `tree` is a list containing the value of `s`

The only change is the introduction of `prev` with the value of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list, `i` is `n-1`, `ends` is a list containing all the leaf nodes of the tree, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the value of `s`, `prev` is the first element of `ends`**.
