The code snippet provided is simply `prev = curr`. This means the value of `prev` is updated to the current value of `curr`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `prev` is initially set to `nodes[s][1]`. After executing `prev = curr`, `prev` will now hold the value of `curr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is the integer provided as input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is `True`; `nodes` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of list and `nodes[s]` contains `s` and possibly another element; `i` is `n-1`; `ends` is a list containing all the leaf nodes of the tree; `s` is the first element of `ends`; `e` is the second element of `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the value of `s` twice, `curr`, and now `curr` is appended again; `prev` is `curr`. If `nodes[curr][0]` equals `prev`, then `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][1]`. Otherwise, `curr` remains `s`. `curr` must not be equal to `e`.**
