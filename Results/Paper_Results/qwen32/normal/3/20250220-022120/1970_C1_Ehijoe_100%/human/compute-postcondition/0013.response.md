The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. This means the values of `u` and `v` will be updated based on the new input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list where `nodes[u]` includes `v` and `nodes[v]` includes `u`, `u` and `v` are the integers provided as new input, `i` is 2**.
