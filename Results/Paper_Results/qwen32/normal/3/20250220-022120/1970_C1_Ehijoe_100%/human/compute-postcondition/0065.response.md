Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is the integer provided as input, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of list, `i` is `n-1`, `ends` is a list containing all the leaf nodes of the tree, `s` is the first element of `ends`, `e` is the second element of `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the path from `s` to `e` with an additional `e` at the end, `prev` is `e`, `curr` is `e`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is `[idx, n - idx - 1]`. At least one of the values in `moves` is odd if the if condition is met; otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even.**
