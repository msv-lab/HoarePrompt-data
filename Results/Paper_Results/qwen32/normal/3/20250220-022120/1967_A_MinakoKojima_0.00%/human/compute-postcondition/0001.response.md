The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state only specifies that `t` (the number of test cases) must be greater than 0. This precondition remains unchanged. 

After the code execution, `n` and `k` will hold the integer values that were inputted, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.**
