You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively. Additionally, each test case contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12), where a_i represents the number of cards of type i initially available. The total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) is given at the start of the input, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        m = min(a)
        
        ans = 0
        
        if k >= n * m:
            ans = math.factorial(n)
        else:
            k -= n * m
            for i in range(n):
                a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
                k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            ans = a[0]
            for i in range(1, n):
                ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: All test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the value of `ans` has been computed and printed. The variable `t` is 0, indicating no more test cases remain to be processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of distinct types of cards, an integer `k` representing the number of coins, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` represents the number of cards of type `i` initially available. The function returns the result for each test case based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
