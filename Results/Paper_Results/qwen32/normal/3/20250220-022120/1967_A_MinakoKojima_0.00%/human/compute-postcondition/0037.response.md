Given the code snippet:
```
a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
```

The value of `a[i]` is updated based on the expression `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`. The values of `m`, `k`, `n`, and `a[i]` before this operation are unknown, but we know `n` must be greater than 0.

The output state will reflect the new value of `a[i]` after the operation, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`**.
