The code snippet provided initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are modified or used in the snippet. Therefore, the only change in the state is the introduction of `ans` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) must be greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0.**
