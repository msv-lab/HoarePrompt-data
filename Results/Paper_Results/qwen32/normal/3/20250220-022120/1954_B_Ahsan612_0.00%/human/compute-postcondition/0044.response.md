The value of `num` is updated to be the first element of the list `ar`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `minn`, and `same`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input, `i` is the length of the new `ar`, `num` is the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` retains its previous value, and `same` is 1.**
