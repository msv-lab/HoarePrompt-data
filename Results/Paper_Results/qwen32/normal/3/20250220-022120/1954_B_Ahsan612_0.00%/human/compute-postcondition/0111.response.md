Postcondition: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 4. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 3, `num` remains the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 4. Otherwise, `i` is either 4 or 5, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or `ar[3]`, `minn` is either 1 or 2, and `same` is either 2 or 1.**
