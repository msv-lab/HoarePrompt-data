Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements. If `ar[i] == num`, then `i` is 2, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `i` is 3, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is 1, and `same` is 1.**
