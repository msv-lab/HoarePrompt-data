The code updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (`inf`) and the value of `same` (which is 2). Since `2` is less than `inf`, `minn` will be updated to `2`.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 1, `i` is 3, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is 2, and `same` is 2.**
