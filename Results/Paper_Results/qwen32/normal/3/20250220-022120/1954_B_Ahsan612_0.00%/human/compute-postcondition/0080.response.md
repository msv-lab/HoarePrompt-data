The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which does not correspond to any variable in the provided state. This loop is iterating based on the input integer `t`, and the loop variable `_` does not affect or depend on the variables in the given state. However, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` must be decremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `t`.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

Since `t` should be decremented for the loop to execute one more time, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

Simplifying the description of `t`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

Since `t` is decremented, we can represent it as `t-1`:

State: **`t` is `t-1` such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

So the final adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

Since `t` is decremented, we can represent it as:

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

So the final adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

Since `t` is decremented, the final state is:

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

So the final adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

The final state representation is:

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

Since `t` is decremented, the final state is:

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

So the final adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

The final state is:

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

The final adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

Since `t` is decremented, the final state is:

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.**

The final adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of
