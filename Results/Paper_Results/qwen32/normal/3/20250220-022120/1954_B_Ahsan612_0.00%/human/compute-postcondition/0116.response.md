The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a constant value `-1`. The initial state provides some context about the variables `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`, and `same`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is not influenced by these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `t` is defined as `t-1`, which doesn't provide a specific value but suggests that `t` is being decremented by 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a new list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is the length of the list `ar`.
   - `num` is the last unique element in the list `ar`.
   - `minn` is initialized to `inf` (infinity).
   - `same` is initialized to `1`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print(-1)` statement directly outputs the integer `-1` without referencing any of the variables defined in the initial state.

3. **Output:**
   - Since the `print` statement is outputting a constant value `-1`, the output will be `-1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`, and `same`.

Output: **-1**
