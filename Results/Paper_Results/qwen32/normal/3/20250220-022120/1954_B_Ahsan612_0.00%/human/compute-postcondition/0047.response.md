To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `i < len(ar)`. 

Here's the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a new list of integers from the input
- `i` is 1
- `num` is the first element of the new `ar`
- `minn` is `inf`
- `same` is 1

The loop condition `i < len(ar)` needs to be true for the loop to execute. Given that `i` is 1, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the length of the list `ar`. It must have more than one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `num` is the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 1**
