Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **`t` is `t-1`**:
   - This statement suggests that `t` is being updated to be one less than its previous value. However, since `t` is not explicitly defined or initialized before this statement, we cannot determine its exact value based on the given information. For the purpose of this problem, we can consider `t` as some integer value, but it is not necessary to determine the exact value to answer the question about `minn`.

2. **`n` is an input integer**:
   - `n` is an integer provided as input. Its exact value is not specified, but it is an integer.

3. **`ar` is a new list of integers from the input**:
   - `ar` is a list of integers that is provided as input. The exact elements of the list are not specified, but we know it is a list of integers.

4. **`i` is `len(ar)`**:
   - `i` is assigned the length of the list `ar`. So, `i` is an integer representing the number of elements in the list `ar`.

5. **`num` is the last unique element in `ar`**:
   - `num` is assigned the last unique element in the list `ar`. The exact value of `num` depends on the elements of `ar`, but it is the last unique element.

6. **`minn` is not equal to infinity (it is the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1)**:
   - `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and 1. This means that `minn` will be 1 if its previous value was greater than 1, or it will remain as its previous value if it was already 1 or less.

7. **`same` is 1**:
   - `same` is assigned the value 1. This variable is not used in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant for this task.

### Print Statement Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print(minn)
```

### Determining the Output:

From the initial state, we know that `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and 1. Given that `minn` is not explicitly stated to be greater than 1 initially, and considering the operation `min(minn, 1)`, `minn` will be 1 if it was greater than 1, or it will stay as its previous value if it was already 1 or less. However, the problem does not provide the initial value of `minn`, but it clearly states that `minn` is not equal to infinity and it is the result of `min(minn, 1)`. This implies that `minn` will be at most 1 after this operation.

Since the problem does not specify any initial value of `minn` that would make it less than 1, and given the operation `min(minn, 1)`, the most precise and safe assumption is that `minn` will be 1 after this operation.

### Final Output:

Output: **1**
