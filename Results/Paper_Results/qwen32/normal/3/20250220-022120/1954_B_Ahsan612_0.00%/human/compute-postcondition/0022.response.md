The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the variable `same`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 2 elements, `i` is 3, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is either 1 or 2, and `same` is 1.**
