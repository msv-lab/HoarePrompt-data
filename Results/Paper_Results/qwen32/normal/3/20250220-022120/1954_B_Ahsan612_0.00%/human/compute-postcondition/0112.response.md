The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was either 3, 4, or 5. If `i` was 3, it becomes 4. If `i` was 4, it becomes 5. If `i` was 5, it becomes 6. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 4. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 4, `num` remains the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 4. Otherwise, `i` is either 5 or 6, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or `ar[3]`, `minn` is either 1 or 2, and `same` is either 2 or 1.**
