Postcondition: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last unique element in `ar`, `minn` is either `inf` or the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1, `same` is 1. If `minn` was `inf`, it remains `inf`. Otherwise, `minn` is updated to the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1.**
