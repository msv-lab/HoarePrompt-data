To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the given loop and how the variables evolve over the iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Input**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- **Variables**:
  - `n`: Number of elements in the array for each test case.
  - `ar`: List of integers representing the array.
  - `same`: Counts the number of consecutive identical elements.
  - `num`: Tracks the current number being compared.
  - `minn`: Tracks the minimum count of consecutive identical elements found so far.
  - `i`: Index for iterating through the array.

### Iteration Process:
1. **Initialization**: For each test case:
   - `same` is initialized to 1.
   - `num` is set to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is set to `inf`.
   - `i` is set to 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates through the array, comparing each element with the previous one.
   - If the current element (`ar[i]`) is equal to `num`, `same` is incremented.
   - If the current element is different from `num`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `same`, `same` is reset to 1, and `num` is updated to the current element.
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time to ensure the last sequence of identical elements is considered.

3. **Output**:
   - If `minn` remains `inf` (which would only happen if the array is empty, which is not possible given the constraints), `-1` is printed.
   - Otherwise, the value of `minn` is printed.

### Final Output State:
After all `t` iterations, the loop will have processed each test case independently. The variables `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are specific to each test case and do not retain their values across different test cases. Therefore, after the loop completes all iterations, the final state of these variables is undefined for the context of the entire loop execution, as they are re-initialized for each test case.

However, the overall output of the program, which is the printed values for each test case, will be a series of integers representing the minimum count of consecutive identical elements for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The final output state, focusing on the printed values, is a series of integers corresponding to the minimum count of consecutive identical elements for each of the `t` test cases.

Output State: **The program prints the minimum count of consecutive identical elements for each of the `t` test cases.**
