The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 1, so now `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num` is the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 1. Additionally, `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
