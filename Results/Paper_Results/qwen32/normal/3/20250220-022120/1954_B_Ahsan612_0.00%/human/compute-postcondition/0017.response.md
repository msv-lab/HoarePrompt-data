The `while` loop in question is controlled by the condition `i < len(ar)`. The variables `i` and `ar` are the only ones that can be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements
- `i` is 2
- `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`
- `minn` is either `inf` or 1
- `same` is either 1 or 2

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` is currently 2, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 2. 

No other variables need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 1 or 2**
