The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was 3, so after the execution, `i` becomes 4. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 4, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 2 or 3**.
