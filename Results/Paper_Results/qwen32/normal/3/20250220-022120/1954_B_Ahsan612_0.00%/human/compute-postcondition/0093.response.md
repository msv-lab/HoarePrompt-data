The code snippet updates the value of `minn` by taking the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given that `minn` is initially `inf` (infinity) and `same` is 1, the result of this operation will be `minn` being set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, and `same` is 1. `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
