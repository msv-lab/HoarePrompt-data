The value of `num` is updated to `ar[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `num` is now the third element of the list `ar`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 1. Additionally, `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
