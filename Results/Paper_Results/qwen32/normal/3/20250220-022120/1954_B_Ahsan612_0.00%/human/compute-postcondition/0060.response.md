The code assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. Given `i` is 3, `num` will now hold the value of the fourth element in the list `ar`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 1 or 2.**
