Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` retains its value of `inf`, and `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same` if `minn` was not `inf`, otherwise `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last unique element in `ar`, `minn` is either `inf` or the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1, `same` is 1. If `minn` was `inf`, it remains `inf`. Otherwise, `minn` is updated to the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
