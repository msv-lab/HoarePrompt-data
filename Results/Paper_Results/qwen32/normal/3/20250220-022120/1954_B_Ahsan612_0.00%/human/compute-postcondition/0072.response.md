Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements. If `ar[i] == num`, then `i` remains 3, `num` remains either the first or second element of `ar`, `minn` remains either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `i` becomes 4, `num` becomes `ar[4]`, `minn` is the minimum of its initial value and `same`, and `same` becomes 1. `i` is now `i + 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `same`) remain unchanged unless their values were dependent on `i` being 3 or 4, in which case their values are updated according to the conditions provided.
