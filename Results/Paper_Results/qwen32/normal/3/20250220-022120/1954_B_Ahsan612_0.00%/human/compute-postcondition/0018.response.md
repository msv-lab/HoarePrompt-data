The value of `same` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `same` was initially 1, it will now be 2, and if `same` was initially 2, it will now be 3. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with more than 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, and `same` is either 2 or 3**.
