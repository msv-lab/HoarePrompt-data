Given the initial state, the value of `i` can be either 4 or 5, and `num` is updated based on the value of `i`. Let's break down the possible scenarios:

1. If `i` is 4, then `num` remains the first element of the new `ar`.
2. If `i` is 5, then `num` is updated to `ar[3]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `minn`, `same`) remain unchanged unless their values are explicitly modified in the code snippet provided. Here, only `num` is updated.

Thus, the output state will be:

- If `i` is 4, `num` remains the first element of `ar`.
- If `i` is 5, `num` becomes `ar[3]`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we must consider both possibilities.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 4, `i` is either 4 or 5, if `i` is 4 then `num` is the first element of `ar`, if `i` is 5 then `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is `inf` or 2, and `same` is 3 or 1.**
