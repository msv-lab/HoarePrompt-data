The code snippet `num = ar[i]` changes the value of `num` to the element at index `i` in the list `ar`. Given that `i` is 3, `num` will now hold the value of `ar[3]`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:
- `t` is still `t-1`.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `ar` is still a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 1.
- `i` remains 3.
- `num` is now `ar[3]`.
- `minn` is still `inf`.
- `same` remains 2.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input with a length greater than 1, `i` is 3, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 2.**
