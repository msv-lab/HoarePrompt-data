The `print(-1)` statement is a straightforward print statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`, and `same` are provided in the initial state, but they do not affect the output of this specific print statement. The print statement is independent of these variables and simply outputs `-1`.

Output: **-1**
