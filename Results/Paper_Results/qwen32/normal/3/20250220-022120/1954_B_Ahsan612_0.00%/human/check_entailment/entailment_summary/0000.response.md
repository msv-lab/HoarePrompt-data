### Reasoning:

The program's logic is to find the minimum length of a consecutive sequence of identical elements in the array for each test case. If the array is composed of a single element repeated throughout, the program correctly identifies this as `-1` because no single removal can make it non-beautiful.

However, the problem requires the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The given program does not correctly address this requirement. It only finds the shortest sequence of identical consecutive elements and does not consider how removing those elements would affect the array's beauty.

For example, in the case of the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the shortest sequence of identical consecutive elements is `[5]` with a length of `1`. However, removing just one element (the `5`) does not make the array non-beautiful because the remaining `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` is still beautiful. The correct answer should be `3` because removing any three `3`s would make the array non-beautiful.

The current program's logic does not account for the necessary removals to disrupt the ability to perform the specified operation to make all elements the same. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
