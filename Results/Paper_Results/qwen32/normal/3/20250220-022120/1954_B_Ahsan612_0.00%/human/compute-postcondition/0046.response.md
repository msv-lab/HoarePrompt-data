The value of `i` is explicitly set to 1 by the given code. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `same`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `num` is the first element of the new `ar`, `minn` is `inf`, and `same` is 1.**
