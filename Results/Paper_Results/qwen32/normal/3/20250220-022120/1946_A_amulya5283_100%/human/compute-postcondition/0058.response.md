The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of the variable `res` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `mdx`) are not affected by this operation. 

Given the initial state, the value of `res` is not explicitly mentioned, but we know that after this operation, `res` will be its previous value plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers input by the user, `i` is `i + 1`, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `res` is its previous value plus 1.**
