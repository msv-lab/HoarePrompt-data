To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `t > 0` is satisfied. The variable `t` is the only one mentioned in the loop head, so we can only adjust its value.

Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is already guaranteed that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
