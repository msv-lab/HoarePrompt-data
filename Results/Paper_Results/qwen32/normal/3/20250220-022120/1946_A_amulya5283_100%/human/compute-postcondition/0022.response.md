Let's break down the given information to understand what will be printed.

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
   - `n`: An integer input by the user, and it is not equal to 1.
   - `a`: A sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `mdx`: Calculated as \( n // 2 + n \% 2 - 1 \).
     - If `n` is odd, \( n \% 2 \) is 1, so `mdx` becomes \( n // 2 + 1 - 1 = n // 2 \). This is the middle index of the list.
     - If `n` is even, \( n \% 2 \) is 0, so `mdx` becomes \( n // 2 + 0 - 1 = n // 2 - 1 \). This is the index of the first of the two middle elements (since the list is 0-indexed).
   - `res`: The count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

2. **Understanding `mdx` and `res`:**
   - `mdx` identifies the middle element (or the first of the two middle elements if `n` is even) in the sorted list `a`.
   - `res` is the count of how many times the middle element (or the first of the two middle elements) appears in the list `a`.

3. **The print statement:**
   - The code snippet provided is `print(res)`.
   - This will print the value of `res`, which is the count of occurrences of the middle element (or the first of the two middle elements) in the sorted list `a`.

Given the initial state and the definitions, the output of the `print(res)` statement will be the count of how many times the middle element (or the first of the two middle elements in case of an even-length list) appears in the sorted list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the count of elements in the sorted list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]`)**
