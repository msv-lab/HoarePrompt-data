The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is at least 1
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- If `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer
- If `n` is not 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`
- If the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1 and `i` is `mdx + 1`

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `mdx + 1` (if `res` is 1) and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration), and `n` must be such that `i` is still less than `n`.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is at least `mdx + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `mdx + 2`**
