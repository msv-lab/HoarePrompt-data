The code snippet provided recalculates the value of `mdx` using the formula `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged. The new value of `mdx` is dependent on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, `a` is the sorted list of integers input by the user, if `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer. If `n` is not 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. `res` is 0, `mdx` is recalculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.**
