Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is defined as `t - 1` (though `t` is not used in the provided print statement, it's mentioned for completeness).
- `n` is the integer input by the user.
- `a` is the sorted list of integers input by the user.
- If `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer.
- If `n` is not 1, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` and `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(1)` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, or `res`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

### Output:
The code will print the integer `1` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **1**
