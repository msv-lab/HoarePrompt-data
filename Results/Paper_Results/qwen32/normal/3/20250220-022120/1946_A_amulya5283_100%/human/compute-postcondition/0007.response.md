In the given initial state, the variable `n` is set to 1, indicating that the list `a` contains exactly one integer. The variable `t` is defined to be an integer between 0 and 10,000, but it is not used in the `print` statement provided. The list `a` is sorted and contains one integer within the range 1 to 1,000,000,000.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(1)
```

This statement will print the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `n`, `t`, or the contents of the list `a`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **1**
