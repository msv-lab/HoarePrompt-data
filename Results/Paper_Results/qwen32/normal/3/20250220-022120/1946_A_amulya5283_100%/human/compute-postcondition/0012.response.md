Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user and is not equal to 1; `a` is the sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `res` is 0; `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`; the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`.**
