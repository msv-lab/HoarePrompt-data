The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mdx`, `n` must be at least 1, and `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user. If `n` is 1, `a` contains exactly one integer. If `n` is not 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. If the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0, `i` is `mdx + 1`**
