To determine what will be printed by the `print(cnt)` statement, we need to understand the variables and their relationships based on the given initial state.

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `t`: It is defined as `t - 1`. However, the initial value of `t` is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value.
   - `n`: This is an integer input by the user.
   - `a`: This is a list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user.
   - `b`: This is another list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user.
   - `cnt`: This variable holds the count of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`.
   - `i`: This variable counts the number of elements in `a` that have been compared and found to be less than or equal to elements in `b`, or it is set to `n` if all elements in `a` have been compared.
   - `j`: This variable is set to `n`.

2. **Focus on `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is specifically defined as the count of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`. This means we need to compare each element of `a` with the corresponding element in `b` and count how many times the element in `b` is less than the element in `a`.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(cnt)` statement will output the value of `cnt`, which is the count of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`.

Given the information, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cnt` without knowing the specific values of `a` and `b`. However, we can describe the value of `cnt` based on the given conditions.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the count of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`)**
