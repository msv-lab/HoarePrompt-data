Postcondition: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). If `b[j] < a[i]`, then `cnt` is `cnt + 1`. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1. In both cases, `j` is `j + 1`.**
