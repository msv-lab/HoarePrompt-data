Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of problems, a list `a` of length `n` representing the difficulties of the proposed problems, and a list `b` of length `n` representing the expected difficulties of the problems. The function should handle up to 100 test cases. It returns a comparison result indicating whether the proposed difficulties match the expected difficulties for each test case.**
