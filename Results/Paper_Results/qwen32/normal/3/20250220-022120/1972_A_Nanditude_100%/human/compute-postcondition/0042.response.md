Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new integer input by the user (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of length `n` consisting of integers input by the user (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9), `j` is incremented by 1. If `b[j] < a[i]`, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.**
