Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the input. Additionally, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]` and `clues[0]` is not equal to 1. The condition that either both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even or both are odd is false, meaning one is even and the other is odd.**
