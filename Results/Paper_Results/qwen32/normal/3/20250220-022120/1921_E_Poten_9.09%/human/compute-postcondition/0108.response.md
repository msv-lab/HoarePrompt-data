Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is incremented by 1, and `answers` is a list that has been updated based on the conditions provided. Specifically, if `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` includes the string `'Draw'`. Otherwise, `answers` includes the string `'Alice'`.**
