Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers derived from the input, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd, `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1. Additionally, it is not the case that (clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. The variable `test_cases` still equals `t` and is greater than 0. The `answers` list now contains the string 'Bob'. The `clues` list retains its original values and properties, including the conditions on `clues[2]`, `clues[4]`, `clues[0]`, `clues[3]`, and `clues[5]` as specified.
