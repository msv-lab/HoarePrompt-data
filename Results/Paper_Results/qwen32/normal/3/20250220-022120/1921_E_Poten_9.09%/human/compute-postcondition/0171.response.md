Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` representing the dimensions of a rectangle and the coordinates of two distinct points within the rectangle. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given coordinates, ensuring that the sum of `h` across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
