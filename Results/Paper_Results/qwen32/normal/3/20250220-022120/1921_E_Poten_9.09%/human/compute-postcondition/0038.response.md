Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or the string 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers derived from the input, `clues[2]` is less than or equal to `clues[4]`, `clues[0]` is not equal to 1, `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are either both even or both odd, `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1 or less. If `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string 'Bob'.**
