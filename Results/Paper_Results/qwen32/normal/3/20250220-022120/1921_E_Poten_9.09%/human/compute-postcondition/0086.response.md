Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `answers` is a list that has been updated based on the conditions provided and now includes 'Bob', `i` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the only change is that the string 'Bob' has been appended to the `answers` list. All other variables retain their previous states and values.
