To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the nature of the loop and how it processes the `answers` list. The loop iterates over each element in the `answers` list and prints it. Therefore, after all iterations, all elements of the `answers` list will have been printed.

Given the initial state and the outputs after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to execute until all elements in the `answers` list have been processed. The output state after all iterations will simply be the state where all elements of the `answers` list have been printed.

Since the loop prints each element of the `answers` list and there are no modifications to the list or other variables within the loop, the final state of the `answers` list remains unchanged. The only change is that all elements have been printed.

Output State: **`answers` is a list containing the result for each of the `t` test cases, where each result is either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', and all elements of `answers` have been printed.**
