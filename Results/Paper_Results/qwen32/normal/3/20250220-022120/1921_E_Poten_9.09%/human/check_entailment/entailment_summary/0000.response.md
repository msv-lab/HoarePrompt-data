### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board between Alice and Bob, based on their initial positions and the rules given. The program's logic is based on a series of conditions that consider the positions of Alice and Bob, and the dimensions of the board.

However, the program's logic appears to be flawed in several aspects. Here are some key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Draw Conditions:**
   - The program incorrectly handles situations where the game should end in a draw. For instance, if Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row, the game should end in a draw. The program does not correctly account for all scenarios where no player can make a move.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Winning Conditions:**
   - The program's logic for determining who wins is overly complex and includes several incorrect conditions. For example, the program checks the parity (even or odd) of the rows of Alice and Bob's positions to determine the winner, which is not a correct approach based on the problem description.

3. **Simplification of the Problem:**
   - The problem can be simplified by considering the relative positions of Alice and Bob and the board boundaries. The correct approach involves checking if either player can force a win or if the game will inevitably end in a draw due to the board boundaries or the inability of either player to make a move that results in a win.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game for all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
