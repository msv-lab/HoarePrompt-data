Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`, and `answers` contains either `'Draw'` or `'Alice'` based on the condition `clues[5] - 1 - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`. If the condition is true, `answers` contains `'Draw'`; otherwise, `answers` contains `'Alice'`.**
