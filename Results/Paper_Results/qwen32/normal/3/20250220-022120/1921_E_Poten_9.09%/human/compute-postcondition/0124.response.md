Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw'**.

In natural language: The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000, `test_cases` remains equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` remains a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, and `answers` now contains the string 'Draw'.
