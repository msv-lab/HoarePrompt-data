In the given task, the for loop iterates over the elements in the `answers` list. The loop variable `j` takes on the value of each element in `answers` during each iteration. 

To ensure that the loop executes, the `answers` list must contain at least one element. The state of `j` is determined by the elements in `answers`, so we do not need to explicitly define `j` before the loop starts. The loop will automatically assign `j` to the first element of `answers` during the first iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the `answers` list to ensure it contains at least one element.

State: **`answers` is a list containing the result for each of the `t` test cases, where each result is either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', and `answers` must have at least 1 element**
