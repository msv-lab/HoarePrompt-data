The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `answers` list. If there are more elements in the `answers` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the last element of the `answers` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `answers` must have at least one more element.

State: **`answers` is a list containing the result for each of the `t` test cases, where each result is either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', and `answers` must have at least 2 elements**
