Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`, and `answers` includes either `'Draw'` if `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise `answers` includes `'Alice'`.**
