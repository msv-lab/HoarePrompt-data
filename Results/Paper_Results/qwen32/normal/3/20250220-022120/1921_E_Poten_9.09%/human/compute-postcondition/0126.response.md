The code snippet appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same for these variables except for `answers`, which now contains the additional string `'Draw'`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`, `answers` contains the string `'Draw'`**
