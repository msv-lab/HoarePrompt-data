The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `clues`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `answers` is a list that has been updated with the string `'Draw'`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
