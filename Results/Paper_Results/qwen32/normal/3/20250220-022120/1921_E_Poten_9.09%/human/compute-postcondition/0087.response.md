Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is incremented by 1. If `clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` is updated with an additional element `'Draw'`. Otherwise, `answers` is updated with an additional element `'Bob'`.**
