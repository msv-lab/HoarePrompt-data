Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is equal to `t` and is greater than 0, `clues` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`. If `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, the `answers` list has a new element `'Draw'` appended to it. Otherwise, the `answers` list contains the string `'Alice'`.**
