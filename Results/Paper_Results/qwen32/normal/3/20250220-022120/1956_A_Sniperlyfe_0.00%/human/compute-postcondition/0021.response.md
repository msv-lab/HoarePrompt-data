The only variable in the loop head is `n`, and it is being iterated over the list `qs`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, the list `qs` must contain at least one integer. The value of `n` before the loop starts (which is described as "the last integer in the newly input `qs`") does not directly affect whether the loop will execute; rather, it is the length of `qs` that matters.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is the last integer in the newly input `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 1, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer**
