The code snippet appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Given the initial state, `res` already has an additional element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`. After executing the code, `res` will have one more element appended to it, making it two elements longer than its initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the next integer in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers, `k` is the first integer read from the input, `q` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one more integer, `res` has two additional elements which are the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**
