To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, we need to analyze the provided initial state and understand the variables and their relationships.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `n` is the next integer in the list `qs` after the current `n`.
- `p` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `k` and `q` are two integers read from the input.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers.
- `res` contains the result of `func_1(n_last, p)`, `func_1(n, p)` appended to it, and now also contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended again.

### Analysis:
- The `res` list is built by appending results of the `func_1` function. Specifically, `res` contains:
  1. The result of `func_1(n_last, p)`
  2. The result of `func_1(n, p)`
  3. The result of `func_1(n, p)` (appended again)

Therefore, `res` will have the following structure:
\[ \text{res} = [ \text{func_1}(n\_last, p), \text{func_1}(n, p), \text{func_1}(n, p) ] \]

### Print Statement:
The print statement `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` will convert each element of the `res` list to a string and join them with a space.

### Output:
The output will be a space-separated string of the three results from `func_1`:
\[ \text{Output: func_1(n\_last, p) func_1(n, p) func_1(n, p)} \]

Since the exact values of `n_last`, `n`, `p`, and the function `func_1` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the function results.

### Final Answer:
Output: **func_1(n_last, p) func_1(n, p) func_1(n, p) (where func_1 is a function that takes two arguments)**
