The code snippet `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `qs`. 

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `p`, `k`, `q`, and `t` are unchanged. The new variable `qs` is introduced and assigned the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of players initially in the game, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `k` is the first integer read from the input, `q` is the second integer read from the input, and `t` must be greater than 0; `qs` is a list of integers read from the input.**
