The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Given that `res` initially contains two elements, after the append operation, `res` will contain three elements, all of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 integers, `n` is the third integer in the list `qs`, `p` is a new list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is a list containing three elements, all of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.
