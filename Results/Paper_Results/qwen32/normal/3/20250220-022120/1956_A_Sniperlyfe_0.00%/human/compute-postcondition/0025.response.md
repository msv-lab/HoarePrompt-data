The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The values of `n`, `p`, `k`, `q`, `t`, and `qs` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `t` is greater than 1 and `qs` has at least 2 integers still holds. The only change is that `res` now includes an additional element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output State: **`n` is the next integer in the list `qs` after `n_last`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 1, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `res` contains the result of `func_1(n_last, p)` and `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**
