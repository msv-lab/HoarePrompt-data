Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Output Handling**: In `func_2`, the `print` statement is incorrectly placed inside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`. This means that after processing the first `n`, it will print the result for that `n` and then continue processing the remaining `n` values, leading to incorrect output formatting. The correct approach is to collect all results for a test case and print them together after processing all `n` values for that test case.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` is generally correct for simulating the game rounds, but there is a subtle issue with the while loop condition and the way the number of players is reduced. The condition `while n >= min(p)` is fine, but the way the sum is calculated and subtracted might not be optimal for all cases. However, this part seems to work as intended based on the problem description. The main issue is with the output handling as mentioned above.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
# Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

In the corrected version, the `print` statement is moved outside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs` for a given test case, ensuring that the results for all `n` values are printed on a single line, as required by the problem description.
