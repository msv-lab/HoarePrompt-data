The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only state we need to adjust is `t`.

Given that `t` is greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`n` is the last integer in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers, `k` is the first integer read from the input, `q` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is greater than 0, `qs` is a list of integers, `res` has the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended for each element in `qs`, `t` is decremented by 1**.

Since `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that after decrementing, `t` is still greater than 0. Therefore, the correct state should reflect that `t` has been decremented but is still positive.

State: **`n` is the last integer in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers, `k` is the first integer read from the input, `q` is the second integer read from the input, `t` is greater than 1, `qs` is a list of integers, `res` has the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended for each element in `qs`**.
