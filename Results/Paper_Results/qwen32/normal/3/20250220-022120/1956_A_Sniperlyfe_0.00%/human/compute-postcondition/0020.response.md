The given code snippet resets the list `res` to an empty list. This affects the variable `res` directly by clearing its contents, but it does not change the values of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `k`, `q`, `t`, `qs`).

Output State: **`n` is the last integer in the newly input `qs`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `k` and `q` are the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 1, `qs` is the newly input list of integers, `res` is an empty list.**
