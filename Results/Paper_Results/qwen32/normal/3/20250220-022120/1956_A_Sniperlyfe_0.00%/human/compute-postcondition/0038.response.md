To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `qs` is a new list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 integer.
2. `n` is the first integer in the list `qs`.
3. `p` is a new list of integers read from the input.
4. `k` and `q` are the two new integers read from the input.
5. `t` is greater than 0.
6. `res` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Analysis:
- The `res` list contains one element, which is the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
- The `print` statement uses `map(str, res)` to convert each element of the `res` list to a string.
- `' '.join(...)` then joins these string elements with a space in between.

### Output:
Since `res` is a list containing one element, the `map(str, res)` will convert that single element to a string. The `' '.join(...)` will simply return that string because there is only one element.

Given that `res` contains one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, the output will be that result converted to a string.

### Final Output:
Output: **[result of func_1(n, p)] (where [result of func_1(n, p)] is the single element in the res list converted to a string)**
