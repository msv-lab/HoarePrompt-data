The code snippet `k, q = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `k` and `q` respectively. This means the previous values of `k` and `q` are overwritten by the new values read from the input.

The other variables (`n`, `p`, `t`, `qs`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the last integer in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers, `k` and `q` are the two integers read from the input, `t` is greater than 1, `qs` is a list of integers, `res` has the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended for each element in `qs`.**
