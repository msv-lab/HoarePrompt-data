Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (where `1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18`), representing the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, and the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky. For each test case, the function returns the result of some computation or comparison based on these values.**
