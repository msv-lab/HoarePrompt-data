Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program simply calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the first `m + 1` minutes and sums them up. However, it does not account for the overlap in visibility times of fireworks from both installations.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6 7 4
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times: 6, 12, 18, 24, ...
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times: 7, 14, 21, 28, ...
- Within the first 5 minutes (0 to 4), no fireworks are visible.
- At time 6, a firework from the first installation is launched and visible from 6 to 10.
- At time 7, a firework from the second installation is launched and visible from 7 to 11.
- At time 12, another firework from the first installation is launched and visible from 12 to 16.
- At time 14, another firework from the second installation is launched and visible from 14 to 18.
- At any given time, a maximum of 2 fireworks are visible simultaneously.

The program, however, calculates:
- A = int(4 / 6) + 1 = 1
- B = int(4 / 7) + 1 = 1
- Output = A + B = 2

While the output is correct for this specific case, it is not because the program correctly handles overlaps. For other cases, the program will not account for overlaps correctly and will likely produce incorrect results.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and calculate the number of overlapping intervals within the first `m + 1` minutes. This is a more complex calculation that the current program does not perform.
