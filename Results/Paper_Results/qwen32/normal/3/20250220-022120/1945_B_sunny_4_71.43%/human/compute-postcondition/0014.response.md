The value of `B` is recalculated as `int(m / b) + 1`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `A` is also unchanged as it is calculated based on the initial values of `m` and `a`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `a`, `b`, and `m` are the new integers provided by the input; `A` is `int(m / a) + 1`; `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`.**
