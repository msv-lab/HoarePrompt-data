To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(0, x):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `p`, and `l` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The only requirement is that `x` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i` for all `i` in [1, `n`], and all `p_i` are distinct; `x` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 0**
