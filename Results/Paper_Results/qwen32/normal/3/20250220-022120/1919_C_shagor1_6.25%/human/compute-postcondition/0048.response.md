The code snippet `y = a` changes the value of `y` to the value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `a`, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, and `a` is greater than `x` and greater than `y`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `y` is now equal to `a`, while `x`, `ans`, `n`, `inp`, and the condition that `a` is greater than both `x` and `y` remain the same.
