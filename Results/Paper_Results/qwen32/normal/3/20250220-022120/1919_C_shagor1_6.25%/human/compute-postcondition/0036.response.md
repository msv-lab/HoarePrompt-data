The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This does not affect the variables `x`, `y`, or `ans` which are already defined in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the smallest element in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in `inp`, `ans` is the number of times an element was greater than both `x` and `y`, `n` is an input integer.**
