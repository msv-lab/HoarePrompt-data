The provided code snippet `x == y` is a comparison operation that checks if `x` is equal to `y`. However, `x` and `y` are not defined in the initial state, and this comparison does not affect any of the variables `n`, `inp`, or `ans`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `inp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), `inp` is a tuple of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is 0**
