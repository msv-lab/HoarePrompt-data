Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), `inp` is a tuple of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is 0. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is set to `a` and `y` remains `n + 1`. Otherwise, `x` remains `n + 1`, `y` is set to `a`, and `ans` is set to 1 if `a` is greater than `x`.**
