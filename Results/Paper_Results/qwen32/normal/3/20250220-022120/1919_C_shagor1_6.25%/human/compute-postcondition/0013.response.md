Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), `inp` is a tuple of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `a`, `ans` is 0, and `a` is greater than `y`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `y` has been updated to the value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
