To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the values of `x`, `y`, and `ans` based on the initial state provided.

1. **x**: This variable is defined as the smallest element in the list `inp`.
2. **y**: This variable is defined as the second smallest element in the list `inp`.
3. **ans**: This variable counts the number of times an element in the list `inp` is greater than both `x` and `y`.

Since we don't have the specific list `inp`, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `x`, `y`, and `ans`. However, we can describe `ans` in terms of the conditions given.

The variable `ans` is incremented each time an element in `inp` is greater than both `x` and `y`. Therefore, `ans` represents the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than the two smallest elements in the list.

Given this understanding, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be the value of `ans`, which is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest elements.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest elements in `inp`)**
