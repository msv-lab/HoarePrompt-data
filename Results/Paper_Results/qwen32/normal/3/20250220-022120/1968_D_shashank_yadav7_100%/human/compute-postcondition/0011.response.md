The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on these variables. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The current state already mentions that `i` is 0, which is appropriate for the start of the loop. The value of `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers read from the input with `b` decremented by 1, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is decremented by 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`**
