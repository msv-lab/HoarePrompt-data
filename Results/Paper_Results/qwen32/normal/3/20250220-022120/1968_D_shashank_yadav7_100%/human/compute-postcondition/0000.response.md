Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each testcase, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` are integers such that 1 <= `P_B`, `P_S` <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^9. `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The sum of all `n` values across all testcases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

In natural language: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input by the user, which is between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`) and their conditions remain unchanged.
