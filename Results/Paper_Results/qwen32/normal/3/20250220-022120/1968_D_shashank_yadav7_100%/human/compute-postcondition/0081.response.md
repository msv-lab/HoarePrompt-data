The code snippet `sp += a[s]` adds the value of `a[s]` to `sp`. Given that `sp` is initially `a[s] + a[s]` (which is `2 * a[s]`), after executing the code, `sp` will be `2 * a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[s]`.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `bp`, `sm`, `bm`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `k` is an input integer minus 2; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `3 * a[s]`; `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`; `sm` is the maximum of `(a[s] - 1) * (k + 1)` and `a[s] * k + (a[s] - 1)` and `a[s] * k + 2 * a[s]`; `bm` is the maximum of `max(a[b] * (k + 1), a[b] * k + bp - a[b])` and `a[b] * k + bp`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input. If `k` is equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
