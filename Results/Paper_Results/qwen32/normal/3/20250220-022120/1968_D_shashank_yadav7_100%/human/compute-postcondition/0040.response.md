The code snippet provided increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. Therefore, the new value of `sp` is the previous value of `sp` plus `a[s]`.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 2
- `k` is an integer that has been decremented by 3 from its initial value
- `b` is `p[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1`
- `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`
- `p` is a list of integers read from the input
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `sp` is `3 * a[s]`
- `bp` is `3 * a[b]`
- `bm` is `max(max(a[b] * k, a[b] * k + bp), a[b] * k + bp)`
- `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * (k + 3))`

After executing the code `sp += a[s]`, the value of `sp` is now `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `4 * a[s]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `k` is an integer that has been decremented by 3 from its initial value; `b` is `p[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1`; `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `4 * a[s]`; `bp` is `3 * a[b]`; `bm` is `max(max(a[b] * k, a[b] * k + bp), a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * (k + 3))`.**
