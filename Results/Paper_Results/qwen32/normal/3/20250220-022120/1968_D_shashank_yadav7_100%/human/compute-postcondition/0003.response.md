The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `p`. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged by this code snippet. The Output State will reflect the new list `p` along with the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers read from the input, `p` is a list of integers read from the input.**
