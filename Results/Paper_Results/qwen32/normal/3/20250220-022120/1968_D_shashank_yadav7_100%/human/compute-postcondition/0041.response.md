The code snippet provided is `bp += a[b]`. This means that the value of `bp` is incremented by the value of `a[b]`. 

Given the initial state, `bp` is initially `3 * a[b]`. After the execution of the code, `bp` will be `3 * a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `4 * a[b]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `k` is an integer that has been decremented by 3 from its initial value; `b` is `p[p[p[b] - 1] - 1] - 1`; `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `sp` is `4 * a[s]`; `bp` is `4 * a[b]`; `bm` is `max(max(a[b] * k, a[b] * k + bp), a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * (k + 3))`.**
