You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each testcase, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. p is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive. a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The sum of all n values across all testcases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        
        s -= 1
        
        sp = a[s]
        
        bp = a[b]
        
        bm = a[b] * k
        
        sm = a[s] * k
        
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `i` is `min(n, k) - 1`; `n` is unchanged; `k` is 0 if `k` was greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `k - min(n, k)`; `b` is `p[p[...p[b]...]] - 1` (updated `min(n, k)` times); `s` is `p[p[...p[s]...]] - 1` (updated `min(n, k)` times); `p` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged; `sp` is the cumulative sum of `a[s]` for `min(n, k)` iterations; `bp` is the cumulative sum of `a[b]` for `min(n, k)` iterations; `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for `min(n, k)` iterations; `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for `min(n, k)` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and two lists `p` and `a` of length `n`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given inputs. Specifically, if the conditions are met, it performs certain calculations and returns a value; otherwise, it may handle errors or return a specific message.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
