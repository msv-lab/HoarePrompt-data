Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers read from the input with `b` decremented by 1, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is decremented by 1, `sp` is `a[s]`.**

In this output state, the value of `sp` is assigned the value of the element at index `s` in the list `a`. All other variables retain their initial values except for `s` and `sp`, which have been updated as described.
