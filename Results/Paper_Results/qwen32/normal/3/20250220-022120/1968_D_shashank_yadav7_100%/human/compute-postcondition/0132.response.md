The value of `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. Given that `k` is -1, the expression evaluates to `a[s] * -1 + sp` or `-a[s] + sp`. Therefore, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `-a[s] + 2 * a[s]`, which simplifies to `sm = max(sm, a[s])`.

Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s])`, `bm` is `max(a[b], max(0, bp))`, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
