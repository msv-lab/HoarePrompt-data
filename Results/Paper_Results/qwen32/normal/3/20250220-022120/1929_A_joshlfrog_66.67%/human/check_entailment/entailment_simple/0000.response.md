Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. According to the problem description, the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this sum, the optimal arrangement would be to sort the array in ascending or descending order. 

However, the given program does not sort the array. Instead, it finds the maximum value `x` and the minimum value `y` in the array and prints their difference (`x - y`). This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the cumulative effect of differences between consecutive elements in a sorted order. 

The beauty of the array can be maximized by arranging the elements in either ascending or descending order, which results in the maximum possible differences between consecutive elements. The correct approach would involve sorting the array and then calculating the sum of consecutive differences.

Example:
For the array [100, 54, 80, 43, 90], the maximum beauty can be obtained by sorting it in ascending order [43, 54, 80, 90, 100] and then calculating the beauty as (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57.

The given program would output 100 - 43 = 57 for this example, which is coincidentally correct for this specific case but does not guarantee correctness for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
