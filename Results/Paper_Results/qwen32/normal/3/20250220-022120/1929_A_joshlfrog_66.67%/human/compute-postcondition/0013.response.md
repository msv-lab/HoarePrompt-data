The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `l` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `nums`, `y`, and `x` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `l` is greater than or equal to 1; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; if `nums[i]` is less than `y` (which is initially 100000000), then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `y` remains 100000000. If the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `x` (which is initially 0), then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains 0.**
