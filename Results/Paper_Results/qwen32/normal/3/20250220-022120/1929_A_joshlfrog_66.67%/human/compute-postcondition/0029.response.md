Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `l` is the integer value provided by the user input; `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is 0; `y` is 100000000; `e` is `e + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` has been set to 100000000. All other variables retain their initial values as the code snippet only modifies `y`.
