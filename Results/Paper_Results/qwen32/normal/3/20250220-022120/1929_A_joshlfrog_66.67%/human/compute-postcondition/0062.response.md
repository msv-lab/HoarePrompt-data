The code snippet assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `x`. The values of `t`, `l`, `nums`, `e`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `l` is greater than 0, `nums` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `e` is `e + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `nums[i]`.**
