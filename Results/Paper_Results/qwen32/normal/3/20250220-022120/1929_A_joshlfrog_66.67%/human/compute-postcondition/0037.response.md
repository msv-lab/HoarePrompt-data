The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index that has been processed, and `l` is the total number of iterations (or the length of the list `nums`).

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value. The value of `l` remains the same as it represents the total number of iterations.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `l` is greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `e` is `e + 1`, `x` has been updated to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than the previous `x`, otherwise `x` remains unchanged, and `y` is updated to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than the previous `y`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**
