The code snippet `y = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `y`. According to the initial state, `y` was previously set to 100000000 and `nums[i]` is less than `y`. Therefore, `y` will now hold the value of `nums[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `l`, `nums`, `e`, and `x`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `nums[i]` is less than `y` is no longer valid after the assignment because `y` is now equal to `nums[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `l` is greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `e` is `e + 1`, `x` has been updated to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than the previous `x`, otherwise `x` remains unchanged, `y` is `nums[i]`.**
