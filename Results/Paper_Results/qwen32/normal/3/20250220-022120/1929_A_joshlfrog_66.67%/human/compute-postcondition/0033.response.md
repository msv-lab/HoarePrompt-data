Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `l` is greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `e` is `e + 1`, and if `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged and `y` remains 100000000.**
