Reasoning:

The program is attempting to construct a permutation `p` based on the array `a` as described in the problem. However, the logic used in the provided code does not correctly implement the rules given in the problem statement. The key issue lies in how the `mex` (minimum excludant) is being calculated and used to determine the permutation `p`.

Here are the main problems in the code:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array. The code does not correctly keep track of the MEX as it constructs the permutation `p`. Instead, it seems to be using a simplified heuristic that does not guarantee the correct MEX at each step.

2. **Handling Negative Values in `a`**: The code attempts to handle negative values in `a` by calculating `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. This approach is not consistent with the problem's rules, which define `a_i` as `MEX(p_1, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The code does not correctly reverse this relationship to find `p_i`.

3. **Updating `minn` and `maxx`**: The variables `minn` and `maxx` are used in a way that does not reflect the correct logic for finding the MEX and constructing the permutation. The logic for updating these variables is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly generate a valid permutation `p` for the given array `a`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
