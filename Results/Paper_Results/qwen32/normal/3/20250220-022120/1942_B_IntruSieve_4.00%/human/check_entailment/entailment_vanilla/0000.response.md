Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` of length `n` from the array `a` of length `n`.
- `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program provided is incomplete and does not correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the `mex` value. The `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `p`.
   - The program uses a variable `minn` to track the smallest unused number, but it does not consider the presence of numbers in `p` correctly.
   - The `maxx` variable is also not used correctly to update the `mex`.

2. **Handling Negative Values in `a`**:
   - When `a[i]` is negative, the program calculates `mex[i]` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. This approach is incorrect because the `mex` should be determined based on the presence of numbers in `p`, not derived from the absolute difference.

3. **Tracking Used Numbers**:
   - The program does not maintain a set or list to track which numbers have been used in the permutation `p`. This is necessary to correctly determine the `mex` at each step.

#### Correct Approach:
- We need to maintain a set or list to track the numbers used in the permutation `p`.
- For each `a[i]`, calculate the `mex` as the smallest non-negative integer not in the set of used numbers.
- Set `p[i]` to `mex + a[i]` and add `p[i]` to the set of used numbers.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` based on the array `a`.

**Correctness: False**

The program needs to be revised to correctly track used numbers and compute the `mex` at each step.
