Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `i + 2`. If `arr[i] > 0`, `mex` has `minn` appended to it, and if `minn` was equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is set to `maxx + 1`; otherwise, `minn` remains unchanged. If `arr[i] <= 0`, `mex` has `abs(arr[i] - minn)` appended to it, and if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.**
