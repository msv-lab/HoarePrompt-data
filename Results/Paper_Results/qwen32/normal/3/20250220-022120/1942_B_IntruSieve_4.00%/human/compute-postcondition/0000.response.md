The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input. The other variables (`t`, `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n.**
