The impact of the code is that `minn` is updated to be `maxx + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values. Given that `minn` was initially equal to `maxx`, it is now set to one more than its previous value. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mex` is a list containing the integer 0; `minn` is equal to `maxx + 1`; the current element `arr[i]` is greater than 0.**
