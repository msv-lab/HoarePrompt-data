Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, then `mex` is a list containing the integer 0, `minn` is equal to `maxx + 1` if `minn` was originally equal to `maxx`, otherwise `minn` remains unchanged, and `maxx` remains unchanged. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, then `mex` is a list containing `abs(arr[i])`, `minn` is set to 0, and `maxx` is updated to `-arr[i]` if the absolute value of the difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged.**
