The code snippet `minn = maxx + 1` updates the value of `minn` to be `maxx + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `i + 2`; `mex` has `minn` appended to it; `minn` is `maxx + 1`.**
