Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `i + 1`. If `minn` was equal to `maxx`, `mex` has an additional element which is the value of `minn` (before the update), and `minn` is updated to `maxx + 1`. Otherwise, `mex` and `minn` remain unchanged.**
