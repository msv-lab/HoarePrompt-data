The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so for the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 again.

Let's summarize the state adjustments:
- `i` is currently `i + 1` from the previous iteration, so for the next iteration, it should be `i + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `i + 2`.**
