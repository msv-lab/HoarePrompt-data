The given initial state and the print statement do not provide enough context to determine the exact value of `itm` being printed. The variable `itm` is not defined in the provided initial state, and there is no information about how `itm` is set or calculated in the provided code snippet or initial state description.

Since `itm` is not defined or related to any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, we cannot determine its value precisely. Therefore, based on the given information, we can only state that the code attempts to print the value of `itm` followed by a space.

Output: **itm (where itm is the value of the variable `itm`)**
