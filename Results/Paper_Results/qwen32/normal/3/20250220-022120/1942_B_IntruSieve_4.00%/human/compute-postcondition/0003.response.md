The given code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `minn`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `mex`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0.**
