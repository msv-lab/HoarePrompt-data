The code snippet provided increments the value of `minn` by 1. No other variables in the initial state are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `i + 1`; `mex` has an additional element which is the value of `minn`; `minn` is `minn + 1`.**
