Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to construct a permutation \( p \) from an array \( a \) where each element \( a_i \) is defined as \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The MEX (minimum excludant) of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to construct the permutation \( p \) as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list, intended to store the elements of the permutation \( p \).
   - `minn` and `maxx` are initialized to 0. `minn` is supposed to keep track of the smallest unused number, and `maxx` is supposed to keep track of the largest number in the `mex` list.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - For each element in the input array `arr`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, the program appends `minn` to `mex` and then increments `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `minn` again. This logic seems flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the MEX calculation.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, the program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. It also updates `maxx` if the appended value is greater than `maxx`. This approach doesn't align with the problem's requirement to calculate the MEX.

### Flaws in the Program
- The program does not correctly calculate the MEX for each prefix of the permutation. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `p`, which is not what the program does.
- The logic for handling positive and non-positive values of `arr[i]` does not align with the problem's definition of how `a_i` is calculated from `p_i`.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Initialize a set to keep track of used numbers.
2. For each element in `arr`, calculate the MEX of the current set of used numbers.
3. Determine `p_i` as `MEX - arr[i]`.
4. Ensure `p_i` is a valid number (i.e., not already used and within the range [0, n-1]).
5. Add `p_i` to the set of used numbers and the permutation `p`.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis above, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to construct the permutation `p` from the array `a`.

**Correctness: False**
