The code snippet `mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))` appends the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to the list `mex`. 

Given the initial state, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `i` is `i + 2`.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `i` remains `i + 2` (since `i` is not reassigned within the snippet), and the list `mex` gains a new element, which is the absolute value of the difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `i + 2`; `mex` has a new element which is `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.**
