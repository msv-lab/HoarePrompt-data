You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given array \( a \). Let's analyze the logic and identify the issues.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of \( \text{MEX} \)**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the \( \text{MEX} \) of the array \( p \) up to the current index \( i \). It does not properly track the minimum non-negative integer that is not present in the constructed \( p \) up to index \( i \).
   - The program uses `minn` to track the smallest non-negative integer not yet used, but it does not correctly handle the case when `arr[i]` is negative or when the smallest unused integer changes due to the values of `arr[i]`.

2. **Handling Negative Values in \( a \)**:
   - The program incorrectly handles negative values in \( a \). For negative values, it calculates the element of \( p \) as `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, which is not the correct approach to determine the \( \text{MEX} \).

3. **Updating `minn` and `maxx`**:
   - The program updates `minn` and `maxx` in a way that does not ensure the correct \( \text{MEX} \) is calculated. Specifically, `minn` is incremented only when `arr[i]` is positive, which is not a reliable method to track the smallest unused integer.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

The program's output might be something like:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

However, the program might not correctly handle the case where `arr[i]` is negative, leading to incorrect values in the permutation \( p \).

### Correct Approach:

To correctly construct the permutation \( p \), we need to:
1. Track the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in \( p \).
2. For each element \( a_i \), determine the corresponding \( p_i \) such that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
3. Use a set or a boolean array to efficiently track which integers have been used in \( p \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = 0
    used = set()
    p = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        p_i = mex - arr[i]
        used.add(p_i)
        p.append(p_i)
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

This corrected program ensures that the \( \text{MEX} \) is correctly calculated and that each element of \( p \) is properly determined based on the given \( a \).
