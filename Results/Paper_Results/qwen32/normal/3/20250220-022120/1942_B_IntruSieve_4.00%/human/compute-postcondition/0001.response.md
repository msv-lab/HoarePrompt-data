The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `arr`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n. However, these initial values are not directly affected by the execution of the provided code snippet.

The new variable `arr` is introduced and will hold the list of integers obtained from the input. Therefore, the output state will include this new variable.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ `a_i` ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
