### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. However, there are several issues with the logic used in the code, which makes it incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**:
   - The program uses `minn` to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation. However, the logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if minn == maxx: minn = maxx + 1` does not accurately reflect the MEX calculation, which should consider all numbers used so far.

2. **Handling of Negative Values**:
   - For negative values in `a`, the program calculates `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to determine the next element in `p`. This approach does not correctly reflect the MEX operation and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **State of `mex` List**:
   - The `mex` list is not correctly built to reflect the permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`. The values in `mex` do not necessarily correspond to a valid permutation of `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The output of the program does not guarantee a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program is incorrect. It does not correctly construct a valid permutation `p` based on the array `a`.

**Correctness: False**
