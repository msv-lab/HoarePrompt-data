The code snippet `nodes[u].append(v)` modifies the `nodes` dictionary by appending the value `v` to the list associated with the key `u`. 

Given the initial state, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key defaults to an empty list. Therefore, if `u` is not already a key in `nodes`, `nodes[u]` will be an empty list which then gets `v` appended to it. If `u` is already a key, `v` is simply added to the existing list of values for that key.

The variables `start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where `nodes[u]` includes `v` in its list; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, which is a key in the `nodes` dictionary; `n` must be at least 2; `t` is an integer provided by the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `u` and `v` are integers provided by the input.**
