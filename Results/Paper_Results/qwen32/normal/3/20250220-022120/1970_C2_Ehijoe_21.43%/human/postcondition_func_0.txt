The function `func_1` calculates and returns a list of distances from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph, represented as a dictionary where keys are nodes and values are lists of neighboring nodes. If a node has only one neighbor which is its parent, it returns `[0]`. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances for all valid neighboring nodes and returns a list of these incremented distances.
