Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where keys are integers representing nodes and values are lists of integers representing neighboring nodes; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, which is a key in the nodes dictionary; `n` and `t` are integers provided by the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True.**

Explanation: The code snippet only initializes the variable `empty` to `True`. The values of `nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, and `edges` remain unchanged.
