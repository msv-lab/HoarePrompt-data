To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n - 1)`, which means the variables `i` and `n` are the only ones we can adjust directly.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 1. This means `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly initialized in the provided state, but it will be set to 0 by the `range` function when the loop begins.

Given this, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`nodes`, `start`, `edges`, `empty`) are not directly related to the loop's execution condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

So, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`nodes` is a defaultdict where the default value for each key is an empty list; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, which is a key in the nodes dictionary; `n` must be at least 2; `t` is an integer provided by the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True**.
