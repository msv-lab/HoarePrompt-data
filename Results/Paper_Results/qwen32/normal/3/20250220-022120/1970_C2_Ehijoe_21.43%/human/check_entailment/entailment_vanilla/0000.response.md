To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves a game played on a tree with `n` nodes. In each round, a stone starts on a given node, and players Ron and Hermione take turns moving the stone to an adjacent inactive node. Ron makes the first move. The player who cannot make a move loses. The game is played optimally by both players.

The key to solving this problem is to determine the parity (odd or even) of the maximum distance from the starting node to any leaf node in the tree. If this maximum distance is odd, Ron wins, because he can force Hermione into a position where she loses. If the maximum distance is even, Hermione wins, because she can force Ron into a position where he loses.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided Python program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the distances from a given starting node to all leaf nodes in the subtree rooted at that node.
   - It recursively explores each child node (excluding the parent node to avoid cycles).
   - It returns a list of distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes in its subtree.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the input values for the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1 in this version).
   - It constructs the tree using an adjacency list representation.
   - It identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with only one edge, excluding the root).
   - It reads the starting node for the round.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes.
   - It checks if there is any odd distance in the list of distances. If there is, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

### Correctness Verification

- **Tree Construction**: The tree is correctly constructed using an adjacency list.
- **Leaf Node Identification**: The program correctly identifies leaf nodes.
- **Distance Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the distances from the starting node to all leaf nodes.
- **Winning Condition**: The program correctly checks the parity of the maximum distance. If there is any odd distance, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins. This logic aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the parity of the maximum distance from the starting node to any leaf node in the tree.

Correctness: **True**
