Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default value for each key is an empty list; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, which is a key in the nodes dictionary; `n` and `t` are integers provided by the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    nodes[u].append(v)
    nodes[v].append(u)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nodes` is a defaultdict where `nodes[u]` includes `v` in its list and `nodes[v]` includes `u` in its list; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, which is a key in the `nodes` dictionary; `n` must be at least 2; `t` is an integer provided by the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `u` and `v` are integers provided by the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nodes` is a defaultdict where `nodes[u]` includes `v` in its list and `nodes[v]` includes `u` in its list; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, which is a key in the `nodes` dictionary; `n` must be at least 2; `t` is an integer provided by the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `u` and `v` are integers provided by the input; `i` is 1; `u` and `v` are the values read from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nodes` is a defaultdict where `nodes[u]` includes `v` in its list and `nodes[v]` includes `u` in its list; `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the game, which is a key in the `nodes` dictionary; `n` must be at least 2; `t` is an integer provided by the input; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `u` and `v` are integers provided by the input; `i` is 2; `u` and `v` are the values read from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
