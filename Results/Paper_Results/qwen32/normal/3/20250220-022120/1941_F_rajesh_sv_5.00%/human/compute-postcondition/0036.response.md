The given code snippet calculates the midpoint between two variables `l` and `h` using the formula `mid = l + (h - l) // 2`. This formula is commonly used to avoid potential overflow issues that might occur with `(l + h) // 2` in other programming languages, although Python's integers are of arbitrary precision and do not overflow in the same way.

Given that `mid` is being assigned a new value based on `l` and `h`, the values of `l` and `h` remain unchanged. The new value of `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.

Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `l` is unchanged; `h` is unchanged.**
