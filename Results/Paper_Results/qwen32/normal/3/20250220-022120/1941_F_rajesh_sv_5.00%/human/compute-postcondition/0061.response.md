Output State: **`l` is the index found by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`, `h` is the index found by `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in `F`.**

Explanation: The variable `h` is updated to the value of `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`. The values of `l`, `ans`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial state as per the given code snippet.
