Postcondition: **`A` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()`, `n` is at least 4, `m` and `k` are values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers from `A`, `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `i` is 5, `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.**
