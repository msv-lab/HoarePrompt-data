Output State: **`l` is updated to `mid + 1` or remains the smallest index such that `D[l] > left - f` and `l < h`. `h` is updated to the largest index in `D` such that `D[h] < right - f` and `h > l` or remains equal to `mid`. `mid` is now equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`. `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`. `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`. Ensure `l < h` after updates.**

In simpler terms, the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` have been updated to `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively, while the values of `l`, `h`, and `mid` remain as per their initial state conditions.
