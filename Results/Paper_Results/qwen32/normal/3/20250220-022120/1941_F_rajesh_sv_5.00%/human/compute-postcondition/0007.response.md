Output State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus `testcases`, where `0 <= testcases - testcases <= 10^4 - testcases`**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all the iterations, the value of `testcases` will be 0, as the loop will have run the number of times equal to the initial value returned by `func_3()`. Each iteration of the loop decrements the effective value of `testcases` by 1 until it reaches 0.
