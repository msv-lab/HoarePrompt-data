Functionality: **The function calculates and prints the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `A` of problem complexities, adjusted by the complexities in list `F` of function complexities, and compares it with the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`. The output is the larger of these two values.**
