Postcondition: **`l` and `h` are indices in `D`, `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, and `D` must have at least two elements with `left - f` less than some element in `D` and `right - f` greater than some element in `D`. `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f` and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`. `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.**
