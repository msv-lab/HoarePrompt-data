The value of `h` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The values of `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged. The precondition that `h` must be at least `l + 1` is still valid but needs to be checked with the new value of `h`.

Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `h` is `mid`**.
