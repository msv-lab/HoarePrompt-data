The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `index`. Given that `i` is 4, `index` will now hold the value 4. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`A` is a list of integers returned by `func_4()`, `n` is at least 4, `m` and `k` are values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers from `A`, `F` is the list returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found so far, `index` is 4, `i` is 4, `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`.**
