The code calculates the midpoint `mid` between `l` and `h` using the formula `mid = l + (h - l) // 2`. This does not affect the values of `l`, `h`, `D`, `left`, `f`, or `right`. The only change is the introduction of the new variable `mid`.

Output State: **`l` is the index found by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`, `h` is the index found by `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `D` must have at least two elements, `left - f` must be less than some element in `D`, and `right - f` must be greater than some element in `D`**.
