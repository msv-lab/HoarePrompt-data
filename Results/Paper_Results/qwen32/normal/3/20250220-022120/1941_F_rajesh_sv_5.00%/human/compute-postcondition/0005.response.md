Let's break down the task step by step.

Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 1, where `0 <= testcases - 1 <= 10^4 - 1`
- The for loop statement: `for _ in range(testcases):`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the state of `testcases` as it is the only variable in the loop head.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `testcases` is greater than 0. In each iteration, the loop variable `_` (which is unused) takes on the values from 0 to `testcases - 1`.
2. **Adjusting `testcases`**: At the end of each iteration, the loop implicitly decrements the effective count of `testcases` by 1 (since it iterates `testcases` times). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

### Given State:
- `testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 1, i.e., `testcases = func_3() - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` should be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
Given that `testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 1, for the next iteration, `testcases` should be `func_3() - 2` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 2, where `0 <= testcases - 1 <= 10^4 - 2`**
