The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 5. The variable `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`A` is a sorted list of `n` integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems; `m` is unchanged; `k` is unchanged; `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by `func_4()`, and `F` is equal to `D`; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 5; `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[4] - A[3]` and `index` is set to 4. Otherwise, if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[4] - A[3]`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.**
