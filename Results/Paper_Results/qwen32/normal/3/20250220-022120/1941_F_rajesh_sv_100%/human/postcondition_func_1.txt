The function accepts a tuple `args` containing any number of arguments. It returns the value associated with the key `args` in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is not already in `d`, it computes the result of `func(*args)`, stores it in `d` with `args` as the key, and then returns this value. If `args` is already in `d`, it simply returns the existing value without any further computation.
