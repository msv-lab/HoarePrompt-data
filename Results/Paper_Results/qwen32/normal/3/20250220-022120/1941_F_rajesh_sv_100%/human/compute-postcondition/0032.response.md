Output State: **A is a sorted list of n integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems; m is unchanged; k is unchanged; D is a sorted list of unique integers returned by func_4(), and F is equal to D; max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A; next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A; index is the index of the element in A that, when subtracted by its previous element, gives the maximum difference.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `max_diff` holds the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `A`. The variable `next_max_diff` holds the second largest such difference. The variable `index` points to the position in the list `A` where this maximum difference occurs. The variables `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
