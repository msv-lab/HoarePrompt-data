The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the current iteration, and `testcases`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will execute.

At the end of the previous iteration, `testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation, we only need to adjust `testcases` for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must be decremented by 1, as each iteration of the loop reduces `testcases` by 1.

State: **`testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()` minus 1 and must be greater than 0**
