The code snippet provided uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `left - f` in the sorted list `D`. This means `l` will be the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f`.

Given the initial state, we need to determine the value of `l` based on the values of `left`, `f`, and the sorted list `D`.

Since the exact values of `left` and `f` are not specified, we can only describe the position of `l` in terms of `D`.

Output State: **`A` is a sorted list of n integers, `m` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by func_4() that must have at least 1 element, `F` is equal to `D`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that, when subtracted by its previous element, gives the maximum difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`, `f` is the first element of `F`, `l` is the index in `D` where `left - f` would be inserted to maintain sorted order.**
