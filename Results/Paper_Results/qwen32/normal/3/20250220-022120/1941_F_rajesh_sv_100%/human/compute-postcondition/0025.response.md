Output State: **`A` is a sorted list of `n` integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems; `m` is unchanged; `k` is unchanged; `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by `func_4()`, and `F` is equal to `D`; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 5; `diff` is `A[5] - A[4]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[5] - A[4]` and `index` is set to 5. Otherwise, if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[5] - A[4]`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `diff` has been updated to the difference between the 6th and 5th elements of the list `A`. The values of `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` may change based on the new value of `diff`, but their specific values are not determined without additional information. All other variables remain unchanged.
