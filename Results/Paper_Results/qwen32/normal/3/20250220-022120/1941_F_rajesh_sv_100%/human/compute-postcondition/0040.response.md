The code snippet assigns values to `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` based on the current values of `D`, `f`, and `mid`.

Given:
- `D` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements.
- `f` is the first element of `F`, and `F` is equal to `D`, so `f` is the first element of `D`.
- `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, where `l` and `h` are indices in `D` such that `l < h`.

The new assignments are:
- `mid_sum` is assigned the value `D[mid] + f`.
- `mid_next_sum` is assigned the value `D[mid + 1] + f`.

No other variables are changed.

Output State: **`A` is a sorted list of n integers, `m` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, `F` is equal to `D`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that, when subtracted by its previous element, gives the maximum difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is `max_diff`, `f` is the first element of `F`, `l` is the index in `D` where `left - f` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `l < h`.**
