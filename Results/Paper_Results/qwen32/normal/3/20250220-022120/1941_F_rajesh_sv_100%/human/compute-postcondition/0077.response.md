Output State: **`A` is a sorted list of n integers, `m` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least 2 elements, `F` is equal to `D`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that, when subtracted by its previous element, gives the maximum difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `f` is the second element of `F`, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is `mid`.**

In this output state, the variable `h` has been updated to the value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
