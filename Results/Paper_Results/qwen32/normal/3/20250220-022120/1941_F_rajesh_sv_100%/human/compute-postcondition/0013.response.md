Output State: **`A` is a sorted list of `n` integers representing the complexities of the prepared problems; `m` is unchanged; `k` is unchanged; `D` is a sorted list of unique integers returned by `func_4()`, and `F` is equal to `D`; `max_diff` is `-inf`; `next_max_diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`; `index` is `None`; `n` must be greater than 1; `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, and `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff`; the current value of `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`.**

Natural Language: The value of `next_max_diff` has been updated to the current value of `diff`, which is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
