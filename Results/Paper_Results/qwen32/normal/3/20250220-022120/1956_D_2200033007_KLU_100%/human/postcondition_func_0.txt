The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, representing a range within an array `arr`. It returns a computed value based on this range, which is stored in a dictionary `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations. The returned value is the maximum of several possible sums involving elements of `arr` within the specified range, ensuring that the result is at least 1.
