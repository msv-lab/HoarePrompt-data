You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `make_stairs` modifies a subarray of `arr` starting from `start_index` to form a staircase pattern based on the value of `i`. If the subarray is already in the staircase pattern, no changes are made. Otherwise, it updates the subarray and appends a tuple to the `res` list indicating the range of indices modified. The function returns `None`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Overview of the Problem:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by performing a series of operations where each operation sets a subarray to its MEX (Minimum Excluded Value). The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` by considering different ways to split the subarray and applying the MEX operation.
   - It uses memoization (`res_dict`) to avoid redundant calculations.
   - It considers three scenarios:
     - The subarray is a single element.
     - The entire subarray is set to its MEX.
     - The subarray is split at each position, and the maximum sum is calculated recursively.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function generates the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It recursively determines the optimal way to split the subarray and applies the MEX operation.
   - It handles the case where the entire subarray can be set to its MEX and delegates the task of making a subarray into a staircase to `make_stairs`.

3. **Function `make_stairs`:**
   - This function transforms a subarray into a staircase pattern where the first element is 0, the second is 1, and so on up to `i`.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired staircase pattern.
   - It recursively applies the MEX operation to transform the subarray into the staircase pattern.

#### Issues in the Program:

1. **Global Variables:**
   - The program uses global variables `arr`, `res_dict`, `res`, and `start_index` without proper initialization or passing them as parameters.
   - This can lead to errors and incorrect behavior, especially when recursive calls are made.

2. **Logic in `make_stairs`:**
   - The function `make_stairs` modifies the global `arr` array directly, which is not ideal for a recursive function.
   - The logic for transforming the subarray into a staircase pattern is not entirely clear and may not handle all edge cases correctly.

3. **Handling of MEX:**
   - The program does not explicitly calculate the MEX for any subarray. Instead, it assumes that setting the subarray to its length squared (`length ** 2`) is the optimal solution when the entire subarray is set to its MEX.
   - This assumption is incorrect because the MEX of a subarray is not necessarily the length of the subarray.

4. **Output Construction:**
   - The program constructs the sequence of operations in `res` but does not ensure that the operations are valid or that the final array sum is maximized.
   - The operations may not be optimal or may exceed the allowed number of operations.

#### Conclusion:
The program has several issues with global variables, incorrect assumptions about the MEX operation, and insufficient validation of the operations. These issues suggest that the program may not always produce the correct output.
