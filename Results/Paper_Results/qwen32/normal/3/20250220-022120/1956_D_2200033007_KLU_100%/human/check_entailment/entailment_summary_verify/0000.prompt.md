You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Input

    0

Output

    1 1
    1 1
    
Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `make_stairs` modifies a subarray of `arr` starting from `start_index` to form a staircase pattern based on the value of `i`. If the subarray is already in the staircase pattern, no changes are made. Otherwise, it updates the subarray and appends a tuple to the `res` list indicating the range of indices modified. The function returns `None`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not seem to correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. Here are a few issues and potential edge cases that the program does not handle correctly:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The code provided is incomplete. Functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` are defined, but they are not fully utilized or integrated properly. For instance, `make_stairs` is called within `func_2` but it relies on a global variable `start_index` which is not defined within the scope of the function.

2. **Lack of Global Variables**: The code uses global variables like `arr`, `res_dict`, and `res` without defining them in the function scope. This can lead to errors or unexpected behavior if these variables are not properly initialized elsewhere in the code.

3. **Logic for Finding MEX**: The problem requires finding the MEX (Minimum EXcluded Value) of a subarray and then replacing the subarray with this MEX value. However, the provided code does not explicitly compute the MEX of any subarray. Instead, it seems to focus on maximizing the sum based on some heuristic or precomputed values, which might not always yield the correct result.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same, arrays with a single element, or arrays with very large values. For example:
   - **Single Element Array**: The code should correctly handle arrays with a single element, but it does not explicitly handle this case.
   - **All Elements Same**: If all elements in the array are the same, the MEX should be the next integer that is not in the array. The code does not ensure this.
   - **Large Values**: The code does not account for the possibility of large values in the array, which might require careful handling to ensure the MEX is computed correctly.

5. **Output Format**: The code does not produce the required output format, which includes the maximum sum and the sequence of operations. The provided functions do not return the correct format and do not handle the output requirements as specified in the problem statement.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
3
1 1 1
```
The MEX of the entire array is `0`, but the code does not correctly compute this and might not replace the array elements with the correct MEX values to maximize the sum. The expected output should be:
```
3 0
```
Since no operations are needed to maximize the sum. The provided code does not handle this correctly.

Thus, due to these issues and the lack of proper handling of edge cases, the program is incorrect.
