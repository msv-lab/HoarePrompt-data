Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate or not. We'll compare the program's logic with the problem requirements and the function summaries.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function seems to be computing some value related to the maximum sum that can be achieved by performing operations on the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - **Logic**: It uses a recursive approach with memoization (`res_dict`) to store the results of subproblems. It considers different ways to split the subarray and computes the maximum value that can be achieved.
   - **Issue**: The function does not explicitly compute the MEX of any subarray. Instead, it seems to be using some heuristic to maximize the sum, which might not always yield the correct result.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function seems to be generating the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - **Logic**: It relies on the results computed by `func_1` to determine the best sequence of operations.
   - **Issue**: It uses a global variable `start_index` which is not defined within the function, leading to potential errors.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function modifies the subarray to form a staircase pattern.
   - **Logic**: It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase pattern. If not, it modifies the subarray and appends the operation to the `res` list.
   - **Function Summary**: The summary accurately describes the function's behavior, but it does not explicitly mention the dependency on the global variable `start_index`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The program is incomplete and lacks proper integration of the functions. The global variables `arr`, `res_dict`, and `res` are used without being defined properly within the function scope.

2. **Lack of MEX Calculation**:
   - The program does not explicitly compute the MEX of any subarray. Instead, it seems to use some heuristic to maximize the sum, which might not always yield the correct result.

3. **Global Variable Usage**:
   - The functions rely on global variables (`arr`, `res_dict`, `res`, `start_index`), which can lead to errors or unexpected behavior if not properly initialized.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same, arrays with a single element, or arrays with very large values effectively.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not produce the required output format, which includes the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

### Example Case Analysis:

Consider the input:
```
3
1 1 1
```
The MEX of the entire array is `0`, but the code does not correctly compute this and might not replace the array elements with the correct MEX values to maximize the sum. The expected output should be:
```
3 0
```
Since no operations are needed to maximize the sum. The provided code does not handle this correctly.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. It lacks proper handling of edge cases, does not compute the MEX correctly, and relies on global variables in an unsafe manner.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect.
