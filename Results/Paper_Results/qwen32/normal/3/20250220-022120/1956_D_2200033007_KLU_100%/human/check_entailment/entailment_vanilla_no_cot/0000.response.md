Correctness: **False**

The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the given problem:

1. **Global Variables**: The functions `func_2` and `make_stairs` use the global variable `start_index` which is not defined within these functions. This will lead to a `NameError`.

2. **Dictionary `res_dict`**: The dictionary `res_dict` is used in `func_1` to store results of subproblems for memoization, but it is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will lead to a `NameError`.

3. **Result List `res`**: The list `res` is used to store operations in `func_2` and `make_stairs`, but it is not defined anywhere in the provided code. This will lead to a `NameError`.

4. **Logic in `make_stairs`**: The function `make_stairs` attempts to construct a sequence of operations to turn a subarray into a "staircase" sequence. However, the logic is incorrect and does not handle all cases properly. Additionally, it modifies the array `arr` directly, which might not be the intended behavior.

5. **Handling of MEX**: The calculation of MEX in `func_1` is not correctly implemented. It does not compute the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the subarray, but instead, it seems to be trying to maximize the sum by using a different logic which is not aligned with the problem statement.

6. **Recursive Calls in `func_2`**: The function `func_2` recursively calls itself to find the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum. However, the logic for choosing the subproblems to solve recursively and combining their results is not correct.

7. **Output Format**: The functions do not produce the required output format. The main function that calls `func_1` and `func_2` is missing, and the output is not formatted as required.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be rewritten to correctly compute the MEX for subarrays, store intermediate results using memoization, and construct the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum. Additionally, global variables and data structures like `res_dict` and `res` should be properly defined and used.
