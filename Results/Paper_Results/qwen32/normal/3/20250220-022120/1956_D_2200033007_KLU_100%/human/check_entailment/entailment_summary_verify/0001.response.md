### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the provided function summaries, systematically addressing the original assessment.

#### Overview of the Problem:
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by performing a series of operations where each operation sets a subarray to its MEX (Minimum Excluded Value). The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

#### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Purpose:** Calculate the maximum possible sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` by considering different ways to split the subarray and applying the MEX operation.
   - **Memoization:** Uses `res_dict` to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
   - **Scenarios Considered:**
     - **Single Element:** If `start_index == end_index`, it returns `max(1, arr[start_index])` because the MEX of a single element is at least 1.
     - **Entire Subarray to MEX:** It calculates `(end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2` which seems incorrect as this does not directly represent the MEX value.
     - **Splitting Subarray:** It considers splitting the subarray at each position and recursively calculates the maximum sum.
     - **Including Ends:** It also considers including the first or last element of the subarray and then recursively calculating the maximum sum for the remaining part.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Purpose:** Generate the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - **Recursive Strategy:** It recursively determines the optimal way to split the subarray and applies the MEX operation.
   - **Handling MEX:** It uses the result from `func_1` to decide whether to split the subarray or set the entire subarray to its MEX.

3. **Function `make_stairs`:**
   - **Purpose:** Transform a subarray into a staircase pattern where the first element is 0, the second is 1, and so on up to `i`.
   - **Logic:** It checks if the subarray is already in the desired staircase pattern. If not, it recursively applies the MEX operation to transform the subarray.
   - **Function Summary:** This matches the description provided.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Assumption about MEX:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that setting the entire subarray to its length squared (`length ** 2`) is the optimal solution when the entire subarray is set to its MEX.
   - The MEX of a subarray is not necessarily the length of the subarray. It is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.

2. **Global Variables:**
   - The program uses global variables `arr`, `res_dict`, `res`, and `start_index` without proper initialization or passing them as parameters.
   - This can lead to errors and incorrect behavior, especially when recursive calls are made.

3. **Output Construction:**
   - The program constructs the sequence of operations in `res` but does not ensure that the operations are valid or that the final array sum is maximized.
   - The operations may not be optimal or may exceed the allowed number of operations.

4. **Memoization and Recursion:**
   - While memoization is used to avoid redundant calculations, the logic to calculate the MEX and the recursive strategy to split the array are flawed.
   - The recursive approach might not explore all possible ways to maximize the sum.

#### Correctness:

Given the above analysis, the program has several fundamental issues:

- The incorrect assumption about the MEX value.
- The use of global variables leading to potential errors.
- The recursive strategy not ensuring optimal operations.
- The output construction not being validated for correctness.

These issues suggest that the program may not always produce the correct output.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
