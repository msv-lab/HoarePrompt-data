Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the size of an array `a`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` which are the elements of the array. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the elements of the array. The specific result is not detailed in the provided information, but it is implied that the function performs some computation or check on the array elements.**
