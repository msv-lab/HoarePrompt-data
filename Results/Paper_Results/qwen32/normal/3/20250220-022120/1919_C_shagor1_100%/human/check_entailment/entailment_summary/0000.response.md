### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to understand if it correctly computes the minimum possible penalty.

The problem requires splitting the array into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the sum of penalties `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized. The penalty `p(b)` of a subsequence `b` is defined as the number of indices `i` where `b_i < b_{i+1}`.

The provided program iterates through the array and maintains two variables `la` and `lb`, which seem to represent the last elements added to subsequences `s` and `t`, respectively. The program increments the penalty count `ans` whenever it finds an element that cannot be added to either `s` or `t` without violating the increasing order condition, indicating that a new sequence (or "penalty") is starting.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. Initialize `la` and `lb` to `n + 1` (a value greater than any possible element in the array).
2. Initialize `ans` (the penalty count) to 0.
3. Iterate through each element `i` in the input array:
   - If `i` is less than or equal to `la`, it can be added to subsequence `s`, so update `la` to `i`.
   - Else if `i` is less than or equal to `lb`, it can be added to subsequence `t`, so update `lb` to `i`.
   - If neither condition holds, it means starting a new sequence is necessary to maintain the increasing order condition for both subsequences. Increment `ans` and update `la` and `lb` to start a new sequence with `i`.

This approach ensures that the program tracks the minimum number of penalties required to split the array into two increasing subsequences.

Let's verify this with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `5 1 2 3 4 5`
   - Output: `3`
   - The program correctly identifies that the array can be split into subsequences `s=[2,4,5]` and `t=[1,3]`, resulting in penalties of `2` and `1`, respectively.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `8 8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3`
   - Output: `1`
   - The program correctly identifies that the array can be split into subsequences `s=[8,3,1]` and `t=[2,1,7,4,3]`, resulting in penalties of `0` and `1`, respectively.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `5 3 3 3 3 3`
   - Output: `0`
   - The program correctly identifies that the array can be split into subsequences `s=[]` and `t=[3,3,3,3,3]`, resulting in penalties of `0` and `0`, respectively.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - The program correctly identifies that the array can be split into subsequences `s=[]` and `t=[1]`, resulting in penalties of `0` and `0`, respectively.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `2 2 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - The program correctly identifies that the array can be split into subsequences `s=[2]` and `t=[1]`, resulting in penalties of `0` and `0`, respectively.

Given the analysis and verification with the examples, the program correctly computes the minimum possible penalty for each test case.
