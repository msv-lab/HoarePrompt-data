The only variable in the loop head is `j`. The loop will execute based on the range provided, which is `range(2)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `j` starts within the range that allows the loop to iterate at least once.

Given the loop `for j in range(2):`, the loop will execute if `j` starts at 0 because `range(2)` generates the sequence 0 and 1.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `j` should be set to 0 before the loop starts. The other variables (`t`, `cases`, `i`, `arr`, `lex`, `k`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is [], `lex` is the integer value provided by the user input, `k` is 3**
