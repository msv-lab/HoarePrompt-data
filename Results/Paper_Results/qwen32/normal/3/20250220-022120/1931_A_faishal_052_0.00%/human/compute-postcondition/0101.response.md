The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `arr` is a list containing the integer `26`, and `lex` is an integer greater than 51.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is an integer greater than 51.**
