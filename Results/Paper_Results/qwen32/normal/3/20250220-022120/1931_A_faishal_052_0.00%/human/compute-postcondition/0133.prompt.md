Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    arr = []
    lex = int(input())
    for j in range(2):
        if lex <= 26:
            arr.append(1)
            lex = lex - 1
        elif lex < 52:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
        else:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
    arr.append(lex)
    arr.sort()
    for k in range(3):
        print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1, arr is either [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, lex], or [26, 26, lex], and lex has been adjusted based on its initial value and is now either lex - 2 if the initial lex was less than or equal to 26, or lex - 27 if the initial lex was greater than 26 but less than 52, or lex - 52 if the initial lex was 52 or greater, k is 3

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` is 1, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, cases is greater than 1, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, arr is either [1, 1, lex], [1, lex, 26], or [lex, 26, 26] where lex is adjusted to be between 1 and 26




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
