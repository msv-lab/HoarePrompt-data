To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the given information and analyze each variable involved:

1. **Variable `t`**: This is an integer between 1 and 100. However, this variable is not directly used in the `print` statement, so its value does not affect the output.

2. **Variable `cases`**: This is an integer greater than 1. Similar to `t`, this variable is not directly used in the `print` statement, so its value does not affect the output.

3. **Variable `i`**: This is set to 2. Again, this variable is not directly used in the `print` statement, so its value does not affect the output.

4. **Variable `j`**: This is set to 2. This variable is not directly used in the `print` statement, so its value does not affect the output.

5. **Variable `k`**: This is set to 3. This variable is used in the `print` statement to index into the `arr` list.

6. **Variable `arr`**: This is a list that can be one of three possible configurations:
   - `[1, 1, lex]`
   - `[1, lex, 26]`
   - `[lex, 26, 26]`
   Here, `lex` is a value between 1 and 26.

7. **`print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`**: This statement prints a character based on the value of `arr[k]`. The `chr` function converts an ASCII value to a character. The value `96` is added to `arr[k]` to map the numbers 1 through 26 to the letters 'a' through 'z'.

Given `k` is 3, `arr[k]` refers to the third element of the `arr` list. Let's consider each possible configuration of `arr`:

- If `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, then `arr[k]` is `lex`.
- If `arr` is `[1, lex, 26]`, then `arr[k]` is `26`.
- If `arr` is `[lex, 26, 26]`, then `arr[k]` is `26`.

In each case, we need to convert `arr[k]` to a character using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`:

- If `arr[k]` is `lex` (where `lex` is between 1 and 26), then `chr(lex + 96)` will be the corresponding letter from 'a' to 'z'.
- If `arr[k]` is `26`, then `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which is the character 'z'.

Since `lex` can be any value between 1 and 26, the output will be a letter from 'a' to 'z'. However, in the specific cases where `arr[k]` is explicitly 26, the output will be 'z'.

Therefore, the most precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **a letter from 'a' to 'z'** (where the specific letter depends on the value of `lex` in the list `arr` when `arr[k]` is `lex`, or 'z' if `arr[k]` is 26)
