The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. If `lex` was initially between 0 and 25, it will now be negative. If `lex` was initially greater than 25, it will now be greater than or equal to 0 but less than 26. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `arr` is either [1, 26] or [26, 26], and if `lex` is an integer such that -25 <= lex <= 25, `arr` is [1, 26]. If `lex` is an integer greater than 25, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is now `lex - 26`.**
