Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is an integer greater than 25.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26, so if `lex` was initially greater than 51, after the operation, `lex` will be greater than 25. All other variables remain unchanged.
