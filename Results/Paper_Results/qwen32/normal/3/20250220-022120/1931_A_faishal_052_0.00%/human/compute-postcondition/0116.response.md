Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `arr` is either [1, 1, 1], [1, 26, 1], [26, 1, 1], or [26, 26, 1]. If `lex` was originally between 0 and 25, `arr` is [1, 1, 1] and `lex` is between -1 and 24. If `lex` was originally greater than 25, `arr` is [26, 1, 1] and `lex` is between 24 and 49. If `lex` was originally between -25 and -1, `arr` is [1, 26, 1] and `lex` is between -26 and -2. If `lex` was originally greater than -1, `arr` is [26, 26, 1] and `lex` is between -1 and 24.**

In simple terms, the value of `lex` has been decreased by 1, affecting its range based on its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.
