Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `lex` is `lex - 26`, and `arr` is [26, 26, 26] if `lex` was originally greater than 25 or greater than -1. If `lex` was originally between -25 and -1, `arr` is [1, 26, 26].**

In simpler terms: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. If `lex` was originally greater than 25 or greater than -1, `arr` becomes [26, 26, 26]. If `lex` was originally between -25 and -1, `arr` remains [1, 26, 26]. All other variables remain unchanged.
