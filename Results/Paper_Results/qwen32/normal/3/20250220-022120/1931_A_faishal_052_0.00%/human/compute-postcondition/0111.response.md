The code snippet `lex = lex - 26` modifies the value of `lex` by subtracting 26 from it. 

Given the initial state, `lex` can be in one of two ranges:
1. `0 <= lex <= 25` in which case `arr` is `[1, 26]`.
2. `lex > 25` in which case `arr` is `[26, 26]`.

After the operation `lex = lex - 26`, the new value of `lex` will be:
1. If `0 <= lex <= 25`, then `lex` becomes negative (`-26 <= lex <= -1`), and `arr` remains `[1, 26]`.
2. If `lex > 25`, then `lex` becomes `lex - 26`, and `arr` remains `[26, 26]`.

The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `arr` is either [1, 26] or [26, 26]. If `lex` is an integer such that -26 <= lex <= -1, `arr` is [1, 26]. If `lex` is an integer greater than -1, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`.**
