The code snippet `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Therefore, `arr` changes from an empty list to a list containing the single element `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is [1], `lex` is an integer value provided by the user input and `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `k` is 3**.
