The code snippet appends the value `1` to the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `arr` is updated to include the appended `1`. The value of `lex` is not affected by this operation.

Let's break down the possible states of `arr` before and after the operation:

- If `arr` was originally `[1, 1]`, it becomes `[1, 1, 1]`.
- If `arr` was originally `[1, 26]`, it becomes `[1, 26, 1]`.
- If `arr` was originally `[26, 1]`, it becomes `[26, 1, 1]`.
- If `arr` was originally `[26, 26]`, it becomes `[26, 26, 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `arr` is either [1, 1, 1], [1, 26, 1], [26, 1, 1], or [26, 26, 1]. If `lex` was originally between 0 and 25, `arr` is [1, 1, 1] and `lex` is unchanged. If `lex` was originally greater than 25, `arr` is [26, 1, 1] and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is greater than 25 after the if-else block, `arr` is [26, 26, 1] and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` was originally between -25 and -1, `arr` is [1, 26, 1]. If `lex` was originally greater than -1, `arr` is [26, 26, 1] and `lex` is `lex - 26`.**
