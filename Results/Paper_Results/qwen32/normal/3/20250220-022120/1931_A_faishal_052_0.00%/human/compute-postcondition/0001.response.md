The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 does not affect whether the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0 and `i` is the loop variable that will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
