Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `arr` is either [1, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], [26, 1, 26], or [26, 26, 26]. If `lex` was originally between 0 and 25, `arr` is [1, 1, 26] and `lex` is unchanged. If `lex` was originally greater than 25, `arr` is [26, 1, 26] and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is greater than 25 after the if-else block, `arr` is [26, 26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` was originally between -25 and -1, `arr` is [1, 26, 26]. If `lex` was originally greater than -1, `arr` is [26, 26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`.**

In simpler terms: The array `arr` now has an additional element `26` appended to it, making its length 3. The values of `t`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `lex` remain unchanged as per the conditions specified.
