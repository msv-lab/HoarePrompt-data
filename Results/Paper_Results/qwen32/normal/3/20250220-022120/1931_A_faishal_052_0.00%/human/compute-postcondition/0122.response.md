Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally between 0 and 25, `arr` is [1, 1, 1] if `lex` <= 26, otherwise `arr` is [1, 1] and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` was originally greater than 25, `arr` is [26, 1, 1] if `lex` <= 26, otherwise `arr` is [26, 1] and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` was originally between -25 and -1, `arr` is [1, 26, 1] if `lex` <= 26, otherwise `arr` is [1, 26]. If `lex` was originally greater than -1 and less than 52, `arr` is [26, 26, 1] if `lex` <= 26, otherwise `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` is [26, 26] and `lex` is `lex - 26`. In all cases, `lex` is adjusted as described and `arr` is updated accordingly.**
