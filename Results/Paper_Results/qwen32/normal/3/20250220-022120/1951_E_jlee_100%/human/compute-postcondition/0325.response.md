Let's break down the given initial state to understand what will be printed by the `print` statement.

The initial state provides us with several variables and their states:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `string` is a newly input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string.
- `n` is greater than 0 (the length of the string `string`).
- `x` is the first character of the string `s[0]`.
- `j` is set to 0.
- `count` and `count2` are both set to 0.
- `done` is False.
- The condition `not done` is True.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`.

The `print` statement is simply:
```python
print(1)
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It directly prints the integer 1.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **1**
