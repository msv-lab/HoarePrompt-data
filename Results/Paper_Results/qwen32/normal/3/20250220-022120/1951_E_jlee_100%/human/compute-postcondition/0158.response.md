Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`; `done` is False; `count` and `count2` are the values after the last iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
