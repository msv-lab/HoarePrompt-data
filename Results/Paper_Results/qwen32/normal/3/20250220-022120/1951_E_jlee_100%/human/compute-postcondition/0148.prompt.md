Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`. If all characters in `s` are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), then the state of `done` is not specified unless `n` is equal to 1, in which case `done` remains False. If not all characters in `s` are the same (`s.count(x) != n`), and there is exactly one character in `s` that is not `x` (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), then if `n` is odd and the character at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` of `s` is not `x`, the state of `done` is not specified unless `n` is equal to 1, in which case `done` remains False. If `x` is equal to `s[-1]`, there is no change to the state of `done`. Additionally, either `n` is even, or `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is equal to `x`. If `s.count(x) != n - 1`, the state of `done` remains unchanged; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`. If `count` is greater than 0, `done` is set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count` or if `count2` equals `count` and `count` is greater than 1 or if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is 0, `done` and `count2` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `j + 1`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`. If `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j] != x`, and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to `count`, `count2` is set to 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True. Otherwise, if `s[j] == x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `done` or `count2` beyond the initial conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `j + 1`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to `j`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `count`. If `count` is greater than 0, additional checks are performed: if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, if `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True. If `count2` equals `count`, `count2` is set to 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True. If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count` is 0, no additional checks are performed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
