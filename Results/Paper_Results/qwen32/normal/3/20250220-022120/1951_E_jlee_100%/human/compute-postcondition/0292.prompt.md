Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`; `done` is False; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0. If `s.count(x) == n`, the program maintains the same state as described. If `s.count(x) == n - 1` and `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the program checks this condition. Otherwise, the program maintains the same state as described.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string and must have at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is `s[0]`. If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is less than `count`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count` was equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0. If `count` was greater than 1, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `s[j]` remains `x`. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count2` or `done`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string and must have at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is `s[0]`. If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is incremented by 1 each time `s[j]` is equal to `x`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is set to True, and the loop is broken out of. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and the loop is broken out of. If `count` equals 1, `count2` is reset to 0 after it is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`. If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True after `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True and the loop is broken out of. If `count` is not greater than 0, `count` is set to `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string and must have at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `j + 1`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or `count < 1`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `count > 0`, additional checks and updates are performed: if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, `count` is set to `j`. If `s[j] != x`, `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j] == x`. If `count2 < count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2 == count`, `count2` is set to 0 if `count <= 1`. If `count2 > count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of all variables remain unchanged. If `count <= 0`, no additional checks or updates are performed on `count2` or `done`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
