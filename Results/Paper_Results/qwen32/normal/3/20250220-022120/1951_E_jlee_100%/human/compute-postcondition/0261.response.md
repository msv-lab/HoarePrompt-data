To determine what will be printed by the `print(string)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. **`i`**: An integer initialized to 1.
3. **`string`**: The newly input string.
4. **`s`**: A list of characters from the newly input string, with at least 1 character.
5. **`n`**: The length of `s`, which is at least 1.
6. **`x`**: The first element of `s`, i.e., `s[0]`.
7. **`j`**: Incremented by 1, but its initial value is not specified.

### Analysis:
The `print(string)` statement will output the value of the `string` variable. According to the initial state, `string` is described as "the newly input string." This means that the exact content of `string` is not provided in the initial state, but we know it is a string that has been input into the program.

### Conclusion:
The `print(string)` statement will output the newly input string.

### Final Output:
Output: **string (where string is the newly input string)**
