Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. **`i`**: Initialized to 0.
3. **`string`**: The input string.
4. **`s`**: A list of characters from `string`.
5. **`n`**: The length of `s`.
6. **`x`**: The first character of `s`.
7. **Count of `x` in `s`**: `n - 1`, meaning there is exactly one character in `s` that is not `x`.
8. **`n` is odd**: This implies that there is a unique middle character in `s`.
9. **Character at middle index `(n - 1) // 2`**: This character is not `x`.
10. **`done`**: The state of `done` is not explicitly mentioned unless `n` is equal to 1, in which case `done` remains False. If `x` is equal to `s[-1]`, there is no change to the state of `done`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement `print('NO')` directly outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state. There are no variables or conditions in the print statement itself that would alter the output.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
