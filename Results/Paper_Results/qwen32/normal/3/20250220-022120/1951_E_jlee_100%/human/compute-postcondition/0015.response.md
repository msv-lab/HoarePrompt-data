The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in the given context, there is no loop structure present, so the `continue` statement does not affect any of the variables or the flow of the program. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `done`) are altered.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`. The first character `x` of `s` is not equal to the last character `s[-1]`. The state of `done` is not specified unless `n` is equal to 1, in which case `done` remains False.**
