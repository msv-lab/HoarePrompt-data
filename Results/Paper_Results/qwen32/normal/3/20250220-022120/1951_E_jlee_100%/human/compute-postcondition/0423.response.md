The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration in a loop. Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, none of the variables (`t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count2`, `count`, `done`) are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is greater than 4; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is 4; `count2` is 0; `count` is 4. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, and `count2` remain unchanged.**
