To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Variables and Initial State**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases (irrelevant to the current print statement).
   - `i`: Current test case number, initialized to 1.
   - `string`: The newly input string.
   - `s`: A list of characters from the `string`.
   - `n`: Length of `s`, which is at least 1.
   - `x`: The first character of `s`, i.e., `s[0]`.
   - `j`: An index in the string `s` where `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
   - `done`: A boolean flag that is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise False.
   - `count` and `count2`: Integers where `count2` is greater than `count`.

2. **Key Points**:
   - `s[j]` is not equal to `x` (the first character of the string).
   - The print statement is `print(string[:j], string[j:])`, which splits the string into two parts at index `j`.

3. **Output Analysis**:
   - `string[:j]`: This part of the string includes all characters from the start of the string up to, but not including, the character at index `j`.
   - `string[j:]`: This part of the string includes all characters from index `j` to the end of the string.

Since the exact value of `j` and the string `string` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **string[:j], string[j:] (where string[:j] is the substring from the start of the string up to, but not including, the character at index j, and string[j:] is the substring from index j to the end of the string)**
