The code snippet calculates the length of the list `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `string`, and `s`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`.**
