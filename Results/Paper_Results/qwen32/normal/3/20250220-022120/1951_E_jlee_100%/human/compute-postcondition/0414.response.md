To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **`i`**: Set to 2.
3. **`string`**: A newly input string.
4. **`s`**: A list of characters from the `string`.
5. **`n`**: The length of `string`, and it is given that \(n > 4\).
6. **`x`**: The first character of `s`, i.e., `s[0]`.
7. **`j`**: Set to 4.
8. **`count2`**: A non-negative integer.
9. **`count`**: Set to 4.
10. **Condition**: If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.

### Code Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Explanation:
- `string[:j]`: This slices the string from the beginning up to, but not including, the 4th index. Therefore, it will print the first 4 characters of the string.
- `string[j:]`: This slices the string from the 4th index to the end. Therefore, it will print the rest of the string starting from the 5th character.

### Output:
Given the initial state, the print statement will output the first 4 characters of the string and the rest of the string starting from the 5th character.

Output: **first 4 characters of the string, rest of the string starting from the 5th character (where the string is the newly input string)**

Since the exact string is not provided, we can't determine the exact characters, but we can describe the output format precisely based on the given information.

Output: **string[:4], string[4:] (where string is the newly input string)**
