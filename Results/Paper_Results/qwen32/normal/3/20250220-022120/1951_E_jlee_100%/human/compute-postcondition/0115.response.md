Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `i` is initialized to 0.
3. `string` is the input string.
4. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
5. `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
6. `x` is `s[0]`.
7. `j` is `j + 1`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('YES')`.
- This statement directly prints the string `'YES'` to the standard output.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, and `j` because the print statement is not dependent on any of these variables.

### Final Answer:
Output: **YES**
