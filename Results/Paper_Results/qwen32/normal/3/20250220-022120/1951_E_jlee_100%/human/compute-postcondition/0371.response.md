To determine what will be printed by the `print(string)` statement, we need to understand the context provided by the initial state.

The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the key point here is the `string` variable. The description states that `string` is "the newly input string," which indicates that its value is determined by the input provided to the program at runtime. 

Given this information, the `print(string)` statement will output the value of the `string` variable, which is the newly input string.

Since the exact value of the `string` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it as the newly input string.

Output: **string (where string is the newly input string)**
