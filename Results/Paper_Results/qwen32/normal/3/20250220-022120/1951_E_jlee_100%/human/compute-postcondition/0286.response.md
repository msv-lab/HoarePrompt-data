Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string and must have at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `j + 1`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or `count < 1`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged; `count` is set to `j` if `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of all variables remain unchanged.**
