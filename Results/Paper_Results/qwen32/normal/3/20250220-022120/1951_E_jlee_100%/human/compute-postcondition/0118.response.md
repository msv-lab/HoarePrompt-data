The code snippet provided assigns the value `True` to the variable `done`. No other variables in the initial state are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `j + 1`; `done` is True.**
