You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    t = int(input())

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it determines whether it is possible to split the string into two non-empty parts such that the resulting parts are not palindromes and prints 'YES' along with the split positions if possible, otherwise prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze its logic step-by-step against the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap
- **Input:** A string `s` of lowercase Latin characters.
- **Output:** Determine if the string can be partitioned into substrings where each substring is not a palindrome. If possible, output "YES", the number of parts `k`, and the partitioned substrings. Otherwise, output "NO".
- **Constraints:** Multiple test cases, each string length up to 10^6, total length of all strings up to 10^6.

### Program Analysis
1. **Basic Checks:**
   - If the string length `n` is 1, it's a palindrome, so the output is "NO".
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different, the string itself is not a palindrome, so the output is "YES" with the string as the single partition.
   - If the string consists of the same character repeated `n` times, it's a palindrome, so the output is "NO".
   - If the string consists of the same character repeated `n-1` times, and the middle character (if `n` is odd) is different, the string is a palindrome, so the output is "NO".

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the string to check if any substring is not a palindrome.
   - It looks for the first character `x` that is different from the first character `s[0]`.
   - If such a character is found, it tries to create a partition around this character.
   - If the entire string is a palindrome, the program will not find any non-palindromic substrings and will output "NO".

### Detailed Steps
- **Single Character Check:** Correctly identifies strings of length 1 as palindromes.
- **First and Last Character Check:** Correctly identifies strings where the first and last characters are different as non-palindromes.
- **Uniform Character Check:** Correctly identifies strings with all identical characters as palindromes.
- **Middle Character Check:** Correctly identifies strings with `n-1` identical characters and one different middle character as palindromes.
- **Iterative Check:** The main loop checks for non-palindromic substrings by comparing characters from the start and end towards the center. If a mismatch is found, it outputs "YES" with the string as the single partition.
- **Partitioning Logic:** The program attempts to partition the string into two parts if possible, but this logic is flawed:
  - It uses conditions that do not guarantee non-palindromic partitions.
  - For example, if the string is `"aaaabaa"`, the program might incorrectly partition it into `"aaaa"` and `"baa"`, where `"aaaa"` is a palindrome.

### Flawed Logic Example
Consider the input `"aaaabaa"`:
- The program will find the first non-matching character at index 4 (`'b'`).
- It will then consider partitions like `"aaaa"` and `"baa"`, but `"aaaa"` is a palindrome, so this partition is invalid.

### Correctness
Given the flawed logic in the partitioning step, the program does not always output a valid partition when one exists. For example, it might incorrectly output "NO" for strings that can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect due to the flawed partitioning logic.

Correctness: **False**
