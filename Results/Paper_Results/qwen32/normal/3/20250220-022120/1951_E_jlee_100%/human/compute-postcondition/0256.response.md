Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string and must have at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is `s[0]`. If `s[j] != x`, `done` is set to True if `count2` is less than `count`, and `count2` is incremented by 1 if `count` is greater than 0. If `s[j] == x`, `count2` is incremented by 1 if `count` is greater than 0. `j` is incremented by 1. If `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and the loop is broken out of. If `count` equals 1, `count2` is set to 0 after `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j] != x` and `count2` is less than `count`. If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True and the loop is broken out of after `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j] != x` and `count2` is less than `count`. If `count` is not greater than 0, `count` is set to `j` if `s[j] != x` and `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True and the loop is broken out of.**
