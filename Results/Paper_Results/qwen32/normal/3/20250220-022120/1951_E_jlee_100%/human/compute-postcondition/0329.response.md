Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is now 0; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and `not done` is false. Otherwise, `done` remains False.**
