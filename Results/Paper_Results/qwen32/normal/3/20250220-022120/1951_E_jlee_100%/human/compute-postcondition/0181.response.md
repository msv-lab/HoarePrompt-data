Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `string` is a newly input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from the string `string` and must have at least 1 character.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 1.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s` (i.e., `s[0]`).
- `done` is a boolean variable set to `False`.
- `count` is an integer set to 0.
- `count2` is an integer set to 0.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` (indicating that the string `s` is not a palindrome).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, and the condition `s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]` do not influence the output of this specific print statement. The statement is independent of these variables and conditions.

### Output:
The output of the `print(1)` statement is the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
