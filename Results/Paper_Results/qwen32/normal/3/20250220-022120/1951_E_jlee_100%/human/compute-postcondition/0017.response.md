Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is `s[0]`. The count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n`, meaning all characters in `s` are the same. If `x` is not equal to `s[-1]`, the state of `done` is not specified unless `n` is equal to 1, in which case `done` remains False. If `x` is equal to `s[-1]`, there is no change to the state of `done`.**
