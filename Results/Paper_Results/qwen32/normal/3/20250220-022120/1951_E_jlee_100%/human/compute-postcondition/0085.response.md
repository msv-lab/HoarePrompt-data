The code provided contains a `break` statement, which will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed within. However, based on the given initial state, there is no loop or if statement explicitly mentioned that the `break` statement would affect. Therefore, the values of the variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is `j + 1`; `done` is True.**
