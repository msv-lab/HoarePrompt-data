The provided code snippet contains a simple `print(2)` statement. This statement will output the integer `2` regardless of the values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `done`, `count`, and `count2`) described in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print(2)` statement explicitly outputs the integer `2`.
- None of the other variables in the initial state are used in this print statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
