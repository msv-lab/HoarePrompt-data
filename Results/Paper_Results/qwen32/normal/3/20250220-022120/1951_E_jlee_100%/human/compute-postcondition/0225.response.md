To determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement executes, let's analyze the given initial state and the logical flow implied by the description.

The provided description outlines the state of several variables and conditions, but it does not explicitly show any conditional logic that would prevent the `print('YES')` statement from executing. Here's a breakdown of the relevant parts:

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `string` is a newly input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from the `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `count` and `count2` are not explicitly initialized but are used in conditions.
- `done` is a boolean variable that can be set to True under certain conditions.
- `j` is an index variable that gets incremented.

The description provides a set of conditions and actions that could modify `count2` and `done`, but these conditions do not seem to affect the execution of the `print('YES')` statement directly unless there is an unmet condition that would halt the program before reaching the print statement.

Since the `print('YES')` statement is not inside any conditional block that could prevent its execution based on the given description, it will execute and print "YES".

Output: **YES**
