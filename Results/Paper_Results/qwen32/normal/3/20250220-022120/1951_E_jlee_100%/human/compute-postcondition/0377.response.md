Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is 3; `count2` is greater than or equal to 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to 3. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
