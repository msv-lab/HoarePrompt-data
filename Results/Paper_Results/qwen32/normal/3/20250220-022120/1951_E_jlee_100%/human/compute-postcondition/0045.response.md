Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 0; `string` is the input string; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`. The state of `done` may be set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` within the loop. Otherwise, `count` and `done` remain unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes the changes to `count` and `done` based on the condition `s[j] != x and count < 1`. If the condition is met, `count` is updated to `j`, and `done` may be set to True under certain conditions within the loop. If the condition is not met, neither `count` nor `done` is altered.
