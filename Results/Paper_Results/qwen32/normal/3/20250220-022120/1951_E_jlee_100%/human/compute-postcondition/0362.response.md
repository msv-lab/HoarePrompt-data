Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 2; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string; `n` is greater than 0; `x` is `s[0]`; `j` is 0; `count` is greater than 0; `count2` is not less than `count`. If `count2` equals `count`, then `done` is True and if `count` is greater than 1, `count2` remains equal to `count`; otherwise, `count` is set to 1 and `count2` is set to 0. If `count2` is not equal to `count`, then `done` is True if `count2` is greater than `count`, otherwise `done` remains False.**
