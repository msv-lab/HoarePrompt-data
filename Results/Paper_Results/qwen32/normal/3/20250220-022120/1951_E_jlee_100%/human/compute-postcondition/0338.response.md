Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is set to 2.
   - `string` is the newly input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `x` is `s[0]` (the first character of the string `s`).
   - `j` is 0.
   - `count` is greater than 0.
   - `count2` is less than `count`.
   - `done` remains False.
   - The current character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(2)
   ```

The print statement is explicitly printing the integer `2`. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, `count2`, `done`) are used in the print statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is simply the integer `2`.

**Output:**
Output: **2**
