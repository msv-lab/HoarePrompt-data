Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `i` is 1; `string` is the newly input string; `s` is a list of characters from the newly input string and must have at least 1 character; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is `s[0]`; `done` is True; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, and `done` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
