Postcondition: **`q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 100, and for each of the `q` test cases, there are two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 <= `x` < `n` <= 10^9; `M` is an empty list; `w` is the square root of `q`, and `w` is an integer (i.e., `w == w // 1`). Additionally, `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
