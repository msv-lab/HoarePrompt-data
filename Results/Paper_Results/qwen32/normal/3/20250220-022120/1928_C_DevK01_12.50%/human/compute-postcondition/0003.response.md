The code snippet appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. The values of `q`, `n`, `x`, and the condition that `w` is the integer square root of `q` and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 100, `n` and `x` are integers for each of the `q` test cases with 1 <= `x` < `n` <= 10^9, `M` is a list containing the integer `w`, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and `w` is an integer, `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
