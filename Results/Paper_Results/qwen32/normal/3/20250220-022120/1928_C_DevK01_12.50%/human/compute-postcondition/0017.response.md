Output State: **`q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 100, `n` and `x` are integers for each of the `q` test cases with 1 <= `x` < `n` <= 10^9, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and `w` must be at least 2. `M` is a list that now includes `q // i` in addition to its previous elements. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `i` >= `x - 1`, `M` includes the integer `i`.**

In natural language: The list `M` now includes the integer `q // i` as an additional element. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`q`, `n`, `x`, `w`) remain unchanged. If `i` is now greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` will also include the integer `i`.
