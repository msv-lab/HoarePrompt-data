The code calculates the square root of `q` and assigns it to the variable `w`. The values of `q`, `n`, `x`, and `M` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 100, and for each of the `q` test cases, there are two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 <= `x` < `n` <= 10^9; `M` is an empty list; `w` is the square root of `q`.**
