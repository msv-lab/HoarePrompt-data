The function accepts an integer `q` and an integer `x`. It returns a list `M` containing the integer square root of `q` if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, along with all divisors `i` of `q` such that `1 <= i < w` and `i >= x - 1`, and all divisors `q // i` of `q` such that `1 <= i < w` and `q // i >= x - 1`.
