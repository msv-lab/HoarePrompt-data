Postcondition: **`q` is an integer such that 1 <= `q` <= 100, `n` and `x` are integers for each of the `q` test cases with 1 <= `x` < `n` <= 10^9, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and `w` must be at least 2. `M` is a list that may include `q // i` if `q // i` >= `x - 1`, in addition to its previous elements. If `q // i` >= `x - 1`, then `M` includes the new element `q // i`. If `i` >= `x - 1`, then `M` includes the new element `i`. If `q % i == 0` and `i` >= `x - 1`, `M` also includes the integer `i`. `i` is `i + 1` in both cases.**
