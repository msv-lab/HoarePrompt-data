The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and assigns this list to the variable `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The values of `t`, `cases`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1; `na_frente` and `pos_final` are integers obtained from the input; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
