The code snippet `pos_final -= 1` decrements the value of `pos_final` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input. After the operation, `pos_final` will be one less than its original value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from `na_frente` to 0, and `best` is the smallest total cost encountered that includes the cost of switching at a position less than or equal to `pos_final`, `c` is the next integer in the range(cases)**.
