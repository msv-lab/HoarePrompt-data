The code snippet provided initializes the variable `total` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `cases`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is 0.**
