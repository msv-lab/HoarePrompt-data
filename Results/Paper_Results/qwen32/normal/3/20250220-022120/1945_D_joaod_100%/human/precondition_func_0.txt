t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a list of n integers where each element b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
