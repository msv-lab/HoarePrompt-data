The code snippet `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` adds the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to the current value of `total`. Therefore, the value of `total` will be updated to reflect this addition. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
