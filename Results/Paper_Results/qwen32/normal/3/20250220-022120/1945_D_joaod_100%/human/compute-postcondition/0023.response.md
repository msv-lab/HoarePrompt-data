The code snippet increments the `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the new value of `total` is the sum of its previous value (which was 0) and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `na_frente` is 1, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**
