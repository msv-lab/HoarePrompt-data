Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is equal to `cases`, and the loop has processed all `cases` test cases. Each test case has computed and printed the minimum total cost (`best`) required to reach the final position from the starting position, considering the costs of switching and passing at each position.**

In simpler terms: After all the iterations, the loop has finished processing all the test cases specified by `cases`. For each test case, it calculated and printed the lowest total cost needed to reach the final position, either by switching or passing at each position along the way. The variable `c` will be equal to `cases`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables like `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's execution.
