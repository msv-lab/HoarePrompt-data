You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum total cost required to reach position `m` from position `1`, considering the costs specified in lists `a` (for switching) and `b` (for passing) at each position.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue of `n` people. Kirill can swap places with people in front of him, and each swap incurs a cost. The cost includes a swap fee for the person he swaps with and a passing fee for all people between them.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of people in the queue (`na_frente`), and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`).
2. Reads the swap fees (`custo_pra_trocar_a`).
3. Reads the passing fees (`custo_pra_passar_b`).
4. Initializes `total` to `0` and `best` to a very large value.
5. Iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning, updating `total` and `best` based on the costs.

#### Key Points in the Program:
- `na_frente` and `pos_final` are decremented by 1 to convert them to 0-based indexing.
- The loop iterates from the last person in the queue to the first.
- For each person, if they are within the `pos_final` range, it updates `best` if the current total cost plus the swap fee is less than the current `best`.
- It adds the minimum of the swap fee and passing fee to `total` for each person.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that adding the minimum of the swap fee and passing fee for each person will lead to the minimum total cost. However, this approach does not consider the optimal sequence of swaps and passes needed to reach the desired position.
   - The program does not account for the fact that passing fees accumulate differently based on the sequence of swaps and passes.

2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The logic of updating `best` and `total` does not correctly reflect the problem constraints. It incorrectly assumes that the best cost can be determined by simply adding the minimum of swap and pass fees for each person.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy that takes into account the sequence of swaps and passes needed to reach the desired position with the minimum cost.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to the incorrect logic and cost calculation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
