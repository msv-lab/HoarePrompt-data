Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` in `arr` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function returns 'Alice' if Alice wins the game, otherwise it returns 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the game's outcome for each test case.**
