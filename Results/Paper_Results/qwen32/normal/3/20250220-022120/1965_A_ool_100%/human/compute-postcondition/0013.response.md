The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the length of `set_`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile.
- `A` is True.
- `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1, and `set_` must contain at least one more unique element (e.g., `set_` could be [1, 2]).
- `not_c` is False if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `not_c` remains True.
- The loop variable `i` is currently at some value where `1 ≤ i < len(set_)`.

To execute the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The length of `set_` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

State at the start of the next iteration:
- `arr` remains the same.
- `A` remains True.
- `set_` remains the same.
- `not_c` remains the same (it will be recalculated within the loop body based on the new value of `i`).
- `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile; `A` is True; `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1, and `set_` must contain at least one more unique element (e.g., `set_` could be [1, 2]); `not_c` is False if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `not_c` remains True; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Given the previous iteration had `i` at some value, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile; `A` is True; `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1, and `set_` must contain at least one more unique element (e.g., `set_` could be [1, 2]); `not_c` is False if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `not_c` remains True; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile; `A` is True; `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1, and `set_` must contain at least one more unique element (e.g., `set_` could be [1, 2]); `not_c` is False if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `not_c` remains True; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 2.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile; `A` is True; `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1, and `set_` must contain at least one more unique element (e.g., `set_` could be [1, 2]); `not_c` is False if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `not_c` remains True; `i` is 2**.
