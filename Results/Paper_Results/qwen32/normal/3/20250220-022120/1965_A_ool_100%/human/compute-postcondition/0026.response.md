Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. `A` is `False` if it was `True` and `True` if it was `False`. `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1. `not_c` is `True` if there are no differences greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`. `i` is `len(set_) - 1`. If `not_c` is `True`, `A` is toggled (i.e., `A` becomes `False` if it was `True` and `True` if it was `False`).**
