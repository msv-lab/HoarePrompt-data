The code snippet provided is simply `not_c = True`. This sets the variable `not_c` to the boolean value `True`. The other variables (`arr`, `A`, and `set_`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile; `A` is False; `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1; `not_c` is True**.
