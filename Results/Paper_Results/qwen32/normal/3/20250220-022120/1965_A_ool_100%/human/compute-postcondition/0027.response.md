Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine the returned value based on the conditions described.

The final line of the provided code snippet is:
```
return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `A` is a boolean value that has been toggled based on the condition of `not_c`.
- `not_c` is `True` if there are no differences greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`.
- `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1.

Since `set_` starts with 1 and contains unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and `not_c` checks for differences greater than 1 between consecutive elements, `not_c` being `True` implies that `set_` is a consecutive sequence starting from 1.

If `not_c` is `True`, `A` is toggled. However, the exact initial value of `A` is not specified, but its final value depends on the toggle operation. Regardless of the initial value, toggling `A` once will change its value from `True` to `False` or from `False` to `True`.

Since the exact initial value of `A` is not specified, we can only determine that `A` will be either `True` or `False` after the toggle operation. Given the return statement, if `A` is `True` after the toggle, the function returns `'Alice'`; if `A` is `False` after the toggle, the function returns `'Bob'`.

Thus, the output could be either `'Alice'` or `'Bob'`.

Output State: **The program returns 'Alice' or 'Bob'**.
