Functionality: **The function `func_1` determines the winner of a game based on the configuration of stone piles across multiple test cases. It accepts a list of integers where the first element represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of lines for each test case: the first line contains the number of piles, and the second line contains the number of stones in each pile. The function returns 'Alice' if Alice wins and 'Bob' if Bob wins.**
