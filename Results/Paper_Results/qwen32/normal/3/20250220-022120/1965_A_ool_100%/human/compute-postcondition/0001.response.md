The given code snippet creates a set from the list `arr` and then converts it back to a list, storing the result in `set_`. This operation removes any duplicate elements from `arr`.

Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where each pair consists of an integer `n` and `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The variable `A` is initially set to `False`.

After executing the code `set_ = list(set(arr))`, the list `set_` will contain unique elements from `arr`. The variable `arr` remains unchanged, and `A` is still `False`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of lines where the first line of each pair contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile; `A` is False; `set_` is a list containing unique elements from `arr`.**
