Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `s`; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `done` is False; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0; `i` is now the value that allows the loop to check the condition `i < t` again. If `n` equals 1, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Additionally, if `s.count(x) == n`, then the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string` with `n` being at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `i` is the value that allows the loop to check the condition `i < t` again; `count` is greater than 0 if the if condition was true; if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `done` is True and `count2` can be 0, greater than 0 and less than `count`, or equal to `count` if `count` is greater than 1; if `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `done` remains False and `count2` is set to 1. If the if condition was false, `count` remains unchanged and `done` and `count2` retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string` with `n` being at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `i` is the value that allows the loop to check the condition `i < t` again; `j` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains False and the loop continues. If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is equal to `x`, otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1 if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or `count2` remains unchanged if `count2` equals `count`, or the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `count2` is greater than `count`. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count2` based on the current `s[j]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string` with `n` being at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `i` is the value that allows the loop to check the condition `i < t` again; `j` is incremented by 1. If `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to `j` and `done` is set to True. If `count2 > 0` and `count2 < count`, no changes are made to the variables. If `count` is not greater than 1, `count2` is 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables. If `count` is not greater than 0, no additional changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
