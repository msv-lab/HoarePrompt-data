The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state and the variables described do not affect the output of this particular print statement. The variables `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, and `j` are mentioned, but they are not used within the `print('YES')` statement. Therefore, the output will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
