Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it receives a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. The function processes each string `s` and returns some output based on the content of each string.**
