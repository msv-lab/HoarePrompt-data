Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and must be less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
