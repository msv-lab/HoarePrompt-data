Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `string` is the user input, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `count2 > 0` and `count2 < count`, `done` is set to `True`. Otherwise, if `count2` equals `count`, `done` is set to `True` if `count` is greater than 1; if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `done` is set to `True`; if `count` is not greater than 1, `count2` is set to 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to `True`. In all cases, `count` is set to `j`.**
