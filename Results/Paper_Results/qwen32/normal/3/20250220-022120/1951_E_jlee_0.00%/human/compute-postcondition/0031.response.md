Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`, and if `n` is 1, `done` remains False; `x` is the first character of `string`. If all characters in `s` are the same as `x`, then `s.count(x) == n`. Otherwise, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then either `n` is even or the middle character of `s` (if `n` is odd) is equal to `x`.**
