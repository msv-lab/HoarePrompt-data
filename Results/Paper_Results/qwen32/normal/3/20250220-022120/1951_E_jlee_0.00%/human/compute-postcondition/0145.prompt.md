Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`, and if `n` is 1, `done` remains False; `x` is the first character of `string`. If all characters in `s` are the same as `x`, then `s.count(x) == n`. Otherwise, the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n`. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then either `n` is even or the middle character of `s` (if `n` is odd) is equal to `x`; `count` is 0; `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`. If `count` is greater than 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `count2` is updated such that `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is set to 1. The current value of `count` remains greater than 0. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count2` or `done`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1; `x` is the first character of `string`; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and must be less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `count` is greater than 0, the following conditions apply: if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is incremented by 1. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count2` equals `count`, `count2` is set to 0. If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `done`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `string` is the user input, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `count` is greater than 0, `count` is set to `j`. If `count` is not greater than 0, `done` is set to `True` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If `count2` is incremented by 1 and `count2 > 0` and `count2 < count`, `done` is set to `True`. If `count2` equals `count`, `done` is set to `True` if `count` is greater than 1; if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to `True`. If `count2` is not greater than `count` and `count` is not greater than 1, `count2` is set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
