You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    t = int(input())

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of strings, each from a separate test case, and determines whether it is possible to split the string into two non-empty parts such that the first part is not equal to the second part. For each string, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the split parts if such a split exists; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to partition a given string into substrings such that none of the substrings is a palindrome. If such a partition is possible, the program should output "YES", the number of parts, and the partition itself. If no such partition exists, it should output "NO".

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it tries to find a valid partition. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Single Character Strings**: If the string has only one character, it's a palindrome, so the program correctly outputs "NO".
2. **First and Last Character Check**: If the first and last characters are different, the entire string is not a palindrome, so the program outputs "YES" with the whole string as the partition.
3. **All Characters Same**: If all characters in the string are the same, it's impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings, so the program outputs "NO".
4. **All Characters Same Except One**: If all characters are the same except one, the program checks if the middle character (if the length is odd) is different from the others. If it is, it outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES" with the whole string as the partition.
5. **General Case**: For other cases, the program iterates through the first half of the string, checking for differences from the corresponding characters in the second half. If it finds a difference, it outputs "YES" with the whole string as the partition. If no differences are found, it looks for a valid partition of two parts. If it finds such a partition, it outputs "YES" with the partition. If no valid partition is found after checking, it outputs "NO".

### Issues in the Program
There are some issues in the program that could lead to incorrect results:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Palindrome Check**: The program checks for differences in the first and second halves of the string to determine if the string is a palindrome. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, the string "abacaba" is not a palindrome, but it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
2. **Incorrect Partitioning Logic**: The logic for partitioning the string into two parts is incorrect. The program does not correctly handle cases where a valid partition exists but the current logic does not find it.

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly handle all cases, especially the general case of partitioning a string into non-palindromic substrings. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
