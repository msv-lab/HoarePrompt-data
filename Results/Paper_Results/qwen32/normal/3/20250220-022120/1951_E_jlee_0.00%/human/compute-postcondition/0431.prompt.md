Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, each of the next `t` lines contains a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    string = input()
    s = list(string)
    n = len(s)
    done = False
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
        continue
    x = s[0]
    if x != s[-1]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        continue
    if s.count(x) == n:
        print('NO')
        continue
    elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
        if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
        continue
    count = 0
    count2 = 0
    for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
        if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            done = True
            break
        if s[j] != x and count < 1:
            count = j
        if count > 0:
            if s[j] != x:
                if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
                elif count2 == count:
                    if count > 1:
                        print('YES')
                        print(2)
                        print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                        done = True
                        break
                    else:
                        count2 = 0
                        continue
                elif count2 > count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
            else:
                count2 += 1
    if not done:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`; `x` is the first character of `string`; `done` is False; `count` and `count2` are updated based on the loop's logic; `done` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0; string is the new user input; s is a list of characters from the new string; n is the length of the new s; x is the first character of the new string; done is False; count is 0 or updated based on conditions; count2 is 0 or updated based on conditions; i is the value that allows the loop to check the condition i < t again; the current value of done is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0; string is the new user input; s is a list of characters from the new string; n is the length of the new s; x is the first character of the new string; if done is False, the string is not symmetric and i is i + 1; count and count2 retain their values from the last iteration. If done is True, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
