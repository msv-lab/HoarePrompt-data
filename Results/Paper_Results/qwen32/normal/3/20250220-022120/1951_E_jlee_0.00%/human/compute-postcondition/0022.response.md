Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s` and is odd; `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is not equal to `x`; `done` remains False if `n` is 1; `x` is the first character of `string`; the count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n - 1`.**
