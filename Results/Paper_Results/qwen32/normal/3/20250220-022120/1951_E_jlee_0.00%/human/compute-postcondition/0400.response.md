Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `string` is the new user input, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `string`, `j` is `j + 1`, `count` and `count2` retain their previous values. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` retains its previous value.**
