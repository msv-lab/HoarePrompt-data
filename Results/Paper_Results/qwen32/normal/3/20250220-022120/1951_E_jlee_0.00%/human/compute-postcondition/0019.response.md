The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect the execution in any way. Therefore, none of the variables are changed.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the user input; `s` is a list of characters from `string`; `n` is the length of `s`, and if `n` is 1, `done` remains False; `x` is the first character of `string`; all characters in `s` are the same as `x` (i.e., `s.count(x) == n`).**
