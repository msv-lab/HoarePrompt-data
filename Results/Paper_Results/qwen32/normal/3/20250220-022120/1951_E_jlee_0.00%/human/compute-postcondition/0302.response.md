Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is the length of the new `s`; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `done` is False; `count` is 0 or updated based on conditions; `count2` is 0 or updated based on conditions; `i` is `i + 1`.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their previous values.
