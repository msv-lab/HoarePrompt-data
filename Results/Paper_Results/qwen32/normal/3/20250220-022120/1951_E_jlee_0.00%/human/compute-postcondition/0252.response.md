Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string` with `n` being at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `i` is the value that allows the loop to check the condition `i < t` again; `j` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains False and the loop continues. If `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is incremented by 1 if `s[j]` is equal to `x`, otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1 if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or `count2` remains unchanged if `count2` equals `count`, or the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `count2` is greater than `count`. If `count` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `count2` based on the current `s[j]`.**
