Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `string` is the new user input.
3. `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
4. `n` is the length of the new `s`.
5. `x` is the first character of the new `string`.
6. `done` is False.
7. `count` is 0 or updated based on conditions.
8. `count2` is 0 or updated based on conditions.
9. `i` is `i + 1`. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the state remains as described.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward. It does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided to the `print` function.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
