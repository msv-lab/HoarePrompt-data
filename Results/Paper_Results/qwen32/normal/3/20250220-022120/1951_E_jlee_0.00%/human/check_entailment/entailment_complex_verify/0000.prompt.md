You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: t is 0; i is equal to the original value of t; all test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of strings, each from a separate test case, and determines whether it is possible to split the string into two non-empty parts such that the first part is not equal to the second part. For each string, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the split parts if such a split exists; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to partition strings that contain palindromic substrings into non-palindromic parts. Let's analyze a few cases:

### Case 1: Palindromic Substrings
Consider the input string "abccba". The program will incorrectly output "NO" because it only checks for the entire string being a palindrome, not for palindromic substrings within the string.

### Case 2: Strings with Repeated Characters
Consider the input string "abababa". The program might incorrectly output "NO" because it does not correctly identify that the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings such as "ab", "ab", "aba".

### Case 3: Strings with Mixed Patterns
Consider the input string "aabbaa". The program might incorrectly output "NO" because it does not correctly identify that the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings such as "aab", "baa" or "aa", "b", "baa".

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that each substring in the partition is not a palindrome. Here's a revised approach:

1. If the string length is 1, output "NO" because a single character is a palindrome.
2. If the string contains at least two different characters, output "YES" and partition the string into substrings of at least two characters that are not palindromes.
3. If the string consists of only one character repeated, output "NO".

Here's a correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        s = list(string)
        n = len(s)
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        if len(set(s)) == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        print('YES')
        # Partition the string into non-palindromic parts
        # For simplicity, we can partition it into pairs of characters
        # which are guaranteed to not be palindromic if there are at least two different characters
        parts = []
        j = 0
        while j < n:
            if j + 1 < n:
                parts.append(string[j:j+2])
                j += 2
            else:
                parts.append(string[j])
                j += 1
        print(len(parts))
        print(" ".join(parts))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This implementation ensures that the string is partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes, handling all edge cases correctly.
