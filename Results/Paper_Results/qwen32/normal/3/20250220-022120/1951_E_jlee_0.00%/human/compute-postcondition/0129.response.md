The code snippet assigns `True` to the variable `done`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `done` is explicitly set to `True` while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `string` is the user input, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `string`, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and must be less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `done` is `True`.**
