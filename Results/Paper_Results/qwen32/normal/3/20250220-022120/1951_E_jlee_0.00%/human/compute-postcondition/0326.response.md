Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `string` is the new user input; `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`; `n` is at least 1; `x` is the first character of the new `string`; `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`; `count2` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`. Otherwise, `count` retains its original value.**
