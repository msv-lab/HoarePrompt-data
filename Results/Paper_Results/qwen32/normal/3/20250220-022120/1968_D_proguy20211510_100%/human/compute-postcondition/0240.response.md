Postcondition: **`vis[pb - 1]` is 0, `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate, `ps` is the initial `ps`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing at least one element from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle, and `paths` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `a[ps - 1]`. Additionally, `k` is less than `i + 1`.**

This postcondition retains all the conditions stated in the precondition and includes the additional information from the if condition, specifying that `k` is less than `i + 1`.
