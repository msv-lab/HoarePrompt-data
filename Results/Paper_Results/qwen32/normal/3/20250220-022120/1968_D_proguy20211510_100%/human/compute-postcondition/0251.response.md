Output State: **`vis[pb - 1]` is 0, `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `resb` is `max(max(0, curr), curr)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate, `ps` is the initial `ps`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing at least one element from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle, `paths` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `a[ps - 1]`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In natural language: The value of `resb` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value (`max(0, curr)`) and the current value of `curr`. All other variables retain their previous values.
