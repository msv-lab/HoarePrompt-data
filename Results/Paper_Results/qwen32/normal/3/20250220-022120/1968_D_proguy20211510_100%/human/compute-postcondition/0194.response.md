The provided code snippet reads four values from the input and splits them into the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. The initial state does not mention these variables, so they are introduced by this code. The other variables (`resb`, `ress`, `preb`, `pres`, and `i_final`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`. If `resb` was originally greater than `ress`, `resb` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `resb` is updated to the value of `ress`. `n` is a string from the input, `k` is a string from the input, `pb` is a string from the input, `ps` is a string from the input.**
