The code initializes a list `vis` with `n` zeros. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(t \geq 1\); `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `pathb` is an empty list; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.**
