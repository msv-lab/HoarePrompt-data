Postcondition: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0]` to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `preb`, `resb`, `paths`, `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress` (before the final update), and `pres` (before the final update) remain unchanged. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `ress` is updated to the value of `resb`. Otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged.**
