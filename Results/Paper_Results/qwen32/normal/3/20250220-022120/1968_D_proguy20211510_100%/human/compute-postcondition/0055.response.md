The code snippet `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates the value of `resb` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `curr`. The values of `pathb`, `i`, `curr`, and `preb` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pathb` contains at least one element, `i` is 0, `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * k`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[0]`, `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr`.**
