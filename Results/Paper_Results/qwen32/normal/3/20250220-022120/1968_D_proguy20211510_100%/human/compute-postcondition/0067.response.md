The code snippet updates the value of `resb` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `curr`. The values of `pathb`, `i`, `preb`, and `curr` remain unchanged. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, but since the code provided does not include any conditional break statement, we assume it is not executed here. Therefore, the only change is in `resb`.

Output State: **`pathb` contains at least two elements, `i` is 2, `preb` is `preb + pathb[1] + pathb[i]`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `resb` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr`.**
