The code snippet `paths.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the element `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. This means that the list `paths` will now include the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end of it. The other variables remain unchanged unless `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, which is not the case here as per the initial state description, so no additional changes occur.

Output State: **`vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[ps - 1]` is 0; `pathb` contains the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` up to the current point; `pb` is the current value; `paths` includes `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. The element `a[ps - 1]` has been appended to `paths`.**
