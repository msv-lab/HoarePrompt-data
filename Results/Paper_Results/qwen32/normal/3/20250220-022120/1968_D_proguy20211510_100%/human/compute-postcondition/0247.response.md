Output State: **`vis[pb - 1]` is 0, `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `resb` is `max(0, curr)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate, `ps` is the initial `ps`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing at least one element from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle, `paths` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `a[ps - 1]`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables do not change except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
