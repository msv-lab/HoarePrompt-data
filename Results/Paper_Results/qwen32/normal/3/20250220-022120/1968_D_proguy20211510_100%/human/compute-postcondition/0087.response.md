The given code snippet updates the value of `ress` by taking the maximum of its current value and the value of `curr`. No other variables are modified by this statement. Therefore, the only change in the state is the updated value of `ress`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `paths` is a list with at least 2 elements, `preb` is the sum of `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` across all iterations, `vis`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `curr`, `pres` is `pres + 2 * paths[i]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
