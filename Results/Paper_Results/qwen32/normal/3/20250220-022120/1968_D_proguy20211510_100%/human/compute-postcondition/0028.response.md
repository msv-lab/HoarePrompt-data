Initial State: 
- The loop breaks when `vis[pb - 1] == 1`.
- `pathb` will contain the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` until the cycle is detected.
- `pb` will be the value that causes the cycle detection.
- `vis` will have `vis[pb - 1]` set to 1, indicating the node has been revisited.
- `vis` is initially a list of zeros with length `n`.

Given the code snippet:
```
vis = [0] * n
```

This line of code reinitializes the `vis` list to a list of zeros with length `n`. This means that all previous values in `vis` are reset to 0, and no nodes are marked as visited.

Output State: **`vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`; the loop breaks when `vis[pb - 1] == 1`; `pathb` will contain the sequence of elements `a[pb - 1]` until the cycle is detected; `pb` will be the value that causes the cycle detection.**

In natural language: The `vis` list is reset to a list of zeros with length `n`, meaning no nodes are marked as visited. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
