### Reasoning:
The provided Python program follows the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation**: For both players (Bodya and Sasha), the program calculates the path they will follow based on the permutation `p`. It starts from their respective starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` and continues moving to the next position according to the permutation until it encounters a cycle (i.e., a position it has already visited).

3. **Score Calculation**: For each player, the program calculates the maximum possible score they can achieve in `k` turns. It does this by considering all possible ways to stay or move in each turn and choosing the option that maximizes the score. The score is calculated by summing up the values from the array `a` at each position the player visits.

4. **Comparison and Output**: After calculating the scores for both players, the program compares them and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on which player has the higher score or if their scores are equal.

### Verification:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output requirements, calculates the paths and scores accurately, and makes the correct comparison to determine the winner.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

**Correctness: True**
