Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(t \geq 1\); `n`, `k`, and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`; `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1], a[pb - 1]`; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
