Output State: **`vis[pb - 1]` is 0, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the elements from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n`.**

The list `vis` has been reset to a list of zeros with length `n`, so all previously set values, including `vis[pb - 1]`, are now 0. All other variables retain their previous values.
