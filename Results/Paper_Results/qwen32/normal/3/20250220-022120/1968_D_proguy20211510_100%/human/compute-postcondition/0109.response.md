Postcondition: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0]` to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1, `preb`, `resb`, `ps`, `pb`, and `ress` remain unchanged, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, and `pb` is now `p[pb - 1]`.**

This postcondition retains all the conditions from the precondition and includes the fact that `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, which is the condition that must be true to enter the if statement.
