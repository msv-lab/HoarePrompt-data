The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `pathb`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop statement `for i in range(len(pathb))`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `pathb`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `pathb` contains at least one element.

To proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The state of `pathb` does not need to be changed as it remains the same throughout the loop.

State: **`pathb` contains at least one element, `i` is 1**
