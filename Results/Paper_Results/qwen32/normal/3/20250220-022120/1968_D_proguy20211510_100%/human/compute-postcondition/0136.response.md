Given that the `while` loop in the provided code is a `while True` loop, it is designed to execute indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered. Since there are no conditions in the loop head to check, the state at the end of the previous iteration does not need to be modified to ensure the loop executes one more time.

Therefore, the state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0]` to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[ps - 1]` which is 1, `preb`, `resb`, `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, `pb`, and `ress` remain unchanged, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `paths` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]` twice, `pathb` is a list containing all elements `a[pb - 1]` until a cycle is detected. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
