Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: resb is the maximum value of curr calculated during iterations, ress is 0, preb is the sum of all elements of pathb up to the point where k < i + 1, pres is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(paths)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
    pres += paths[i]
    ress = max(ress, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, curr)`, `preb` is the sum of all elements of `pathb` up to the point where `k < i + 1`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `paths` must have at least one element, and if `k` is less than `i + 1`, the loop or conditional block is exited. Otherwise, no change occurs regarding `k`. `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, curr)`, `preb` is the sum of all elements of `pathb` up to the point where `k < i + 1`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `paths` must have at least one element. If `k < i + 1`, the loop or conditional block is exited. Otherwise, no change occurs regarding `k`. `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, and `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, curr)`, `preb` is the sum of all elements of `pathb` up to the point where `k < i + 1`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `paths` must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
