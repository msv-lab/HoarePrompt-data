The code snippet reassigns the variable `vis` to a new list of `n` zeros, effectively resetting all the values in `vis` to zero. This means that the previous state where `vis` was a list of `n` zeros except `vis[pb - 1]` which was 1, is now overridden.

All other variables (`i`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `ps`, `pb`, `ress`, `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `paths`, and `pathb`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0] to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, `preb`, `resb`, `ps`, `pb`, and `ress` remain unchanged, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input, `paths` is an empty list, `pathb` is a list containing all elements `a[pb - 1]` until a cycle is detected.**
