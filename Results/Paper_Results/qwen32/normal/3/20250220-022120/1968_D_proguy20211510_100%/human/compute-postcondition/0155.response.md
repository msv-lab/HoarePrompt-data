The code snippet `preb += pathb[i]` increments the value of `preb` by the value of `pathb[i]`. This means the new value of `preb` will be the sum of its previous value and `pathb[i]`.

The other variables (`resb`, `ress`, `pres`, `pathb`, `curr`, `i`) remain unchanged by this operation. The condition `if k < i + 1` and its implications (breaking out of a loop or if statement) are also not affected by this single line of code.

Output State: **`resb` is `max(0, preb + pathb[i] * (k - i))`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i] + pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list with at least one element, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
