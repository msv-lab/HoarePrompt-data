Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, a list `p` of `n` integers, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a value based on the provided inputs for each test case. Specifically, if the conditions related to `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` are met, it returns a specific result for that test case.**
