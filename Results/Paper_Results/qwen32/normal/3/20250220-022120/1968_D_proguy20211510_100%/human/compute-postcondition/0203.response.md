The code snippet `pb = p[pb - 1]` updates the value of `pb` to be the element at the index `pb - 1` in the list `p`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's break it down:
- The initial value of `pb` is an integer.
- The new value of `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, which means `pb` is now the value located at the index `pb - 1` in the list `p`.

Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during all iterations, `preb` is unchanged, `pres` is the sum of the first `i_final + 1` elements of `paths`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1.**
