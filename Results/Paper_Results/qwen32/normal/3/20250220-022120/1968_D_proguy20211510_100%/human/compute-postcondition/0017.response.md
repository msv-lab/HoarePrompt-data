Given the `while True` loop, the loop will continue to execute indefinitely as long as the program does not encounter a `break` statement or some other mechanism to exit the loop. Therefore, the state of the program does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(t \geq 1\); `n`, `k`, and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`; `pathb` is a list containing the single element `a[pb - 1]`; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1.**
