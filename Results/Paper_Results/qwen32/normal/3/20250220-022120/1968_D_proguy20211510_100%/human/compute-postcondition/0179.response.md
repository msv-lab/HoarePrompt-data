Postcondition: **`resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, curr)`, `preb` is the sum of all elements of `pathb` up to the point where `k < i + 1`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, `paths` must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
