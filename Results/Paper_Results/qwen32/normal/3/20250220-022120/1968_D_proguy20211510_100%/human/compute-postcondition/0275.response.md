Output State: **`vis[pb - 1]` is 0, `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, curr)`, `preb` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `pathb` where `i` is the number of iterations completed, `pres` is `pres + a[ps - 1]`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate, `ps` is the initial `ps`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the elements from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle, `paths` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `a[ps - 1]`, `curr` is `pres + paths[2] * (k - 2)`, `i` is 2. If `k < 3`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Natural Language: The value of `curr` has been updated to `pres + paths[2] * (k - 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
