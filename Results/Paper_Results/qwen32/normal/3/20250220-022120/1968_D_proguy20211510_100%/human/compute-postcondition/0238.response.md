Output State: **`vis[pb - 1]` is 0, `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the index that causes the loop to terminate, `ps` is the initial `ps`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `pathb` is a list containing the elements from `a` corresponding to the indices in the cycle, and `paths` is a list containing three elements, all equal to `a[ps - 1]`.**

Explanation: The values of `preb` and `pres` are both set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
