The code `preb += pathb[i]` updates the value of `preb` by adding `pathb[i]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the value of `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[i]`. This means the new value of `preb` is the sum of its previous value and `pathb[i]`.

Output State: **`resb` is `max(resb, curr)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i] + pathb[i] + pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list with at least one element, `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `k < i + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simpler terms, `preb` is now `preb + pathb[i] + pathb[i] + pathb[i]`, and all other variables retain their previous values.
