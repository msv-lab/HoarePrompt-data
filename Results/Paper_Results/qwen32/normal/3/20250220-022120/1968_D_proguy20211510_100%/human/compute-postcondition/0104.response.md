Output State: **`i` is `min(len(paths), k)`, `pres` is the sum of `paths[0]` to `paths[min(len(paths), k) - 1]`, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, `preb`, `resb`, `ps`, `pb`, and `ress` remain unchanged. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `ress` is updated to the value of `resb`. Otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged. `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers. `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained from the input. `pathb` is an empty list. `paths` is an empty list.**

In natural language: The variable `vis` is now a list containing `n` zeros. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
