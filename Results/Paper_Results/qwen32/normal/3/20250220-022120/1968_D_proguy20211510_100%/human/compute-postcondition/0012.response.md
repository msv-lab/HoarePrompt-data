The code snippet `pathb.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the element at index `pb - 1` from the list `a` to the list `pathb`. 

Given the initial state, `pathb` was an empty list. After executing the code, `pathb` will contain one element, which is `a[pb - 1]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `paths`, and `vis` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(t \geq 1\); `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `pathb` is a list containing the single element `a[pb - 1]`; `paths` is an empty list; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros except `vis[pb - 1]` which is 1.**
