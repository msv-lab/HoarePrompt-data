The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`. The execution of the loop depends on the string `s` having at least one character, which is already guaranteed by the problem statement. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. 

However, according to the task instructions, we need to specify the state of objects in the loop head before the loop starts. Since `j` is the loop variable and will be assigned the first character of `s` in the first iteration, we can set `j` to the first character of `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is 0, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the first character of `s`**
