The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, which iterates over the string `s` in reverse order. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `j` to the next character in the reversed string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'
- `ma` is `n - 1` if the current character `j` is 'B', otherwise `ma` remains 0
- `mi` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in `s`
- `m` is the number of test cases
- `c` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in `s`
- `d` is 1
- `l` is an empty list
- If the current character `j` is 'B', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement

The loop iterates over `s[::-1]`, which means it starts from the last character of `s` and moves towards the first character. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the current character being processed. To start the next iteration, `j` should be the previous character in the reversed string.

Let's denote the current position of `j` in the reversed string as `pos`. If `j` was the character at position `pos` in the reversed string, then in the next iteration, `j` should be the character at position `pos + 1`.

However, since we don't have the exact position of `j` in the reversed string, we can only describe the state in terms of the next character in the reversed string.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `ma` is `n - 1` if the current character `j` is 'B', otherwise `ma` remains 0, `mi` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in `s`, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is 1, and `l` is an empty list. `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`**
