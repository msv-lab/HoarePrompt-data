Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `ma` is `n - 1` if the current character `j` is 'B', otherwise `ma` remains 0, `mi` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in `s`, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is 1, and `l` is an empty list. If the current character `j` is 'B', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
