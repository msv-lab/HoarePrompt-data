The code snippet `mi = c` assigns the value of `c` to `mi`. Given that `c` is 2, `mi` will now be 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0, `mi` is 2, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is 2, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the second character of `s`. If `j` is 'B', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
