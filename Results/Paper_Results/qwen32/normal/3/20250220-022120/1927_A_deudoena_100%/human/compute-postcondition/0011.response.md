The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the first character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the next character in `s` will be the second character. Therefore, `j` should be updated to the second character of `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0, `mi` is 1 if `j` is 'B', otherwise `mi` remains 0, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is 1, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the second character of `s`. If `j` is 'B', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
