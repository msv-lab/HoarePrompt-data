Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0, `mi` is 2, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is 2, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the second character of `s`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values, and the only change is the flow of control due to the `break` statement.
