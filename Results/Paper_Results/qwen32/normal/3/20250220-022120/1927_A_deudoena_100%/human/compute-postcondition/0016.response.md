The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and the current character `j`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the second character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Given that `s` is a string of length `n` and `j` is currently the second character, the next character in the string `s` would be the third character, assuming `n` is at least 3. If `n` is exactly 2, the loop would terminate after the second iteration.

To generalize, if `j` is currently the second character, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be the third character of `s`. 

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0, `mi` is 2 if the second character of `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` remains 0, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is 2, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and `j` is the third character of `s`. If `j` is 'B', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
