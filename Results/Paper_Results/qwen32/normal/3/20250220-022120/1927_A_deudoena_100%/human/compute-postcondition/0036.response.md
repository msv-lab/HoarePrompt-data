Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `mi` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in `s`, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is 3, `l` is an empty list, `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s`, `ma` is `n - 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
