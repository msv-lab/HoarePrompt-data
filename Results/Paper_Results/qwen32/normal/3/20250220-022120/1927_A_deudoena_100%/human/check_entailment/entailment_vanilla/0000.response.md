Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make all cells in the strip white. The strip is represented by a string of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters.

### Key Points:
1. We need to find the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string.
2. The minimum length of the segment to paint white is the distance between these two 'B's plus one (since the segment is inclusive).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program defines a function `func_1()` that is supposed to compute the minimum length of the segment to paint white. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the function does:
1. It initializes `ma` and `mi` to 0. These are meant to store the indices of the last and first 'B' respectively.
2. It reads the length of the strip `m` and the strip itself `s`.
3. It then iterates through the string `s` to find the first occurrence of 'B'. When it finds the first 'B', it sets `mi` to the current index (1-based) and breaks the loop.
4. It then iterates through the reversed string `s[::-1]` to find the last occurrence of 'B'. When it finds the last 'B', it sets `ma` to the length of the string minus the current index (1-based) and breaks the loop.
5. Finally, it returns `ma - mi + 2`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. The program uses 1-based indexing for `mi` and `ma`, which is not a problem in itself but can be confusing.
2. The return statement `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `ma - mi + 1` because the segment is inclusive. Adding 2 would overestimate the length of the segment by one.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation in the return statement.

### Correctness: **False**

Hence, the final answer is:
Correctness: **False**
