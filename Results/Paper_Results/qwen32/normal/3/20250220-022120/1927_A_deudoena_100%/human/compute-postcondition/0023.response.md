The value of `d` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `ma`, `mi`, `m`, `c`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), `s` is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `ma` is 0, `mi` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in `s`, `m` is the number of test cases, `c` is the 1-based index of the first 'B' in `s`, `d` is 1, and `l` is an empty list.**
