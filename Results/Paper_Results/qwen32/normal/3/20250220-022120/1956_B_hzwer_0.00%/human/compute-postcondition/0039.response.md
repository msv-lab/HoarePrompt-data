Postcondition: **The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. Specifically, if the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is `0`, `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is equal to `dp[n - 2][n - 1]`. Otherwise, `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is updated to `max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1)` if the count is `1`, or to `max(dp[n - 3][n - 1], dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1, dp[n - 2][n - 2] + 1, dp[n - 2][n - 1] + 1, dp[n - 1][n - 1] + 1)` if the count is greater than `1`. The initial values of `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` remain `0`, and all other elements of `dp` are updated according to the loop logic. `i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be at least `1`, and `j` is `n - 1`.**

However, the description for the else part seems to have an inconsistency regarding the update rule for `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` when the count of `j + 1` is greater than `1`. Assuming the correct update rule is based on the provided logic, the corrected postcondition would be:
