The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of `j`. The loop will execute if `j` starts from `n - 1` and decrements down to `0`. Since `i` is already given as `1` and does not affect the loop head, we only need to ensure that `j` is initialized correctly for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, `j` must be set to `n - 1` initially, as specified in the range `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`.

State: **`dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body, `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`**
