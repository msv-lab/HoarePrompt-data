Postcondition: **The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. `i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be at least `1`, and `j` is `n - 3`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 0, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list is 1, `dp[i][j]` is `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`. Specifically, if the count of `j + 1` is 1, `dp[i][j]` has been updated to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)`. If the count of `j + 1` is greater than 1, `dp[i][j]` is `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`.**
