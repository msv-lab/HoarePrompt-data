The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement, `j` iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 3`.**
