The function `func_1()` takes no explicit input parameters. However, it is expected to read input from standard input (stdin). The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` at most 2 times. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
