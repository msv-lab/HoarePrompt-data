Postcondition: **The `dp` table is fully updated after `n` iterations of the loop, with each `dp[i][j]` value calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and the rules provided in the loop body. `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 3`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, `dp[1][n - 3]` is the maximum of `dp[2][n - 3]` and `dp[3][n - 4] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[1][n - 3]` is the maximum value among `dp[2][n - 3]`, `dp[3][n - 4] + 1`, and `dp[2][n - 2]`.**
