Let's analyze the provided Python code to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine how many valid values of `k` exist such that the `n`-th position in the sequence corresponds to the number `x`. The sequence is defined as repeating every `2k - 2` positions, with the first `k` positions increasing from `1` to `k` and the next `k - 2` positions decreasing from `k - 1` to `2`.

### Code Analysis
The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `generate`. Let's analyze each one:

1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
    - This function is supposed to generate the factors of `n` and then use those factors to generate all possible divisors of `n`.
    - It initializes a dictionary `factors` to store the prime factors of `n`.
    - It iterates through possible factors from `2` up to the square root of `n`, updating the `factors` dictionary.
    - After factoring, it converts the keys of the `factors` dictionary to a list `primes`.
    - It then calls `generate(0)` to generate all possible divisors of `n` based on its prime factorization.

2. **Function `generate(k)`**:
    - This is a recursive function that generates all possible divisors of `n` using the prime factors.
    - If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, it yields `1` (base case).
    - Otherwise, it recursively generates the divisors for the remaining primes and multiplies them by the current prime raised to different powers to generate all possible divisors.

### Issues in the Code
- The code provided does not actually solve the problem. It is intended to generate divisors of a number, but it does not connect this to the sequence described in the problem.
- The code does not calculate `k` based on the position `n` and the number `x` in the sequence.
- The code does not check the conditions that `k > 1` and that the sequence correctly maps `n` to `x`.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem, we need to:
1. Determine the period of the sequence, which is `2k - 2`.
2. Calculate the position within the period for `n`.
3. Check if the number at that position matches `x`.
4. Iterate over possible values of `k` to count how many fit the criteria.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem described. It does not implement the logic to determine the valid values of `k` based on the given position `n` and the number `x`.

**Correctness: False**
