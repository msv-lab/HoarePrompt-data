Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x < n, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is a list with at least one element, `prime` is the element at index `k` in the list `primes`, `factors` is a dictionary that contains `prime` as a key with a non-negative integer value, `prime_to_i` is `prime_to_i * prime`, `factor` is the next element in the list `rest`, and the value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

Natural language: The value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded, but the values of `k`, `n`, `x`, `primes`, `rest`, `prime`, `factors`, and `prime_to_i` remain unchanged.
