The given program is intended to solve the problem described, but there are several issues in the provided code that make it incorrect. Let's analyze the reasoning and the code step by step.

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Function `func_1` and `generate`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate all divisors of `n`. However, the `generate` function is not correctly implemented. It relies on a global variable `primes` that is not defined within the scope of the function. This will result in a `NameError` when `generate` is called.
   - The `generate` function is supposed to recursively generate all divisors of `n` using the prime factorization, but it incorrectly uses a global variable `primes` and `factors` which are not defined in its scope.

2. **Logic for Finding `k`**:
   - The program uses two sets `ans` and `ans2` to store the possible values of `k`. However, the logic to populate these sets is incorrect. The conditions for `k` are not correctly checked.
   - The condition `not k % 2 and k / 2 + 1 >= x` is not sufficient to determine if `k` is a valid solution. The correct logic should consider the periodic nature of the sequence and the position `n` and number `x`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is 1 or when `n` and `x` have specific relationships that do not fit the pattern.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find all possible values of `k` such that the position `n` corresponds to the number `x` in the described sequence. The sequence repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and within each segment of length `k` and `k-2`, the numbers are assigned in a specific pattern.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

1. **Determine the Period**:
   - The sequence repeats every `2k - 2` positions. For a given `n` and `x`, we need to find all `k` such that the position `n` maps to the number `x`.

2. **Check Valid `k` Values**:
   - For each possible `k`, check if the position `n` corresponds to the number `x` in the sequence. This involves checking both the increasing and decreasing segments of the sequence.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle edge cases such as when `x` is 1 or when `n` and `x` have specific relationships.

Given the issues in the provided code and the need for a correct approach, the program as given is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
