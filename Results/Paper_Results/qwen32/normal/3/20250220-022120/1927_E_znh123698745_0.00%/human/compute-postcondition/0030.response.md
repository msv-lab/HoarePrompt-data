Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `answer` is `[1]`, `a` is `[n//2 + 1, -n//2]` if `n` is even, or a similar adjusted state if `n` is odd, `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n`.**

Explanation: The `answer` list is reinitialized to `[1]`, while the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `array` remain unchanged.
