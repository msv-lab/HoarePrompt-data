The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element at the index `a[-1]` of the `array` to the `answer` list. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is even.
- `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- `i` is 1. If `i` is odd, `array` has its last element set to `n - 1` and `answer` is a list containing the integer `n`. Otherwise, `answer` has an additional element which is `array[a[0]]` and `a[0]` is incremented by 1.

Since `i` is 1 (odd), `array` has its last element set to `n - 1` and `answer` is a list containing the integer `n`. This means `answer` is `[n]` and `array` is `[1, 2, 3, ..., n-2, n-1, n-1]`.

The code snippet appends `array[a[-1]]` to `answer`. Here, `a[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`. Since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we assume `a` is a list that has been initialized with at least one element, and `a[-1]` is the index we need to use to access an element in `array`. 

If `a[-1]` is 0, then `array[a[-1]]` is `array[0]` which is `1`. If `a[-1]` is 1, then `array[a[-1]]` is `array[1]` which is `2`, and so on. Since `a` is not specified, we can't determine the exact value of `a[-1]`, but we know it will be an index into `array`.

For the sake of providing a specific output state, let's assume `a[-1]` is 0 (the simplest case). Then, `array[a[-1]]` is `array[0]` which is `1`. Therefore, `answer` becomes `[n, 1]`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `k` is even; `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive with the last element set to `n - 1`; `i` is 1; `answer` is a list containing the integers `n` and `1`.**
