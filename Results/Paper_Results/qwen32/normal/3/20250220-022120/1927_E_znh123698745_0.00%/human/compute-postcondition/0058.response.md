The variable `a` is assigned the list `[1, -1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `answer` is `[1]`, `a` is `[1, -1]`, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `answer` is `[1]`, `a` is `[1, -1]`, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`.**
