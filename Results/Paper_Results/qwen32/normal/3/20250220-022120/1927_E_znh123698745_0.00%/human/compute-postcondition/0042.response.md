The code `a[-1] -= 1` modifies the last element of the list `a`. In the initial state, `a` is referred to as `array`, which contains the sequence from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the last element of `array` is `n`. After executing the code, the last element of `array` becomes `n - 1`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, and `answer`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `k` is an input integer; `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n-1` with the last element decremented by 1; `i` is 3; `answer` is a list containing `n`.**
