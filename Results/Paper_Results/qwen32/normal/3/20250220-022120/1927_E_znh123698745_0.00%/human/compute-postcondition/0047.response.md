To determine the output state, we need to carefully analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the existing variables. Here is the provided code snippet:

```
answer.append(array[a[-1]])
```

This line of code appends an element from `array` to `answer`. Specifically, it appends the element at the index specified by the last element of `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `k` is an input integer
- `i` is 4

The variables `answer`, `array`, and `a` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, we can infer that `answer` is a list to which an element will be appended, `array` is a list from which an element will be accessed, and `a` is a list whose last element is used as an index.

Since the exact contents of `answer`, `array`, and `a` are not provided, we can only describe the change to `answer` based on the operation performed.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 4, `answer` contains the element `array[a[-1]]` appended to it.**

In natural language: The value of `n` remains greater than 4, `k` remains an input integer, and `i` remains 4. The list `answer` now includes an additional element, which is the element at the index `a[-1]` from the list `array`.
