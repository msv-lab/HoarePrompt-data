The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. Based on the initial state, `n` and `k` are already defined as integers with specific constraints. After the execution of the code snippet, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is even, and the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input.**
