The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` modifies the last element of the list `a`. Initially, `a` is `[1, -1]`. The last element of `a` is `-1`, and after subtracting 1 from it, the last element becomes `-2`. Therefore, the list `a` is now `[1, -2]`.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `answer`, and `array`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `answer` is `[1, n]`, `a` is `[1, -2]`, `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n`.**
