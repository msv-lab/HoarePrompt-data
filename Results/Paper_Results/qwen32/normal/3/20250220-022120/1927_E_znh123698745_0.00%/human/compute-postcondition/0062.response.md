The code snippet `a[-1] -= 1` modifies the last element of the list `a` by subtracting 1 from it. Initially, `a` is `[1, -1]`. After the operation, the last element of `a`, which is `-1`, becomes `-2`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `answer`, and `array`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `answer` is `[1, n]`, `a` is `[1, -2]`, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`.**
