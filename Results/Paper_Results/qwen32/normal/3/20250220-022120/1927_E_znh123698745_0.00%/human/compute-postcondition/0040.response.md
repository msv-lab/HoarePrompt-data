Let's analyze the given task step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `n` must be greater than 1.
  - `k` is an input integer.
  - `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n`.
  - The loop variable `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, but we know it was used in the loop.

- **For loop statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(1, n):
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

### Analysis
- The loop runs with `i` starting from 1 and going up to `n-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken a value from 1 to `n-2` (since `i` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs).
- To proceed to the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- The variable `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
- The variable `k` is an input integer and does not affect the loop's iteration directly, so it remains unchanged.
- The `array` is also not modified by the loop, so it remains the same.

### Adjustment for the Next Iteration
- The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`.
- If `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1`.

### Conclusion
Given that we do not know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can express the state at the start of the next iteration as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

However, to be more specific, if we assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`. Since we don't have the specific value of `x`, we can generalize it as:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Since we need to provide a concrete state, let's assume `i` was `x` and now it is `x + 1`. If `i` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `3`.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n`, `i` is 3.**

This assumes that `i` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration, which is a valid assumption given the loop's range. If `i` was a different value, adjust `i` accordingly.
