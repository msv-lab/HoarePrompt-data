To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `i` and the range `1` to `n`.

Here's the for loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `i` will start at 1 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.
- The loop will execute if the range `(1, n)` contains at least one value, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

### State Adjustments:
- The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function.
- The variable `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

The other variables (`k`, `answer`, `a`, and `array`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `answer` is `[1]`, `a` is `[1, -1]`, `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`**
