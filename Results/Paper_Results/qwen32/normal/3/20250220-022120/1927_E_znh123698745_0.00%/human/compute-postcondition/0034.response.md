The code appends the element from `array` at the index specified by the last element of `a` to the `answer` list. Given that `a` is `[1, -1]`, the last element of `a` is `-1`. In Python, a negative index in a list refers to the last element of the list. Therefore, `array[a[-1]]` refers to the last element of `array`.

Since `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n`, the last element of `array` is `n`. Thus, `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends `n` to `answer`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `array` remain unchanged. The only change is that `answer` now includes `n` as its second element.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `answer` is `[1, n]`, `a` is `[1, -1]`, `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n`.**
