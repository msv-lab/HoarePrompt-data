The given code snippet appends the element at the index specified by `a[0]` from the `array` to the `answer` list. Here's the breakdown:

- `a[0]` is `1` (since `a` is `[1, -1]`).
- `array[a[0]]` is `array[1]`, which is `2` (since `array` is a list containing the sequence from `1` to `n` and `(-1)` is not a part of the sequence, it seems like a typo and should be ignored. The sequence starts from `1`).

Therefore, `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends `2` to `answer`.

Given this, the updated `answer` list becomes `[1, 2]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `answer` is `[1, 2]`, `a` is `[1, -1]`, `array` is a list containing the sequence from 1 to `n`**.
