Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 4, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 4. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, `answer` contains the element `array[a[-1]]` appended to it and `a[-1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `answer` has an additional element `array[a[0]]` appended to it and `a[0]` is incremented by 1.**
