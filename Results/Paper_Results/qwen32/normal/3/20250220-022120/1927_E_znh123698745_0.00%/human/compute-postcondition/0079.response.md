Let's analyze the loop and the provided output states to deduce the final state after all iterations.

The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, and in each iteration, it appends an element from the `array` to the `answer` list based on the value of `(-1) ** i`. If `(-1) ** i` is `-1` (i.e., `i` is odd), it appends the element at the index `a[-1]` in `array` and decrements `a[-1]`. If `(-1) ** i` is `1` (i.e., `i` is even), it appends the element at the index `a[0]` in `array` and increments `a[0]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer (though `k` is not used in the loop).
- `answer` is `[1]`.
- `a` is `[1, -1]`.
- `array` is a list containing integers from `1` to `n`.

The loop will execute `n-1` times.

Let's break down the first few iterations:
1. `i = 1` (odd): `(-1) ** 1 == -1`, so append `array[a[-1]]` which is `array[-1]` (the last element of `array`), and decrement `a[-1]`. `answer` becomes `[1, n]`, and `a` becomes `[1, n-2]`.
2. `i = 2` (even): `(-1) ** 2 == 1`, so append `array[a[0]]` which is `array[1]` (the second element of `array`), and increment `a[0]`. `answer` becomes `[1, n, 2]`, and `a` becomes `[2, n-2]`.
3. `i = 3` (odd): `(-1) ** 3 == -1`, so append `array[a[-1]]` which is `array[n-2]`, and decrement `a[-1]`. `answer` becomes `[1, n, 2, n-1]`, and `a` becomes `[2, n-3]`.

Following this pattern, we can see that the loop alternates between appending the last element of the remaining part of `array` (for odd `i`) and the next element from the start of the remaining part of `array` (for even `i`).

This process continues until `i` reaches `n-1`. By the end of all iterations, the `answer` list will contain all elements from `array` in a specific alternating order. The `a` list will have been modified to reflect the indices that have been used.

The final state of `answer` will be a list that contains all integers from `1` to `n` in an alternating order starting from the end and then from the beginning.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **[1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., floor((n+1)/2), ceil((n+1)/2)]**.

In natural language, the output state is a list that starts with `1`, then alternates between the largest remaining number and the next smallest number, continuing this pattern until all numbers from `1` to `n` are included.
