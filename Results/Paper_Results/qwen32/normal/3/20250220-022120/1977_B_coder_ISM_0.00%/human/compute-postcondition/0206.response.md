The code snippet `flag = 1` sets the variable `flag` to 1. No other variables are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`s` contains 30 elements, each either '1', '0', or '-1', with `s[i]` specifically being '-1'. `flag` is 1. `length` remains 30, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29, `x` is the input integer, and `i` is 1. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.**
