Postcondition: **`s` contains 30 elements, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary digits of the input integer `x` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit; `flag` is 1 (since the if condition is true, implying `flag` was 1 before); `s[i]` is '0' (since the if condition is true, implying `s[0]` is '0'); `length` is 30; `t` remains unchanged; `nalla` is incremented by 29; `x` is an input integer; `i` is 0.**
