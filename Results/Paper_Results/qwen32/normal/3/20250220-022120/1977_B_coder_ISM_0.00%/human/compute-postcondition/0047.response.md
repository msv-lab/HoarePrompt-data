The only variables in the loop head are `i`, which is the loop variable, and the range `0` to `29`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the value of `i`.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4, the next value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `5` (since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration).

The other variables, `t`, `x`, `s`, `length`, and `flag`, are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list of 30 characters where `s[4]` is set to `'-1'` if `flag` is 0, `s[i] == s[i + 1]`, and `s[i] == '1'`, otherwise `s[4]` remains `'0'` if `flag` is 1 and `s[4]` is `'0'`, or `s` is updated such that each element is either `'1'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is set, or `'0'` if the corresponding bit of `x` is not set; `length` is 30; `flag` is either 0 or 1; `i` is 5**
