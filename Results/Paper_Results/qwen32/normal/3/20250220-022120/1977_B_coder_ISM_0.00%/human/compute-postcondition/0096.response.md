Postcondition: **The list `s` is either `['1', '1']`, `['0', '1']`, `['1', '0']`, or `['0', '0']` depending on whether the `i`-th bit of `x` is set or not. The variables `t`, `flag`, and `length` remain unchanged. The variable `nalla` is incremented by 1. The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(input())`. The variable `i` is 1.**
