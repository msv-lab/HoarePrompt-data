The value of `s[i]` is set to '0'. Given that `i` is 2, `s[2]` is now '0'. Since `s[2]` was previously '1' if `flag` was 1, and it is now set to '0', `flag` must have been 1. Therefore, `flag` is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` contains 30 elements, each either '1', '0', or '-1', except `s[2]` which is '0'; `flag` is 0; `length` is 30; `t` remains unchanged; `nalla` is incremented by 29; `x` is the input integer; `i` is 2.**
