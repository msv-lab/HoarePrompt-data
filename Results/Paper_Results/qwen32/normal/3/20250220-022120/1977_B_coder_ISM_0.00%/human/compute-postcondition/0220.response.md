Postcondition: **`s` contains 30 elements, each either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` was 0 and `s[2]` was equal to `s[3]` and both were '1', then `s[2]` is set to `'-1'` and `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s[2]` is '0' if `flag` was 1 and `s[2]` was '0', otherwise `s[2]` remains unchanged and `flag` remains unchanged. `length` is 30, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29, `x` is the input integer, and `i` is 2.**
