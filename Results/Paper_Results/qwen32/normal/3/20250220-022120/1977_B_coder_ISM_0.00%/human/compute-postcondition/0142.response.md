Postcondition: **The list `s` has transformed such that any sequence of consecutive '1's has the first '1' replaced by '-1' and subsequent '1's in that sequence are replaced by '0'. The variable `flag` is 0. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `length` remains unchanged. The variable `nalla` is incremented by 29. The variable `x` is assigned the value from user input. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.**
