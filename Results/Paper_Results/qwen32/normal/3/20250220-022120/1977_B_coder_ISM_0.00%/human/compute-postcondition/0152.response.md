The code snippet modifies the element at index `i - 1` of the sequence `s` to '-1'. Given that the initial state specifies that the element at index `i - 1` is '1', it will be changed to '-1'. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`length` must be greater than 1; `s` is a sequence where the element at index `i` is '0' and the element at index `i - 1` is '-1'.**
