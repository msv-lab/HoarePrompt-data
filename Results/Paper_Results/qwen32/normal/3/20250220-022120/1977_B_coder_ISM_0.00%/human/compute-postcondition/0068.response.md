Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `x` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters with a length of either 30 or 31; `flag` is 1 if it was 1 and `s[29]` was '0'; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged; `length` is either 30 or 31 depending on the value of `flag`. At this point, `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1'.**
