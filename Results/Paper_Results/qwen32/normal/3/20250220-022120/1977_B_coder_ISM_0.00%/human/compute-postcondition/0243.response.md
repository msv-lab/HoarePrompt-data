Postcondition: **`s` is a list of 30 or 31 elements, `flag` is 0 or 1, `length` is 30 or 31, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29 for each iteration, `x` is the input integer, `i` is 3. If the element at index 2 of `s` is '-1' and the element at index 3 of `s` is '0', then the element at index 3 of `s` is set to '0'. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s` related to the if condition.**
