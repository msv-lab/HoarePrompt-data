Postcondition: **The list `s` contains 30 elements, each either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of the integer `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `flag` is 0. The variable `length` remains unchanged. The variable `nalla` is incremented by 1. The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(input())`. If `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` was '0', then `s[i]` is now '1'. Additionally, `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is '1', and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`.**
