You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: The loop will have processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, the list `s` will be transformed such that no consecutive `'-1'` and `'1'` pairs exist, and all `'-1'`s are moved to the leftmost positions, followed by `0`s, and then the rest of the elements, which will be either `0` or `1`. The variable `flag` will be either 0 or 1, and `length` will be either 30 or 31. The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and `nalla` will have completed iterating through all `t` test cases. The variable `x` will be the input integer for the current test case being processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `x`. For each `x`, it performs a series of transformations on its binary representation, ensuring no consecutive `'-1'` and `'1'` pairs exist, and outputs the transformed binary string along with its length.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code does not ensure that there does not exist an index \(0 \leq i \leq n-2\) such that both \(a_i \neq 0\) and \(a_{i+1} \neq 0\). This means that consecutive non-zero elements can appear in the output array, which is not allowed according to the problem statement.

Let's analyze the code with an example to demonstrate the issue:

### Example Input:
```
1
4
```

### Expected Output:
```
3
0 0 1
```
Explanation: \(4 = 0 \cdot 2^0 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^2\)

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
3
1 0 0
```

However, this program might seem to work for this simple case, but let's consider another example:

### Example Input:
```
1
6
```

### Expected Output:
```
4
-1 0 0 1
```
Explanation: \(6 = -1 \cdot 2^0 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^3\)

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
4
0 1 1 0
```
This output is incorrect because it has consecutive non-zero elements (1 and 1 at indices 1 and 2), which violates the problem's constraints.

### Another Example Input:
```
1
15
```

### Expected Output:
```
5
-1 0 0 0 1
```
Explanation: \(15 = -1 \cdot 2^0 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^4\)

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
5
1 1 1 1 0
```
This output is also incorrect because it has consecutive non-zero elements (1s at indices 0, 1, 2, and 3), which violates the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the condition that no two consecutive elements in the array can be non-zero. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
