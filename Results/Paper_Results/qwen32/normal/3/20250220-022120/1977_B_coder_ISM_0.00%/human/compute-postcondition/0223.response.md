The code snippet `s[29] = '1'` changes the 30th element (index 29) of the list `s` from `'0'` to `'1'`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `flag`, `length`, `t`, `nalla`, and `x`.

Output State: **`s` is a list of 30 elements where consecutive '1's pairs are replaced by '-1' and '0's following '-1' are flipped to '1', except `s[29]` which is now '1'. `flag` is 1, `length` is 30, `t` remains unchanged, `nalla` is incremented by 29 for each iteration, `x` is the input integer.**
