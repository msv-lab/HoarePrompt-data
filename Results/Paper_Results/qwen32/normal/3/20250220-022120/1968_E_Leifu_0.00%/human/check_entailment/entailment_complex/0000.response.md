### Reasoning:

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a given integer `n`, and it outputs `n` pairs of coordinates that aim to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Output for Each Test Case:**
   - The program prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. This is a good start as it immediately gives us a Manhattan distance of `1` (between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`).
   - If `n` is `3`, it prints `(2, 3)`. This introduces a new distance of `2` (between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 3)`), and `1` (between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 3)`), making the set of distances `{0, 1, 2}`.
   - For `n` greater than `3`, it prints `(2, 4)` which introduces a new distance of `3` (between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`), and `2` (between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`), and `1` (between `(2, 3)` and `(2, 4)`).
   - It then prints diagonal points `(j, j)` for `j` from `4` to `n`. These points ensure that the maximum possible Manhattan distances are achieved. The distance between `(1, 1)` and `(j, j)` is `2*(j-1)`, which introduces new distances as `j` increases.

3. **Maximizing Distances:**
   - The strategy of placing points on the diagonal starting from `(4, 4)` ensures that the maximum possible Manhattan distances are covered. For example, for `n=5`, the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(5, 5)` will cover distances `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}`.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the output produced by the program. For `n=2`, the output is `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which gives distances `{0, 1}`.
   - For `n=3`, the output is `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`, which gives distances `{0, 1, 2}`.
   - For `n=4`, the output is `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(4, 4)`, which introduces more distinct distances.
   - The pattern continues similarly for larger `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the strategy to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances for each test case. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the output is consistent with the problem requirements.
