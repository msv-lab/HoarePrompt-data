To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
- `n` is at least 4.
- `j` is incremented by 1.

### Key Points:
- The value of `t` is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
- The value of `n` is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
- The variable `j` is incremented by 1 before the `print` statement is executed.

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))`.
- This means that the value of `j` is converted to a string, concatenated with a space, and then concatenated with the string representation of `j` again.

### Value of `j`:
- Since `j` is incremented by 1 before the `print` statement, the value of `j` at the time of printing is `j + 1`.
- However, the exact initial value of `j` is not provided, so we can only express the output in terms of `j` after it has been incremented.

### Output:
- The output will be the string representation of `j + 1` followed by a space and then the string representation of `j + 1` again.

### Final Output:
Output: **(j + 1) (j + 1) (where j is the value before it was incremented by 1)**

Since the exact initial value of `j` is not provided, we express the output in terms of `j` after it has been incremented by 1.
