To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided and understand the values of the variables involved.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50
- `n` is an input integer such that `n` > 3
- `j` is 4

The print statement is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

**Step-by-step Analysis:**
1. The variable `j` is explicitly given a value of 4.
2. The `print` statement converts `j` to a string using `str(j)`.
3. The expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and the string representation of `j` again.

Since `j` is 4, `str(j)` will be the string "4". Therefore, the expression evaluates to `"4" + " " + "4"`, which results in the string `"4 4"`.

**Final Output:**
Output: **4 4**
