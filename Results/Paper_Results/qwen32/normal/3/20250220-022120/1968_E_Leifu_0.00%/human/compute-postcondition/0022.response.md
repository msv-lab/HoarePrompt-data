The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print('2 4')`. This statement is a straightforward print command that outputs the string `'2 4'` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or `j` as described in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
- The initial state describes the input variables `t` and `n`, and some conditions for the variable `j`. However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement explicitly outputs the string `'2 4'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'2 4'`.

Output: **2 4**
