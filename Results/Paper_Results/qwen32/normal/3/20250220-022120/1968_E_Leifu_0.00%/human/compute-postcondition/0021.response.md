The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'2 3'`. This statement does not depend on the values of any variables or conditions described in the initial state. The initial state describes the conditions and values for variables `t`, `n`, and `j`, as well as the behavior of `i`, but these do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print('2 3')` statement will output the exact string `'2 3'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `j`, or `i`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **2 3**
