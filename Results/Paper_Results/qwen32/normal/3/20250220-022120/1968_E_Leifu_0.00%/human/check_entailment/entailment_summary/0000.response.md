Reasoning:  
The given program does not seem to correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). Let's analyze the program's behavior and compare it with the problem requirements.

The program handles the first two points as (1,1) and (1,2), which is a reasonable start as it provides a distance of 1. However, the subsequent points are not strategically placed to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example:
- When \(n = 3\), the program outputs (1,1), (1,2), and (2,3). The Manhattan distances here are 0, 1, and 2. This is correct for \(n = 3\).
- When \(n > 3\), the program outputs (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), and then (j,j) for \(j = 4\) to \(n\). This placement does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. For instance, with \(n = 4\), the distances will be 0, 1, 3, and then distances from (1,1) and (1,2) to (4,4) which are 6 and 5 respectively, but the distances from (2,4) to (4,4) is only 2, and from (2,4) to (1,1) and (1,2) are 5 and 4 respectively, which does not provide the maximum possible distinct distances.

The optimal strategy to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances involves placing points in a way that creates the maximum variety of distances. The example outputs provided in the problem statement show a more optimal placement of points for various values of \(n\).

Given the provided execution summary, the program does not follow an optimal strategy for all values of \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
