The `print('1 1')` statement in the provided code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string `'1 1'`. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, and `j` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the statement is hardcoded to print `'1 1'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes `t`, `n`, and `j` but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print('1 1')` statement directly outputs the string `'1 1'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **1 1**
