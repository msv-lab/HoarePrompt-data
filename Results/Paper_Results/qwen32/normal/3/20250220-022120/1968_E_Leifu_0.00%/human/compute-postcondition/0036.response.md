The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'2 4'`. The initial state describes variables `t`, `n`, and `i`, but these variables are not used within the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('2 4')`.
2. The string `'2 4'` is explicitly provided within the `print` statement.
3. The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are not referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not influence the output.

Thus, the output will be the exact string `'2 4'`.

Output: **2 4**
