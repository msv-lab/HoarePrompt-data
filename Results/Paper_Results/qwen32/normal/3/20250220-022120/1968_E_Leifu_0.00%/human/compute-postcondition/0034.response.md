The given code snippet is:

```python
print('1 2')
```

The initial state provided does not affect the content of the `print` statement because it directly prints the string `'1 2'`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are defined but not used in the print statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement specifies the exact string to be printed, which is `'1 2'`.
2. The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are not referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not influence the output.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'1 2'`.

Output: **1 2**
