Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50. However, `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is at least 4. However, `n` is also not used in the print statement.
- `j` can be any integer. The value of `j` is crucial here as it is used in the print statement.

### Print Statement:
```
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and then the string representation of `j` again.
- Since `j` can be any integer, the output will depend on the value of `j` at the time of execution.
- The output will be of the form: `j j` where `j` is the integer value.

### Conclusion:
Given that `j` can be any integer, the output will be the integer value of `j` printed twice, separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **j j (where j is the integer value of j)**
