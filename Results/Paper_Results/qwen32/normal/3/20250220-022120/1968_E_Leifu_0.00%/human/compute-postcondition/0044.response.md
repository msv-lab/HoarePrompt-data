Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an input integer; `i` is 3. If `n` is equal to 3, the program does not perform any additional actions. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the program prints each integer from 4 to `n`, with each integer printed twice on its respective line.**
