Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an integer input value and must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
4. `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.
5. `flag` is `False` (since the if condition is not met).
6. `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
7. `val` is `arr[0]`.
8. `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`.
9. `i` is `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is described as the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Since no previous value of `ans` is mentioned, it is reasonable to assume that `ans` is initialized to a value that is greater than or equal to `cnt` initially.
- `cnt` represents the length of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val` in the list `arr`. Since `arr` is derived from the input and `val` is set to `arr[0]`, `cnt` would be the length of the sequence starting from the first element of `arr` that are all equal to `arr[0]`.
- Given that `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and no specific initial value of `ans` is provided, we can infer that `ans` will eventually hold the smallest length of consecutive elements equal to `val` encountered in the list `arr`.

However, since we don't have the exact values of `arr`, `val`, or the initial value of `ans`, we can only describe the output based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
The variable `ans` will hold the minimum length of consecutive elements in `arr` that are equal to `val` (which is `arr[0]`).

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum length of consecutive elements in arr that are equal to arr[0])**
