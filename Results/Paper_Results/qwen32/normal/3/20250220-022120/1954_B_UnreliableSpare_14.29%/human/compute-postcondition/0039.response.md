Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input value and must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `flag` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `arr` are the same; `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`; `i` is `n`.**
