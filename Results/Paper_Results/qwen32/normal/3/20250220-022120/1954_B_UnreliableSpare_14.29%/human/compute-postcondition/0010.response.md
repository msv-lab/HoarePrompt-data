The `break` statement will terminate the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `i`, and `flag` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 4; `flag` is False; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
