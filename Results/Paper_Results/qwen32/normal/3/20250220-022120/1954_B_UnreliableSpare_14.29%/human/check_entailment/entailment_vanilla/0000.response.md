Let's analyze the given Python program step by step based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap

The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. The array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.

### Key Points

1. **Beautiful Array**: An array is beautiful if all its elements can be made the same by a series of allowed operations.
2. **Operation**: Choose an index `i` (2 <= i <= n-1) such that `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` and replace `a_i` with `a_{i-1}`.
3. **Goal**: Find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
4. **Output**: If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful, output `-1`.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the given program:

```python
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Checking if the Array is Uniform**:
   - It sets a `flag` to `True` initially.
   - It iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same.
     - If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks the loop.
   
3. **Calculating Minimum Removals**:
   - It initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and sets `val` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to `0`.
   - It then iterates through the array again.
     - If the current element is the same as `val`, it increments `cnt`.
     - If the current element is different, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `val` and `cnt` to the current element and `1` respectively.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to ensure the last sequence of elements is considered.
   
4. **Output**:
   - If `flag` is `True` (i.e., the array was uniform), it prints `-1` (impossible to make it non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Correctness

The program's logic has some issues:

- The program correctly identifies if the array is uniform and outputs `-1` in that case.
- However, the logic for calculating the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program attempts to find the shortest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same, but this does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Counterexample

Consider the test case:

```
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

- The program will identify that the array is not uniform.
- It will calculate `ans` as `1` (the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same).
- However, removing just one element (e.g., the middle `3`) will not make the array non-beautiful. The correct answer should be `2` (remove both `2`s or both `1`s).

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful in all cases.

**Correctness: False**
