Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; if `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains True and `i` remains 1.**
