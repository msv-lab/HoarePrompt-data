Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer input value and must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same; otherwise, `flag` is False; `ans` is Decimal('Infinity') if `arr[i]` equals `val`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is 1 if `arr[i]` equals `val`, otherwise `cnt` is 0; `arr[i]` either equals or does not equal `val`.**
