The code increments `idx` by the value of `n`. The value of `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`. The other variables (`a`, `data`, `t`, `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `5 + 2*n + n`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(n, a)` twice.**

In simpler terms, `idx` is now `5 + 3*n`. All other variables retain their initial states.
