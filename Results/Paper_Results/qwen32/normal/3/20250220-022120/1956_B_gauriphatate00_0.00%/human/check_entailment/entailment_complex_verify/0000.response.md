### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided code to ensure the assessment is correct.

#### Problem Recap:
- You and Nene each have `n` cards, with integers from 1 to `n` appearing exactly twice.
- You take turns placing cards on the table.
- You score a point if the card you place matches a card already on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.
- The objective is to determine the maximum number of points you can score if you play optimally.

#### Key Observations:
1. Each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck.
2. Nene's optimal strategy is to maximize her score and minimize yours.
3. The maximum points you can score are limited by the number of pairs you have and the number of turns you get (`n` turns).

#### Analysis of the Code:
- The code uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
- It calculates the number of pairs (`count == 2`) in your hand.
- The function `func_1` returns `min(pairs, n // 2)`, which represents the maximum points you can score.

#### Correctness Check:
- **Number of Pairs**: The code correctly counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
- **Maximum Points Calculation**: The code correctly calculates the maximum points you can score by taking the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`. This is because:
  - You can score at most one point per pair if Nene places the other card of the pair on the table before you.
  - You can take at most `n` turns, so you can score at most `n // 2` points in total (since you and Nene alternate turns).

#### Edge Cases:
- **No Pairs**: If there are no pairs in your hand, the function correctly returns 0.
- **All Pairs**: If all cards in your hand are pairs, the function correctly returns `n // 2` because you can score at most one point per pair.
- **Optimal Play**: The code assumes the worst-case scenario for you (best-case for Nene) by returning the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score given the constraints and the optimal play from Nene. It handles all edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**.
