To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify whether the logic implemented in `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, given Nene's optimal play.

Here is the key insight of the problem:
- You and Nene each have `n` cards.
- Each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck.
- You want to maximize your points, where a point is scored if the card you play already has a matching card on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize yours.

The optimal strategy involves understanding that:
- If you have a pair of cards with the same integer, playing one of them will not score you a point initially, but it will allow you to score a point when you play the second card in the pair.
- Nene will play optimally to avoid giving you points, but she will also try to minimize your score in case of ties.

The key observation is that the maximum number of points you can score is the minimum of:
1. The number of pairs you have (`pairs`).
2. Half the total number of cards you have (`n // 2`), because you can only score a point for each pair you complete.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the provided solution:
1. `func_1` calculates the number of pairs in your hand (`pairs`).
2. It then returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`.

This logic is correct because:
- If you have fewer pairs than `n // 2`, you can only score a point for each pair.
- If you have more pairs than `n // 2`, you can only score up to `n // 2` points because you can only complete `n // 2` pairs in total.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
