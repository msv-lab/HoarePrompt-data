The code `idx += n` increments the value of `idx` by the value of `n`. Given that `idx` was initially 2, after the execution, `idx` will be `2 + n`. The values of `n`, `a`, `data`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[2:2+n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list**.
