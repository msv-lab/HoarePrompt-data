The code snippet updates the variable `a` by mapping the next `n` elements in the `data` list starting from index `idx` to integers. 

Given the initial state, `a` was previously a list of integers from `data[2:2+n]`. After the execution of the code, `a` is reassigned to a new list of integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `n` remains the integer value of `data[idx]`
- `data` remains a list of strings
- `idx` remains `2 + n + 1`
- `t` remains `t - 1`
- `results` remains a list containing the output of `func_1(n, a)`, but note that `a` has been updated, so `results` might need to be recalculated based on the new `a` if `func_1` is dependent on `a`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `2 + n + 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(n, a)`**.
