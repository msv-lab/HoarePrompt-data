### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Players**: You and Nene.
- **Cards**: 2n cards, each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
- **Turns**: 2n turns, n turns each, starting with you.
- **Scoring**: You score a point if the card you place matches a card already on the table.
- **Nene's Strategy**: Maximizes her score and minimizes your score.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Pairs in Your Hand**: If you have pairs, you can potentially score points if Nene places the other card of the pair on the table before you.
2. **Optimal Play**: Nene will play to maximize her score and minimize yours. This means she will try to avoid giving you points by placing cards strategically.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**: 
  - Uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each card in your hand.
  - Counts the number of pairs (`count == 2`).
  - Returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Reads input from standard input.
  - Processes multiple test cases.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

#### Function Summary:
- The function summary provided is incorrect. It states that the function prints `True` or `False`, but the actual function `func_1` returns an integer representing the maximum number of points you can score.

#### Correctness Check:
- **Logic of `func_1`**:
  - **Number of Pairs**: Correctly identifies pairs in your hand.
  - **Maximum Points**: The result is the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2` because you can score at most one point per pair, and you can take at most `n // 2` turns.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - **No Pairs**: Returns 0, correct.
  - **All Pairs**: Returns `n // 2`, correct.
  - **Nene's Optimal Play**: The code assumes the worst-case scenario for you (best-case for Nene) by returning the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

#### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score, given the constraints and Nene's optimal play. The function summary is inaccurate, but the code itself is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
