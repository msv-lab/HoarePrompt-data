You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Annotated Code: 
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, and a is a list of n integers where each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times.
def func_1(n, a):
    counter = Counter(a)
    pairs = sum(1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2)
    return min(pairs, n // 2)
    #The program returns the minimum value between the number of integers in `a` that appear exactly 2 times and half the number of cards each player receives (`n // 2`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most twice. It returns the minimum value between the number of integers in `a` that appear exactly twice and half the number of cards each player receives (`n // 2`).

        print(result)
        
    #State: `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` from the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx - n - 1:idx - 1]` from the last iteration, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is the position right after the last processed segment of data, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing all the elements processed by the loop, and `result` is the last element of `results`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of a number `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and prints the result of processing each test case. The processing involves determining if the list `a` contains pairs of each integer from 1 through `n`. If it does, the function prints `True`; otherwise, it prints `False`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the code step-by-step.

### Problem Summary:
- You and Nene each have `n` cards, with each card having an integer from 1 to `n` and each integer appearing exactly twice in the deck.
- You and Nene take turns placing cards on the table.
- You score a point if the card you place matches a card already on the table.
- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.
- The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score if you play optimally.

### Key Observations:
1. If a card appears twice in your hand, you can score a point if Nene places the same card on the table before you place the second card.
2. If a card appears only once in your hand, you cannot score a point with it unless Nene places the same card on the table before you.
3. Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. This means she will try to avoid giving you points and will place cards that prevent you from scoring points.

### Analysis of the Code:
- The code uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
- It calculates the number of pairs (`count == 2`) in your hand.
- The function `func_1` returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`, which represents the maximum points you can score.

### Correctness Check:
- The code correctly identifies the number of pairs in your hand.
- The result is the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2` because:
  - You can score at most one point per pair if Nene places the other card of the pair on the table before you.
  - You can take at most `n // 2` turns, so you can score at most `n // 2` points in total.

### Edge Cases:
- If there are no pairs in your hand, the function correctly returns 0.
- If all cards in your hand are pairs, the function correctly returns `n // 2` because you can score at most one point per pair.
- If Nene plays optimally, she will try to prevent you from scoring points, but the code assumes the worst-case scenario for you (best-case for Nene) by returning the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score given the constraints and the optimal play from Nene. It handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code correctly identifies the number of pairs in your hand and calculates the maximum points you can score by taking the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`, which accounts for the optimal play from Nene.
