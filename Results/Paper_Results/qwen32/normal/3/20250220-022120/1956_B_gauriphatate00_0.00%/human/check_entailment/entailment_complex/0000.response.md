### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get in a card game where each player plays optimally. The key to solving the problem is to understand that you can score a point only if the card you play has already been placed on the table by either player. Since Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, the strategy revolves around the pairs of cards you and Nene have.

Here's a breakdown of the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1(n, a)`**:
   - **Purpose**: To determine the maximum number of points you can get.
   - **Logic**: It counts how many integers appear exactly twice in your hand (`a`). This is because you can score a point only if you play a card that has already been placed on the table. Since Nene plays optimally, she will try to minimize your points, so the best you can do is to play cards that have pairs in your hand. However, you can only play up to `n // 2` turns, so the result is the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`.
   - **Correctness**: This logic aligns with the problem requirements. You can score a point only if you have a pair, and your optimal strategy is to play pairs if you have them.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - **Purpose**: To read multiple test cases from standard input, process them using `func_1`, and print the results.
   - **Logic**: It reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and stores the results. After processing all test cases, it prints each result.
   - **Correctness**: This function correctly handles multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to compute the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Both functions work together to solve the problem correctly. `func_1` computes the maximum number of points you can get based on the optimal play by Nene, and `func_2` handles the input/output for multiple test cases.

**Correctness: True**
