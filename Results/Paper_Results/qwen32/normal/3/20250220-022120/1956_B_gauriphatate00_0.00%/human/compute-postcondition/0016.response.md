The code snippet `idx += n` increments the value of `idx` by `n`. Therefore, the new value of `idx` will be `2 + n + 1 + n`, which simplifies to `3 + 2*n + 1` or `4 + 2*n`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `4 + 2*n`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(n, a)`**.
