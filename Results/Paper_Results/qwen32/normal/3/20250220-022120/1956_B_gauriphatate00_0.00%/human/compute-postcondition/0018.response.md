The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 before the decrement.

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `4 + 2*n`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(n, a)` twice.**
