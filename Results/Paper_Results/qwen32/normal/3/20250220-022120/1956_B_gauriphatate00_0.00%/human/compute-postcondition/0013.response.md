The code snippet `n = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `n` by converting the string at the index `idx` in the list `data` to an integer. This means the value of `n` will change to whatever integer value is represented by the string at `data[idx]`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation, which they are not in this case.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[2:2+n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(n, a)`**.

In natural language, the value of `n` is now the integer value of the string found at `data[idx]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
