The code snippet appends the result of `func_1(n, a)` to the `results` list. The values of `n`, `a`, and `data` are not altered by this operation, and `idx` and `t` remain unchanged as well. The only change is that `results` now contains one additional element, which is the output of `func_1(n, a)`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[2:2+n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is `2 + n`, `t` is a positive integer, `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(n, a)`**.
