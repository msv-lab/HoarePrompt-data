Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, and a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times. The function returns a value based on the distribution of the integers in the list `a`. If the list `a` contains pairs of each integer from 1 through `n`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
