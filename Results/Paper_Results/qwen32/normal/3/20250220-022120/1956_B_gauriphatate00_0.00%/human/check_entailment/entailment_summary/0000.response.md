### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can score in a card game where you and Nene each have `n` cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to `n` on it, with each integer appearing exactly twice. The game proceeds in 2n turns, with each player taking n turns, and a player scores a point if they play a card that already has a matching card on the table.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To calculate the maximum number of points you can score given your hand of cards.
- **Logic**: The function counts how many integers appear exactly twice in your hand (`pairs`). The maximum number of points you can score is the minimum of these pairs and `n // 2` (since you can only make `n // 2` pairs in total, and Nene plays optimally to minimize your score).
- **Execution Summary**: The function correctly calculates the number of integers that appear exactly twice and returns the minimum of this count and `n // 2`.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To read multiple test cases from standard input, process each test case using `func_1`, and print the results.
- **Logic**: The function reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers. It then calls `func_1` to compute the result for that test case and stores the result. Finally, it prints all the results.
- **Execution Summary**: The function correctly reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results. However, the description of the output hints for `func_2` seems to have a minor error: it incorrectly states that the function prints `True` or `False`. Instead, it prints the maximum number of points you can score for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Both functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score, and `func_2` correctly reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

Thus, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
