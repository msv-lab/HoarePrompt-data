The code snippet converts the slice of the `data` list, starting from index `idx` and ending at `idx + n`, into a list of integers and assigns this list to the variable `a`. Given the initial state, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings, and `idx` is 2.

After the code snippet executes, `a` will be a list of integers derived from the slice `data[2:2+n]`. The values of other variables (`n`, `data`, `idx`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[2:2+n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is 2, `t` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list**.
