Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` from the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx - n - 1:idx - 1]` from the last iteration, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is the position right after the last processed segment of data, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing all the elements processed by the loop, and `result` is the last element of `results`.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` retains the integer value from the last segment of `data` processed, `a` holds the list of integers from the segment preceding the last one, `data` remains the same list of strings, `idx` points right after the last segment processed, `t` is still 0, and `results` contains all the outputs from `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration. The variable `result` in the loop head will be the last element of `results` during the final iteration.
