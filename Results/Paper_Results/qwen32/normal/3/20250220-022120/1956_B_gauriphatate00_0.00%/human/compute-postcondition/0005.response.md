The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `data`, `idx`, or `t`. Therefore, the output state remains the same with the addition of the new variable `results`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards each player receives, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line, `idx` is 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list.**
