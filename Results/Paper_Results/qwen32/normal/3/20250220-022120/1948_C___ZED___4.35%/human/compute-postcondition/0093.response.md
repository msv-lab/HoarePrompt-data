The `print('YES')` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.

Here's the breakdown:
- The variable `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- The variable `i` is set to 2.
- The variable `n` is an input integer.
- The variable `a` is a new string input from the user.
- The variable `b` is another new string input from the user.

None of these variables affect the `print` statement because the statement directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
