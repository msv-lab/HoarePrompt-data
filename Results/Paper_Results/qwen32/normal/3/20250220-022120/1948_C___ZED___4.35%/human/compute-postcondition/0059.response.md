Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the new string input from the user, `b` is the new string input from the user, `k` is `k + 2`, and `no_path` is `False` if `b[k]` is not `'>'`. Otherwise, `no_path` retains its original value.**
