Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the new string input from the user, `b` is the new string input from the user, `k` is the last checked index (which is `n - 2` if `n` is even or `n - 2` if `n` is odd), `no_path` is True indicating that at least one character at an even index in `b` is not '>'**

In this output state, the value of `no_path` has been changed to `True`. All other variables retain their previously described states.
