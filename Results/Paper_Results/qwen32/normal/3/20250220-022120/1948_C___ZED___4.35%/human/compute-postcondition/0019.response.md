Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a string input from the user, `b` is the next string input from the user, and the second-to-last character of `b` is `'>'`, `k` is 4, `no_path` is `False`.**

Explanation: The variable `no_path` is explicitly set to `False` in the code snippet, while all other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
