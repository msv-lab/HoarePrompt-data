Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `0`, `n` is an integer input greater than or equal to `2`, `a` is a string input from the user, `b` is a string input from the user with the second-to-last character being `'>'`. All characters at even indices in `b` are `'>'` and all characters at odd indices `k` in `a` (where `k` ranges from 1 to `n-2` in steps of 2) are `'>'`. The value of `no_path` is `True`.**
