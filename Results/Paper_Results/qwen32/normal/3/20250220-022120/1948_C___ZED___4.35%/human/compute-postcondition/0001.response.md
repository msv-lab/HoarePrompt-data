Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially defined. The value of `i` remains 0 as it was not altered by the code snippet. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the next integer input.
