To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is initialized to 1.
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - `a` is a new string input from the user.
   - `b` is another new string input from the user.
   - `no_path` is initially set to `False` and changes to `True` if `a[k]` is equal to `'>'`. However, the value of `no_path` is not relevant to the print statement.
   - `k` is explicitly set to 3.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(k)`.

3. **Value of `k`:**
   - From the initial state, it is clearly stated that `k` is 3.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `k`, which is 3.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **3**
