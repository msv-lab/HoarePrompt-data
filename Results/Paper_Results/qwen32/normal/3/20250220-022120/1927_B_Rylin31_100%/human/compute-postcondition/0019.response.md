The code snippet provided updates the `array` variable by reading a new list of integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `s`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged as per the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is a string constructed by appending characters based on the values of `s[j]` incremented by 97 for each `j` in the previous `array`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, `array` is now a new list of integers provided by the user input, while all other variables retain their previous values.
