The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is the loop variable that iterates over the elements of `array`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `j` and how it changes with each iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`. However, `i` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- `t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` is 1, `array` is a new list of integers with at least 1 element, `ans` is 'a'.
- The loop iterates over `j` in `array`.

Since `j` takes on the value of each element in `array` in sequence, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be the next element in `array`.

Let's denote the current value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration as `array[k]`. At the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `array[k + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `t` remains 1.
- `l` remains the same input integer.
- `s` remains a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` is 1. Note that `j` is the current index in `array`, not the index in `s`, so `s` does not change in terms of its definition.
- `array` remains the same list of integers.
- `ans` remains 'a'.
- `j` is the next element in `array`.

State: **`t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` is 1, `array` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `ans` is 'a', `j` is the next element in `array`**.
