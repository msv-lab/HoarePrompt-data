The code snippet `ans = ''` directly assigns an empty string to the variable `ans`. This means that the previous value of `ans` is discarded, and `ans` now holds an empty string. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `s`, `array`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is `i + 1`**.
