Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid string s exists.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = ''
    for j in array:
        ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
        s[j] += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element `s[j]` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is a string constructed by appending characters based on the values of `s[j]` incremented by 97 for each `j` in `array`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` integers where each element at index `j` is the number of times `j` appears in `array`, `array` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is a string where each character is derived from `chr(s[j] + 97)` for each `j` in `array`, `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: - `t` is 1
- `l` is the new input integer
- `s` is a list where each `s[j]` reflects the number of times the index `j` appeared in `array`
- `array` is unchanged
- `ans` is a string formed by concatenating characters derived from the values in `s` (each value `s[j]` corresponds to a character `chr(s[j] + 97)`)
- `i` is `i + 1`

Output State:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
