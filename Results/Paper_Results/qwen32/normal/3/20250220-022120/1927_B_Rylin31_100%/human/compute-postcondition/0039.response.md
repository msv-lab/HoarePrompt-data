The code snippet `s[j] += 1` increments the value at the index `j` of the list `s` by 1. Given the initial state, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, and `j` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we will assume `j` is a valid index within the bounds of the list `s`.

Since `s` is a list of `l` zeros, after the operation `s[j] += 1`, the element at index `j` will be 1, and all other elements will remain 0.

Here is the output state:
Output State: **`t` is 1, `l` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except `s[j]` which is 1, `array` must have at least one element, `ans` is `'a'`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still 1, `l` remains the new input integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros except the element at index `j` which is now 1, `array` still has at least one element, `ans` is still `'a'`, and `i` has been incremented by 1.
