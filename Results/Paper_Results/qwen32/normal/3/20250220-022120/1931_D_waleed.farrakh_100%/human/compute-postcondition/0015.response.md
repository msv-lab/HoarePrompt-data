The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0, meaning it should be at least 1.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from `data[3]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[3]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[3]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t - 1` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing two tuples `[(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr)]`, `idx` is 5**
