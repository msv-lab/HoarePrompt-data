### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to understand if it correctly identifies and counts the number of beautiful pairs in the array.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Beautiful Pair Definition**: A pair of indices \( \langle i, j \rangle \) (with \( 1 \le i < j \le n \)) is considered beautiful if:
  1. \( a_i + a_j \) is divisible by \( x \).
  2. \( a_i - a_j \) is divisible by \( y \).

#### Provided Solution:
The solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

- **func_2**: This function reads the input, parses it into test cases, and then calls `func_1` to process these test cases. It prints the results for each test case.
- **func_1**: This function processes each test case to count the number of beautiful pairs:
  - It initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of pairs \((rx, ry)\) where:
    - \( rx = (-a \% x + x) \% x \) (ensures \( rx \) is non-negative)
    - \( ry = a \% y \)
  - For each element in the array, it checks if the pair \((rx, ry)\) has been seen before in the frequency dictionary. If so, it increments the count by the frequency of this pair.
  - It then updates the frequency dictionary for the current element.

#### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Modulo Operations**:
   - The expression for \( rx \) ensures that the remainder is always non-negative, which is important for correct dictionary indexing.
   - \( ry \) is simply the remainder of the element when divided by \( y \).

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The core idea is to use the frequency of previously seen pairs \((rx, ry)\) to count the number of beautiful pairs efficiently.
   - For each element \( a_i \), the pair \((rx, ry)\) is calculated, and if this pair has been seen before, it means there are previous elements \( a_j \) (with \( j < i \)) that form beautiful pairs with \( a_i \).

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - The solution processes each element of the array once, making it efficient with a time complexity of \( O(n) \) per test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - The provided example input is correctly processed, and the output matches the expected results, indicating that the logic is sound.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. Therefore, the solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
