Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `test_cases` must contain at least one more tuple; `results` is a list containing the single element `count`; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array); `test_cases` must contain at least one more tuple where `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the single element `count`; `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq[(rx, ry)]` is incremented by 1 and `count` is updated to `freq[(rx, ry)]`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq` is updated to include `current_pair` with a value of `1` and `count` remains unchanged. `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is `a % y` for the current element `a` in `arr`. `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `test_cases` must contain at least one more tuple where `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the single element `count`; `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `freq[(rx, ry)]` is incremented by 1, and `count` is updated to `freq[(rx, ry)]`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq` is updated to include `current_pair` with a value of `1`, and `count` remains unchanged. `ry` is `a % y` for the current element `a` in `arr`. `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`; `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `test_cases` must contain at least one more tuple where `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the single element `count`; `ry` is `a % y`; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq[(rx, ry)]` is incremented by 1 and `count` is updated to `freq[(rx, ry)]`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq` is updated to include `(rx, ry)` with a value of `1`, and `count` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
