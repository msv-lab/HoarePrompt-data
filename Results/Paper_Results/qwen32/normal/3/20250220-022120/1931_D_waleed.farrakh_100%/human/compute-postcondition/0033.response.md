Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` (an integer representing one of Polycarp's favorite integers), `y` (an integer representing the other favorite integer), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array). `results` is an empty list. `freq` is a dictionary. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1 and `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[current_pair]`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq` is updated to include `current_pair` with a value of 1. `arr` is the list from the first tuple in `test_cases` and has at least one element. `a` is the third element of `arr`. `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`. `ry` is `a % y`. `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`**
