The code snippet `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. Initially, `idx` is 3, so after the increment, `idx` becomes 5. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `data`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from `data[3]`, `x` is the second integer from `data[3]`, `y` is the third integer from `data[3]`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[0]` is the string representation of `t - 1` and the remaining elements are the subsequent lines of input, `test_cases` is a list containing two tuples `[(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr)]`, `idx` is 5**.
