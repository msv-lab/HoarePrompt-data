The only variables in the loop head are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, which are unpacked from the `test_cases` iterable. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the next iteration of the loop. Given that `test_cases` remains unchanged, the next iteration will unpack the next tuple from `test_cases`.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not provide specific values for `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` from the current iteration, we can infer that the next iteration will take the next tuple from `test_cases`. Let's denote the next tuple as `(n_next, x_next, y_next, arr_next)`.

State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged; `results` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `count`; `freq` is a dictionary with keys as `(rx, ry)` pairs and values as their frequencies; `count` is the total number of times any pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before; `n` is `n_next`; `x` is `x_next`; `y` is `y_next`; `arr` is `arr_next`**
