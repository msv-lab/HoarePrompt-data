### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the logic and correctness of the provided code based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Recap:
A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (1 \(\le\) i < j \(\le\) n) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

#### Code Analysis:
The code uses a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of pairs of remainders. For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates:
- `rx`: The remainder of \(-a\) when divided by \(x\), adjusted to be non-negative.
- `ry`: The remainder of \(a\) when divided by \(y\).

The pair `(rx, ry)` is used to check if there are any previously seen pairs that would form a beautiful pair with the current element `a`.

#### Key Points:
1. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x` to ensure it is non-negative.
   - `ry` is calculated as `a % y`.

2. **Checking for Beautiful Pairs**:
   - If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, it means there are previously seen elements that, when paired with the current element `a`, could form a beautiful pair. The count of such pairs is added to `count`.

3. **Updating Frequency Dictionary**:
   - The current pair `(a % x, a % y)` is added to the `freq` dictionary.

#### Correctness Verification:
The logic in `func_1` is based on the following key mathematical properties:
- For \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by \(x\), \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\). This is correctly captured by `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`.
- For \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\). This is correctly captured by `ry = a % y`.

The code uses these remainders to efficiently count pairs that satisfy both conditions.

#### Testing with Example Cases:
Let's verify the code with the provided example cases.

#### Example 1:
Input:
```
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
```
Output:
```
2
```
Explanation:
- Pairs: \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\) and \(\langle 4, 6 \rangle\) are beautiful.

#### Example 2:
Input:
```
7 9 5
1 10 15 3 8 12 15
```
Output:
```
0
```
Explanation:
- No pairs satisfy both conditions.

#### Example 3:
Input:
```
9 4 10
14 10 2 2 11 11 13 5 6
```
Output:
```
1
```
Explanation:
- Pair: \(\langle 2, 5 \rangle\) is beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic to count beautiful pairs according to the problem description. It handles the constraints and edge cases effectively. The frequency dictionary `freq` is used to efficiently count potential pairs, and the remainder calculations are correct.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**.
