Output State: **`test_cases` remains unchanged; `results` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `count`; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `count` is the total number of times any pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before; `n` is `n_next`; `x` is `x_next`; `y` is `y_next`; `arr` is `arr_next`.**

In this output state, the `freq` dictionary has been reset to an empty dictionary, while all other variables retain their initial values.
