### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Splitting Logic**:
   - The program attempts to split an element only if it is greater than the next element and greater than 10. This is a flawed approach because any element that is at least 10 should be considered for splitting, regardless of its relationship with the next element. For example, in the array `[12, 2, 5]`, the element `12` should be split into `1` and `2` to achieve a sorted array `[1, 2, 2, 5]`.

2. **Handling Multiple Splits**:
   - The program only performs one split per iteration and does not handle the case where multiple splits are needed to sort the array. For instance, in the array `[123, 4, 5]`, the element `123` needs to be split into `1`, `2`, and `3` to allow the array to be sorted. The current logic does not account for this iterative process.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted. However, the main logic for splitting and checking needs to be improved as mentioned above.

### Conclusion:

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases and can produce incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for splitting elements and handling multiple splits.
