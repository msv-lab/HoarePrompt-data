Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and then the array elements.

2. **Operation Implementation**:
   - The program iterates over the array to check if the current element is greater than the next element and if it is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If such a condition is met, it attempts to split the current element into its digits and insert them back into the array at the same position.
   - However, the logic for splitting and inserting digits is incorrect. The operation `a // 10` and `a % 10` will only split a two-digit number into its tens and units place, which is correct, but the loop only checks adjacent elements and does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed or where splits affect the order of elements further down the list.

3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - After attempting to perform the operations, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function correctly checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Yes" or "No" based on whether the array is sorted after attempting to perform the operations.

### Issues in the Program:
- The main issue is that the program only checks adjacent elements and attempts to split numbers that are greater than the next element and greater than or equal to 10. This logic is insufficient because:
  - It does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed.
  - It does not handle cases where a split affects the order of elements further down the list.
  - It does not guarantee that the array will be sorted after a single pass.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not guaranteed to correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the described operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
