The code sorts the outer list `lst`, where each element of `lst` is a list of integers. The sorting is based on the natural ordering of the inner lists. This means that the inner lists are compared lexicographically, similar to how words are ordered in a dictionary.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) such that each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The outer list contains t inner lists (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), each representing a separate test case, and `lst` is now sorted lexicographically. `sorted_lst` is a new list that is a sorted version of `lst`.**
