Given the initial state and the Python code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print(-1)` statement executes.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (this variable does not affect the print statement).
- `n`: An integer (the length of list `arr`).
- `a`: A list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n` (this variable does not affect the print statement).
- `arr`: A list of integers read from the input.
- `flag`: A boolean set to True, indicating all elements in `arr` are the same.
- `val`: The first element of the list `arr`.
- `cnt`: The length of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val` if the loop ends with a sequence of such elements.
- `ans`: The minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.
- `i`: Set to `n-1`.

### Analysis:
The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(-1)` statement will output the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
