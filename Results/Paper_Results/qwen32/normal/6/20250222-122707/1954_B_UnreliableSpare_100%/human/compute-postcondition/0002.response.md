Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `flag` is True.**

In natural language: The value of `flag` has been set to `True`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`) retain their initial values and properties.
