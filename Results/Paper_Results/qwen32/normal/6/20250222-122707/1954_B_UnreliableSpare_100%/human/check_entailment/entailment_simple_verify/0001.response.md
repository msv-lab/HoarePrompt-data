### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the provided program's logic. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Uniform Array Case:**
   - The program correctly identifies if all elements in the array are the same and outputs `-1` in this case. This is because a uniform array cannot stop being beautiful by removing elements.

2. **Non-Uniform Array Case:**
   - The program attempts to find the smallest contiguous subarray of uniform elements in the array. However, this approach is flawed. The smallest uniform subarray does not necessarily determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. 

3. **Flaw in the Logic:**
   - The programâ€™s approach of finding the smallest uniform subarray is insufficient. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The smallest uniform subarray is of length `1` (either `[1]` or `[2]`), but removing one element is not enough to make the array non-beautiful. The correct answer is `1` (removing any middle `1` or `2`).

4. **Counterexample:**
   - The example provided in the original assessment (`[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`) demonstrates this flaw. The program would output `1` (the smallest uniform subarray length), but the correct answer is `1` (removing any middle `1` or `2`), which means the program's logic fails to generalize correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make a non-uniform array stop being beautiful. The logic for finding the smallest uniform subarray is insufficient.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
