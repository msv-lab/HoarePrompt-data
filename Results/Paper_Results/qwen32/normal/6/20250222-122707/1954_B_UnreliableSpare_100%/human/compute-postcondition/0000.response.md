The code provided reads an integer `n` from the input. This integer `n` represents the number of elements in the list `a` for the current test case. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range and that `a` is a list of integers with specific properties. The value of `n` is updated based on the input, but the other variables (`t` and the list `a`) remain unchanged until further instructions are given.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.**
