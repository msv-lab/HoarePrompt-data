Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`. If `arr[i]` equals `val`, `cnt` is 3 and `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'). Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 5.**

In simpler terms: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is greater than 5, `a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `flag` indicates if all elements in `arr` are the same, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If `arr[i]` equals `val`, `cnt` is set to 3 and `ans` to Decimal('Infinity'). Otherwise, `cnt` is set to 0 and `ans` remains either 0 or 1, with `i` remaining 5.**
