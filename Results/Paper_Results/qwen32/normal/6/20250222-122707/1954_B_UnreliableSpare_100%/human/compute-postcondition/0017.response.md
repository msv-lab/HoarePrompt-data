The code snippet assigns the variable `ans` the value `Decimal('Infinity')`. This means `ans` is now set to positive infinity. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `flag`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False, `ans` is Decimal('Infinity')**.
