Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False, `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'), `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0**

In natural language: The value of `val` is now set to the first element of the list `arr`, and `cnt` is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
