Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`. If `arr[i]` equals `val`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'). Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0, `i` is 4**.

In natural language: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so if `cnt` was 1, it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
