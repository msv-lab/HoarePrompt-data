You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.

Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Elements to Remove:**
   - The program calculates the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of identical elements (`ans`). However, this is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.
   - For example, in the fourth test case:
     ```
     7
     3 3 3 5 3 3 3
     ```
     The program will output `3` because it finds the contiguous subarray `3 3 3` of length `3` and considers it as the minimum to remove. However, removing just these three elements will not make the array stop being beautiful. The correct answer is `3` because you need to remove the first three `3`s to get `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is already not beautiful correctly. For example, if the array is already not beautiful, the program should return `0` instead of `Infinity`.

3. **Incorrect Use of `Decimal('Infinity')`:**
   - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simple large number or `float('inf')` for comparison purposes.

4. **Logic for Checking if the Array is Already Beautiful:**
   - The program checks if all elements are the same using a flag, but this is not sufficient to determine if the array is beautiful as per the problem definition. The array can be beautiful even if it is not composed of identical elements, as long as the condition `a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1}` holds for all valid `i`.

To fix the program, a more comprehensive approach is needed to identify the minimum number of elements to remove. This includes checking the structure of the array and ensuring that removing the minimum number of elements results in an array that no longer satisfies the beautiful condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        flag = True
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if arr[i - 1] == arr[i + 1]:
                flag = False
                break
        if flag:
            print(-1)
            continue
        ans = float('inf')
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            j = i
            while j + 1 < n and arr[j] == arr[j + 1]:
                j += 1
            length = j - i + 1
            ans = min(ans, length)
            i = j + 1
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version properly handles the cases and ensures that the minimum number of elements to remove is calculated correctly.
