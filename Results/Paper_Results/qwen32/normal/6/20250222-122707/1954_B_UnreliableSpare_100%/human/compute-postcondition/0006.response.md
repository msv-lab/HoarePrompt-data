Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `flag` is False, and the current element `arr[i]` is not equal to the previous element `arr[i - 1]`. The loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `flag`, and the condition about `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` remain unchanged. The loop or if statement that this `break` statement is inside is exited.
