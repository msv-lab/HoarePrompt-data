The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False, `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'), `val` is `arr[0]`, and `cnt` is 1 (since it was incremented from 0).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False, `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'), `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 1**.
