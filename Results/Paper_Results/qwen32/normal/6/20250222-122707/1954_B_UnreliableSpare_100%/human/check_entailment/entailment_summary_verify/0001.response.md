### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make a non-uniform array stop being beautiful. Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **Uniform Array Case:**
   - The program correctly identifies if all elements in the array are the same and outputs `-1` in such cases. This part of the logic is correct.

2. **Non-Uniform Array Case:**
   - The program attempts to find the smallest contiguous subarray of uniform elements (`ans`), but this approach is flawed. The smallest uniform subarray does not necessarily indicate the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`:
     - The smallest uniform subarray here is of length `1` (either `[1]` or `[2]`).
     - However, removing any single element (e.g., the middle `1` or `2`) does not make the array stop being beautiful. The correct answer should be `1` because removing any middle element results in `[1, 2, 2, 1]` or `[1, 1, 2, 1]`, which are not beautiful.
   - The program's logic does not account for the correct condition to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. It should consider the structure of the array and the operations allowed to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to disrupt the "beautiful" property.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Uniform Array Case:** The program correctly handles this scenario.
- **Non-Uniform Array Case:** The program's approach to find the smallest uniform subarray is insufficient and incorrect for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem for non-uniform arrays. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
