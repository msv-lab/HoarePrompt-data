Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `flag` is False, and the current element `arr[i]` is not equal to the previous element `arr[i - 1]`.**

The variable `flag` has been set to `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
