### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Initial Check for Uniformity**:
   - The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and setting a `flag` to `False` if it finds any two consecutive elements that are different.
   - If `flag` remains `True`, it means the array consists of identical elements, and it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements. In this case, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Finding Minimum Consecutive Sequence Length**:
   - If the array is not uniform, the program then calculates the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the same element.
   - It initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are the same.
   - When a different element is encountered, it updates `ans` with the minimum of its current value and the count of the previous sequence.
   - After the loop, it performs a final update of `ans` with the count of the last sequence.
   - The program then outputs the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the beauty of the array.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Approach**:
  - The approach of finding the minimum length of consecutive sequences does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.
  - The problem requires finding the smallest number of removals such that the remaining array cannot be made uniform by the described operation. This involves a more complex analysis of the array structure, not just the length of consecutive sequences.

- **Example Analysis**:
  - For the input `3 3 3 5 3 3 3`, the program would identify the minimum sequence length as `1` (the `5` in the middle). However, removing just one element (the `5`) does not make the array non-beautiful because the remaining array `3 3 3 3 3` can still be made uniform.
  - The correct approach would involve identifying the longest sequence of elements that can be made uniform and removing the elements outside this sequence.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It incorrectly assumes that the minimum length of consecutive sequences directly corresponds to the minimum number of removals required.

**Correctness: False**
