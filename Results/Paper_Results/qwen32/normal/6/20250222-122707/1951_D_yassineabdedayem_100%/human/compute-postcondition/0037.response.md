The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is: `print(1)`.
2. The number `1` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not referenced in the `print` statement.
4. Since the `print` statement directly outputs the number `1`, the output is straightforward and does not depend on any of the other variables.

Output: **1**
