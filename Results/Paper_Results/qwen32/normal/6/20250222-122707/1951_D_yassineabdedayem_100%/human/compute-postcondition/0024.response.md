To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it provides context).
2. `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
3. If `n` equals `k`, no further changes are made to `n` or `k`.
4. If `n` is not equal to `k`, the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is determined:
   - If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, that relationship holds.
   - Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement outputs the value of `n - k + 1` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- The value of `n - k + 1` depends on the specific values of `n` and `k`.

### Output Description:
- Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical output.
- However, we can describe the printed value in terms of the variables `n` and `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **n - k + 1 (where n and k are integers read from the input)**
