The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This does not affect the values of `n` and `k` directly, as they are mentioned to be part of the test cases themselves and are not initialized in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `n` and `k` are two positive integers (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}) for each test case.**
