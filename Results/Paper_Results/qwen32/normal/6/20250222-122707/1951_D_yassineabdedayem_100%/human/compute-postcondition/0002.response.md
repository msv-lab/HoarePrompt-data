The code snippet reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. Given the initial state, `t` is not affected by this operation, and `n` and `k` are updated to the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input.**
