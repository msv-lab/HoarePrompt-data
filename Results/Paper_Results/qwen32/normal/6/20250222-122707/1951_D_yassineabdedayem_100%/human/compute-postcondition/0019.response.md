The initial state describes a scenario where `t` is greater than 0, and `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. The relationship between `n` and `k` is evaluated, but the print statement in the code snippet does not depend on the outcome of this evaluation. The print statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement is independent of the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`. It will always print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
