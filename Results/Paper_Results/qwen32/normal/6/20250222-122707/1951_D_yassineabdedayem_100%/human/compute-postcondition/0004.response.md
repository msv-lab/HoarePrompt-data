The `print('YES')` statement will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` as long as they meet the initial conditions provided. The conditions state that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, and `n` and `k` are integers with `n` equal to `k`. However, these conditions do not affect the content of the print statement, which is a static string.

Output: **YES**
