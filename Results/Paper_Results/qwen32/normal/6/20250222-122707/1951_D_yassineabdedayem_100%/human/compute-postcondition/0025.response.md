The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`) and their relationships, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is not influenced by the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about `t`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print(1)`, which explicitly outputs the integer `1`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `1`.

Output: **1**
