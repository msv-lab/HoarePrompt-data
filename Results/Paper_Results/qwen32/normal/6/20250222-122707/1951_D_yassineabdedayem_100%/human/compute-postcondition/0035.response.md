The task involves analyzing a Python code snippet with a given initial state and determining the output of the `print` statement. In this case, the initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, and `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. However, the `print` statement is:

```python
print(2)
```

This statement directly prints the integer `2` and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, the output will be the number `2`.

Output: **2**
