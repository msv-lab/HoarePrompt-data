The given initial state describes several variables (`T`, `a`, `b`, and `i`), but the `print` statement in the code snippet is independent of these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Bob'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable Descriptions**:
   - `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print('Bob')` statement directly outputs the string `'Bob'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `T`, `a`, `b`, or `i`, the output will always be the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
