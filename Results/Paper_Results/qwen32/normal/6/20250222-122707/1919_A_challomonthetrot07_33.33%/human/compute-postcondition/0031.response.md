In the given initial state, the variable `T` represents the number of test cases, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, and `i` is incremented by 1. However, none of these variables are directly used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
2. `a` and `b` are integers, but their exact values are not specified.
3. `i` is incremented by 1, but this operation does not affect the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is `print('Alice')`, it will output the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of `T`, `a`, and `b`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **Alice**
