Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
2. `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
3. `i` is incremented by 1.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print('Bob')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'Bob' to the console.
- The variables `T`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string 'Bob' regardless of the values of `T`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Bob**
