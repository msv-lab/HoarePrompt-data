Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is not equal to 1, and `b` is not equal to 1. If `a` is odd, then `a` remains odd. If `a` is even, then `a` remains even, and if `a` is even and `b` is odd, `b` remains odd. Additionally, if `a` is greater than `b`, then the current value of `a` is greater than `b`; otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.**
