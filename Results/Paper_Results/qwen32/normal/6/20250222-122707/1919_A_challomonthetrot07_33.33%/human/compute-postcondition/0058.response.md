The loop processes `T` test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` and prints a result based on certain conditions. The loop iterates exactly `T` times, and after each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are read from the input and the result is printed.

After all iterations are complete, the loop variable `i` will have reached the value of `T`, and the values of `a` and `b` will reflect the last test case processed. The variable `T` itself remains unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases and is not modified within the loop.

Output State: **The loop has executed `T` times, with `i` equal to `T`. The values of `a` and `b` reflect the last test case processed. The variable `T` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, after all test cases are processed, the loop counter `i` will be equal to `T`, and `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last test case. The number of test cases `T` stays the same.
