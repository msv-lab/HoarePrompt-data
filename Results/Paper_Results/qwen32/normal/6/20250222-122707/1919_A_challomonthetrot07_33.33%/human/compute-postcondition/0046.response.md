To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
1. `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
2. `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
3. `i` is `i + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement directly outputs the string `'Alice'`.
- The variables `T`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state but are not used in the print statement.
- The value of `i` being `i + 1` does not affect the print statement because `i` is not referenced in the print statement.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of `T`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Output: **Alice**
