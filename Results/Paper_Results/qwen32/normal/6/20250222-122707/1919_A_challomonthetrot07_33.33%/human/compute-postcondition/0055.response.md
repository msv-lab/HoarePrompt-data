Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. If `b` equals 1, the specific actions within the if block are performed. Otherwise, `T`, `a`, and `b` retain their values as described, with `i` incremented by 1.**
