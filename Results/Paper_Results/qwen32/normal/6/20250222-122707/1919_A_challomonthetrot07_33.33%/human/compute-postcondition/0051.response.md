The given initial state describes several variables and an operation but does not provide specific values for `T`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Alice'. This statement does not depend on the values of `T`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `T` is the number of test cases.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and outputs the string 'Alice' regardless of the values of `T`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Output: **Alice**
