Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` is not equal to 1. If `b` is 1, then `b` remains 1. If `b` is not 1, `b` retains its value and its parity (odd or even) remains unchanged. If `a` is odd, `a` remains odd. If `a` is even, `a` remains even. Additionally, if `a` is greater than `b`, `a` remains greater than `b`; otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.**
