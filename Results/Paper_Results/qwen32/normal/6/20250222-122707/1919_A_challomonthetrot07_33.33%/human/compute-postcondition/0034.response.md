The given initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but it does not provide explicit values for `T`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of these variables.

Here's the code snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'Alice'`. The variables `T`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are not used in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Alice**
