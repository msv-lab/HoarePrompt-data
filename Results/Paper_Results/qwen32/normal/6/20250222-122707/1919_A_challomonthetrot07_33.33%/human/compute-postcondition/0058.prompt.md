Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000. The function receives two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) for each test case, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(T):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == b:
        print('Bob')
    elif a == 1:
        print('Alice')
    elif b == 1:
        print('Bob')
    elif a % 2 == 1:
        print('Bob')
    elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
        print('Alice')
    elif a > b:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a` is equal to `b`, their values remain unchanged. If `a` is not equal to `b`, their values and parities remain unchanged, and the relationship between `a` and `b` (whether `a` is greater than `b` or not) is preserved.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `T`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain consistent with the initial conditions regardless of whether `a` equals `b` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` equals `b`, no specific actions are performed within the if block. Otherwise, if `b` equals 1, specific actions within the else block are performed. In all cases, `T`, `a`, and `b` retain their values as described, with `i` incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
