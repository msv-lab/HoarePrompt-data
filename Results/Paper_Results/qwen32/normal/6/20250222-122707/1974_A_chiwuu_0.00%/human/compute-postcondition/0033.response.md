Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `t` is calculated as `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0` otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`**

In natural language: The value of `t2` is now calculated as `a - t1`. All other variables retain their initial states.
