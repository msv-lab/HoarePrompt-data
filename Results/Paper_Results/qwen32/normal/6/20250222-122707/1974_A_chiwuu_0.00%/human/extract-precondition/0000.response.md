Precondition: **The function `func` takes no input arguments but operates on multiple test cases provided through standard input. Each test case consists of two integers, x and y, where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively. The first line of input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which denotes the number of test cases that follow.**
