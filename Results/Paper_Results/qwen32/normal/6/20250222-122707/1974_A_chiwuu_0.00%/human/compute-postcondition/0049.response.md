The value of `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first value from the input split as an integer, `b` is the second value from the input split as an integer, `i` is 0, `t` is `(2 * b) // 5` if `(2 * b) % 5 == 0`; otherwise, `t` is `((2 * b) // 5) + 1`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`.**
