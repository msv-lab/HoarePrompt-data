The code converts the string `a` to an integer. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `b` remain unchanged. The new value of `a` is now an integer.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `a` is an integer (converted from the string `a`); `b` is a string representing the second part of the input**.
