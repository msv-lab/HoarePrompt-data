The code snippet `a, b = input().split()` takes an input string, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `a` and `b`. The previous values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this operation. Since the input is split into two parts, `a` and `b` will be strings representing the two parts of the input.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 â‰¤ x, y â‰¤ 99; `a` and `b` are strings representing the two parts of the input**.
