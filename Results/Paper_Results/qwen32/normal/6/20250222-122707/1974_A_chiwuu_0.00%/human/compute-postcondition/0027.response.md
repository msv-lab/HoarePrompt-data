The code snippet provided updates the value of `t` to be `b * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is not defined in the initial state and has not been changed.**
