Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99 for each test case.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    t = b * 2
    if t % 5 == 0:
        t = t // 5
    else:
        t = t // 5 + 1
    t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
    if t1 >= a:
        t = t
    else:
        t2 = a - t1
        if t2 % 15 == 0:
            t = t + t2 // 15
        else:
            t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
    print(t)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` and `b` are integers. `t` is calculated as `b * 2 // 5` if `b * 2` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`. `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the program remains in this state. Otherwise, `t` is updated by adding `t2 // 15` if `t2` (which is `a - t1`) is divisible by 15, or `t2 // 15 + 1` if not, and `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer. If `t1` (calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` where `t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0` otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`) is greater than or equal to `a`, then `i` is not defined. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, otherwise `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t2` is recalculated as `a - t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first value from the input split as an integer, `b` is the second value from the input split as an integer, `i` is 0. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains as `t * 15 - b * 4` where `t` is `(2 * b) // 5` if `(2 * b) % 5 == 0`; otherwise, `t` is `((2 * b) // 5) + 1`. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t2` is recalculated as `a - t1`, and `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`; otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. In both cases, `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
