Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer. If `t1` (calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` where `t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0` otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`) is greater than or equal to `a`, then `i` is not defined. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, otherwise `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`, `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t2` is recalculated as `a - t1`.**
