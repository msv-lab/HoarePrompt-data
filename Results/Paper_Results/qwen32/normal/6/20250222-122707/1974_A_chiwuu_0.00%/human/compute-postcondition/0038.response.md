To determine the exact value printed by the `print(t)` statement, we need to carefully follow the logic described in the initial state and the conditions provided.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Calculations:**
   - `t` is initially calculated as `(b * 2) // 5`. If `t % 5 == 0`, it remains the same; otherwise, it is incremented by 1.
   - `t1` is then calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.

2. **Conditional Check:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `i` is not defined, and the process ends without further updates to `t`.
   - If `t1 < a`, then `t` is updated:
     - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.
   - `t1` is recalculated with the new `t` as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - `t2` is recalculated as `a - t1`.

3. **Output:**
   - The final value of `t` after the above calculations is printed.

### Detailed Calculation:

Given the initial state:
- `n > 0`
- `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`
- `a` is the first input integer.
- `b` is the second input integer.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: `t1 >= a`
- `t` is calculated as `(b * 2) // 5` or `(b * 2) // 5 + 1` based on the condition `t % 5 == 0`.
- `t1` is then calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged, and the final printed value is this initial `t`.

#### Scenario 2: `t1 < a`
- `t` is updated based on the value of `t2`:
  - `t2 = a - t1`
  - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`.
  - Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.
- `t1` is recalculated with the new `t` as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `t2` is recalculated as `a - t1`.
- This process continues until `t1 >= a`, at which point `t` is the final printed value.

### Conclusion:

The final value of `t` depends on the initial values of `a` and `b` and the iterative process described. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `t`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the final value of `t` after the iterative adjustments.

Output: **t (where t is the final value after the iterative adjustments based on the conditions provided)**
