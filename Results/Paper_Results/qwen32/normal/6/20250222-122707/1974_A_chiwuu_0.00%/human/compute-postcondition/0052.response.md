Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first value from the input split as an integer, `b` is the second value from the input split as an integer, `i` is 0. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. In both cases, `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t2` is recalculated as `a - t1`.**
