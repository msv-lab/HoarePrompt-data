The value of `t` is updated to `t // 5`. Given that `t` was initially `2 * b`, the new value of `t` will be `(2 * b) // 5`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first value from the input split as an integer, `b` is the second value from the input split as an integer, `i` is 0, `t` is `(2 * b) // 5`**.
