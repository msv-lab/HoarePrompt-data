The code snippet provided modifies the value of `t` by adding the integer division of `t2` by 15 to it. Here's the calculation with the given initial state:

- `t` is initially calculated as `(2 * b) // 5` if `(2 * b) % 5 == 0`; otherwise, `t` is `((2 * b) // 5) + 1`.
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.

The code then updates `t` to `t + t2 // 15`.

Given these calculations, the new value of `t` is:

`new_t = t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15`

This can be simplified to:

`new_t = t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`

The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `i` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the updated value of `t`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first value from the input split as an integer, `b` is the second value from the input split as an integer, `i` is 0, `t` is `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`.**
