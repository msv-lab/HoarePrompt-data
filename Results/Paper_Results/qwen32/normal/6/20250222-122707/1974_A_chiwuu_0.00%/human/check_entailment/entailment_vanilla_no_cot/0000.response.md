Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to fit the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid. Here are some issues with the implementation:

1. The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons by dividing by 5, which is incorrect because a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, not 5. This means the calculation for `t` (the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons) is incorrect.

2. The logic for calculating the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons and then placing the 1x1 icons is flawed. The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` does not correctly determine the remaining space available for 1x1 icons.

3. The program does not account for the fact that a 2x2 icon cannot be placed in certain positions due to the grid constraints. For example, a 2x2 icon cannot be placed in the last column of any row because there is not enough space for the 2x2 icon to fit.

4. The program does not consider all possible configurations for placing the 1x1 and 2x2 icons to minimize the number of screens.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        screens = 0
        
        # Place 2x2 icons first
        while b > 0:
            # Try to place 2x2 icons in the current screen
            if b >= 3:
                # Place 3 2x2 icons in one screen
                screens += 1
                b -= 3
            elif b == 2:
                # Place 2 2x2 icons in one screen
                screens += 1
                b -= 2
                a -= 3  # 3 cells are left empty
            elif b == 1:
                # Place 1 2x2 icon in one screen
                screens += 1
                b -= 1
                a -= 7  # 7 cells are left empty
        
        # Place remaining 1x1 icons
        if a > 0:
            screens += (a + 14) // 15  # Each screen can hold 15 1x1 icons
        
        print(screens)

func()
```

This corrected version places the 2x2 icons first and then fills the remaining space with 1x1 icons, ensuring that the minimum number of screens is used.
