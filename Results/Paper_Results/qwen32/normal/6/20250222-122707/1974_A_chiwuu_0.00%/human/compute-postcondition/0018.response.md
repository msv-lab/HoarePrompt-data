Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `a` and `b` are integers (converted from the strings `a` and `b` respectively); `t` is calculated as `b * 2` divided by 5, rounding down if divisible by 5 or rounding down and adding 1 if not; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`; `t2` is calculated as `a - t1` and `t2` is not divisible by 15.**
