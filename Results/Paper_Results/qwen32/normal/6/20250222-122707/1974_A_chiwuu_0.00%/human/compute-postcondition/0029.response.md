The value of `t` is recalculated as `t // 5 + 1`. Given that `t` was initially `b * 2`, the new value of `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is not defined**.
