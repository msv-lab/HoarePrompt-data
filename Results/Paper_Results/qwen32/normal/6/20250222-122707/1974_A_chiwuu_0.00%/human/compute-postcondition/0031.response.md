The code snippet provided does not change the value of `t1` since `t1` is already defined in the initial state as `t * 15 - b * 4`. The line `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is essentially reassigning `t1` to the same expression it was initially defined by, which does not alter its value.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State with respect to the variables provided.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `t` is calculated as `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0` otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is not defined.**
