### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether the functions `func_1` and `func_2` together meet the requirements of the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To query the interactor with a degree `d` and receive a vertex `v` with a degree at least `d` and another vertex `u` not connected to `v`.
- **Behavior**: 
  - Prints the query `? d`.
  - Reads the response, which consists of two integers `v` and `u`.
  - Returns the tuple `(v, u)`.
- **Correctness**: This function correctly interacts with the interactor as described in the problem statement. It queries the interactor for a vertex with a degree at least `d` and correctly handles the response.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To find a Hamiltonian path in the original graph by using the `func_1` function to iteratively select vertices.
- **Behavior**:
  - Initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices of the Hamiltonian path.
  - Initializes a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from `1` to `n`.
  - Iteratively queries the interactor for vertices with decreasing degrees (`d` from `n-1` to `0`) until all vertices are included in the path.
  - If a valid vertex `v` is found (i.e., `v` is not `0` and is in `remaining_vertices`), it adds `v` to the `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.
  - Once all vertices are included in the path, it prints the path in the required format.
- **Correctness**: The function `func_2` attempts to construct a Hamiltonian path by selecting vertices with the highest possible degree first. However, it does not ensure that the selected vertices form a valid Hamiltonian path. Specifically, the function does not check if the selected vertices are connected in a way that forms a path. It simply appends vertices to the path as long as they are valid according to the interactor's response.

### Issue:
The main issue with `func_2` is that it does not ensure that the selected vertices form a valid Hamiltonian path. The function only checks if the vertices are valid according to the interactor's response but does not verify that they are connected in a way that forms a path. This means that the final path may not be a Hamiltonian path, even though it includes all vertices.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, the program is not guaranteed to find a Hamiltonian path as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
