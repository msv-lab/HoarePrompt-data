The code snippet removes the value of `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`. Therefore, `remaining_vertices` will no longer contain `v`, but all other conditions and values remain as specified.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the value of `v`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v` and the current value of `v`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, then the current value of `v` remains 0. The current value of `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` after the code execution.**

In simpler terms: `n` remains the same, `path` remains the same, `remaining_vertices` no longer includes `v`, `v` and `u` remain the same, and `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` after the code execution.
