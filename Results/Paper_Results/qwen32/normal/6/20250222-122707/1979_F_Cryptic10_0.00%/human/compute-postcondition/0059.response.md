The only variable in the loop head is `d`, which is the loop variable in the `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` expression. This means we need to adjust the state related to `d` for the loop to execute. The loop will execute if the range is non-empty, which depends on the value of `n`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where `2 <= n <= 10^5`, the range `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` will always be non-empty because `n - 1` will be at least `1` when `n` is at least `2`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` to ensure the loop executes.

However, we need to ensure that `d` starts at `n - 1` as the first value in the range. The variables `path` and `remaining_vertices` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `d` starts at `n - 1`, but since this is the initial state of the loop variable, we don't need to explicitly state it unless we are initializing it manually before the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex**
