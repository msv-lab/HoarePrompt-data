The given code snippet calls the function `func_1(d)` and assigns its return values to `v` and `u`. This means that after the function call, `v` and `u` will hold the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The value of `d` is decremented by 1 (`d = d - 1`), but since this operation is not within the provided code snippet, we will only consider the changes directly caused by the function call.

Given the initial state, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, it remains 0. If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, the loop or if statement would break, but since the break statement is not in the provided code snippet, we will not consider this aspect in the output state.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `v` and `u` as returned by `func_1(d)`, and the value of `d` will be `d - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing one or two elements, the original vertex, and optionally `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is no longer in the set; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 1`.**
