The code appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. The values of `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged unless `v` is 0, in which case the program proceeds without further changes to `v` or `u`. Since the code does not modify `d`, `v`, or `u` directly, only `path` is updated.

Output State: **`d` is `d + 1`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; `path` has `v` appended to it.**
