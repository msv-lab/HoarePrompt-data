Output State: **`d` is `d + 1`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; `path` has `v` appended to it; `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `d` remains `d + 1`, and the values of `v` and `u` are still the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The list `path` still has `v` appended to it. The list `remaining_vertices` no longer contains the value `v` after it was removed.
