To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop operates and how the variables `path` and `remaining_vertices` evolve.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop runs from `d = n - 1` down to `d = 0`.
- For each `d`, it calls `func_1(d)` to get `v` and `u`.
- If `v` is 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.
- If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is added to `path`, and `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. The loop then breaks, stopping further iterations.

### Key Points:
1. **Termination Condition**: The loop will terminate as soon as it finds a `v` that is in `remaining_vertices`.
2. **State After Termination**: 
   - `path` will contain exactly one element, which is the first `v` found in `remaining_vertices`.
   - `remaining_vertices` will have one element removed, which is the value of `v` added to `path`.

### Final Output State:
- Since the loop breaks as soon as it finds a valid `v`, it will run at most `n` times (if it has to check each `d`).
- The final state will have `path` with one element and `remaining_vertices` with `n-1` elements.

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop will continue to decrement `d` and call `func_1(d)` until it finds a `v` that is in `remaining_vertices`.
- Once such a `v` is found, it is added to `path`, and `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`.
- The loop then stops, and no further iterations occur.
- Therefore, the final state will have `path` containing exactly one vertex, and `remaining_vertices` will contain all other vertices except the one added to `path`.

### Final Output State in Required Format:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing one element, which is a vertex from the set of remaining vertices; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except the vertex in `path`.**
