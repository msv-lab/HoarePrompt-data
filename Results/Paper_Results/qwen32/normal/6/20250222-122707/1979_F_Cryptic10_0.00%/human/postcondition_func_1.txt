The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a graph, where `2 <= n <= 10^5`. It constructs a path by iteratively selecting vertices from the set of remaining vertices until all vertices are included in the path. The function then prints the path in the format `! [vertices in path separated by spaces]`.
