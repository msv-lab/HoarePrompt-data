Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing one or two elements, the original vertex, and optionally `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is no longer in the set; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 1`. If `v` is 0, the conditions remain as described. If `v` is not 0, there is no change to the described conditions.***
