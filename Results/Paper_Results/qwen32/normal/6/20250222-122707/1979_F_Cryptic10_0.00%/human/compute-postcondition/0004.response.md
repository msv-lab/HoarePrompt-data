To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1(d)` does and what values it returns. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we can only infer that it returns two values, `v` and `u`, based on the input `d`.

Given that the function `func_1(d)` returns two values, `v` and `u`, we can assume that these values are derived from the input `d` in some manner. However, without the specific implementation of `func_1`, we can't determine the exact values of `v` and `u`. We can only state that `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`.

The variables `n`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` are not affected by the execution of this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.
