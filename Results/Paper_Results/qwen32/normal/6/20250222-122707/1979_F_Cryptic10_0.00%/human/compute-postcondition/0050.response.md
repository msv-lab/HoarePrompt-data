The code snippet `v, u = func_1(d)` indicates that the function `func_1` is called with `d` as an argument, and it returns two values which are assigned to `v` and `u`. The initial state specifies that `d` has been decremented by 1 before this line of code is executed, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex. The variable `path` might have been updated to include `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, but this does not affect the current operation.

Since the specific behavior of `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of `v` and `u`. However, we can state that `v` and `u` will be assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The values of `n`, `remaining_vertices`, and the state of `path` remain unchanged unless `func_1` has side effects that modify them, which is not indicated in the problem statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex, and optionally `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex; `d` is now `d - 1`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.
