The only variable in the loop head is `d`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `d` is in the range from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `d` would have taken on the value of `n - 1`, `n - 2`, ..., and so on, decrementing by 1 each time.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `d` to the next value in the sequence. If `d` was `n - 1` at the end of the last iteration, it should be `n - 2` at the start of the next iteration. This pattern continues until `d` reaches `0`.

Given the loop runs from `n - 1` down to `0`, the state of `d` at the start of the next iteration should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` remains an empty list and `remaining_vertices` contains integers from 1 to n. If `v` is 0, the current value of `v` remains 0, `d` is `n - 2`**
