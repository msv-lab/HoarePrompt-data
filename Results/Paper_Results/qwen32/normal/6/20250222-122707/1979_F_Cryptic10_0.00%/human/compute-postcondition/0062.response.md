Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; the current value of `v` is 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of the code inside the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged.
