The only variable in the loop head is `d`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `n-1` down to `0` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, `d` was some value, and for the loop to execute again, `d` must be decremented by 1, provided it is still within the range.

Given that the loop runs from `n-1` down to `0`, if `d` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have terminated. Therefore, `d` must have been greater than `0` at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. `path` is a list containing one or two elements, the original vertex, and optionally `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is no longer in the set. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current value of `v` remains 0. If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `d` is `d - 1`**
