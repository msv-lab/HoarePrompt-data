The code snippet appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`.
- If `v` was initially 0, `d` is `n - 2`.
- `path` is a list containing the value of `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it remains an empty list.
- `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to n.

After executing `path.append(v)`, the list `path` will now include `v` as its last element.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`; if `v` was initially 0, `d` is `n - 2`; `path` is a list containing the value of `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains the value of `v` as its last element; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to n.**
