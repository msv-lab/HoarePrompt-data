Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and now also `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex except `v`; `d` is now `d - 1`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, no additional changes are made to the variables; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `d`, `v`, and `u` remain as specified in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
