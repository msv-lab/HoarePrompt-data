Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop, with `v` appended to it; `d` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. `remaining_vertices` no longer contains `v`.**

Natural Language: The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph. The `path` list still contains the original vertex and any additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop, with `v` appended to it. The value of `d` is still decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The values of `v` and `u` remain as the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The list `remaining_vertices` no longer contains the value `v` after it has been removed.
