The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. However, in the given context, there is no loop structure provided, so the `continue` statement does not affect the flow or the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing one element, which is a vertex from the set of remaining vertices; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; the current value of `v` is 0.**
