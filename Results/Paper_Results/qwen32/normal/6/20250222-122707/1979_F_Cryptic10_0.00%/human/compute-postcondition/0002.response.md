The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `remaining_vertices` is not empty. If `remaining_vertices` contains any elements, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5, `remaining_vertices` will always contain at least one element (specifically, it will contain elements from 1 to `n`).

Therefore, no adjustment is needed to ensure that the loop can execute the first time, as `remaining_vertices` is already guaranteed to be non-empty.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n**
