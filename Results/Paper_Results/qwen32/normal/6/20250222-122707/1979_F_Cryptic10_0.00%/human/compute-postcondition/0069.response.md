The only variable in the loop head is `d`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `d` was some value, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `d` is greater than or equal to `0`.

Given the loop statement `for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`, `d` is decremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `d` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

If at the end of the previous iteration, `d` was `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `d` should be `k - 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `d` at the end of the previous iteration, we can express the state in terms of the previous value of `d`.

However, we can make a general statement that if `d` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `d` should be `k - 1`. Given that the loop goes from `n - 1` to `0`, the next value of `d` should be one less than the previous value.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `d` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.** 

To be more specific, if `d` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `d` is `k - 1`.**

Since we don't know `k`, we can simply say:
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `d` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
