Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` was initially 0, `d` is `n - 2`. `path` is a list containing the value of `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it remains an empty list. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to n.**
