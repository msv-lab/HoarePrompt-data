### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem requirements to determine if the code is correct.

The goal is to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers.

#### Key Points:
1. **Sum Condition**: The sum of the integers in the sequence should be equal to `k`.
2. **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR**: To maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR, it is beneficial to use numbers that have as many 1s in their binary representation as possible.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Single Element Case (`n == 1`)**:
   - The code correctly handles the case when `n == 1` by simply outputting `k` because there's only one number, and it must be `k` to satisfy the sum condition.

2. **Multiple Elements Case (`n > 1`)**:
   - The code uses a function `func_1` to determine the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` by counting the number of bits in `k` minus one.
   - It then sets the first element of the array to `2 ** counter - 1`, which is the highest possible number with `counter` bits set to 1.
   - The second element is set to `k - arr[-1]` to ensure the sum of the array is `k`.
   - The remaining elements are set to 0, which does not affect the bitwise OR.

#### Issues:
- **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR**: The current approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. For example, if `k` is a power of 2, the code will set the first element to `k - 1` and the second element to `1`, which is not optimal. A better approach would be to distribute the 1s more evenly across the numbers.
- **Edge Cases**: The code does not consider edge cases where `k` is very small compared to `n`, e.g., `n = 5, k = 2`. The current approach would set the first element to `1` and the second element to `1`, and the rest to `0`, which is suboptimal.

#### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the code does not always produce a sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the code is not correct based on the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
