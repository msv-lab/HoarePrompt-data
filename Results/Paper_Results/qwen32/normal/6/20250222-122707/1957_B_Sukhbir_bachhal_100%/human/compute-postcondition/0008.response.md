The code snippet `n >>= 1` performs a right bitwise shift operation on the variable `n`, effectively dividing `n` by 2 and discarding any remainder (integer division by 2).

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `position` is 1

After executing `n >>= 1`, the value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 50000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `position` is 1.**
