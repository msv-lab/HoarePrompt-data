Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Indentation Error**: The `if` and `else` statements are not properly indented to be inside the `for` loop. This means that the program will only check the condition for the last test case and print the result `t` times.
2. **Output Formatting**: The output should be either "Alice" or "Bob" without any trailing spaces.
3. **Logic Error**: The logic for determining the winner is incorrect. The game is won by the player who can force the other player into a position where they cannot make a move. This happens when the sum of coins `(a + b)` is odd, as Alice (the first player) can always force a win in this scenario. Conversely, if `(a + b)` is even, Bob can always force a win.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This corrected program reads each test case, checks the sum of coins, and correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum.
