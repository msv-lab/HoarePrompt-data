### Reasoning:

The provided code has a logical flaw in its implementation. The code correctly reads the input values for the number of test cases and the respective values of `a` and `b` for each test case. However, the logic for determining the winner is incorrect.

The code prints "bob" if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and "alice" if the sum of `a` and `b` is odd. This approach does not align with the optimal strategy for the game described in the problem.

The correct strategy is based on the observation that if the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice can always win by ensuring that she leaves an even number of coins for Bob after each of her turns. Conversely, if the total number of coins is even, Bob can always win by ensuring that he leaves an odd number of coins for Alice after each of his turns.

However, the provided code incorrectly swaps the labels for "Alice" and "Bob" based on the parity of the sum. It should print "Alice" if the sum is odd and "Bob" if the sum is even.

### Correctness:

Given the incorrect logic in the code, the output will not match the expected results for the test cases.

**Correctness: False**
