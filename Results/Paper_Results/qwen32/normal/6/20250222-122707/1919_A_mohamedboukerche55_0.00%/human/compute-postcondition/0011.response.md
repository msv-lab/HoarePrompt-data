The code snippet updates the value of `b` by converting the second word in the string `s` to an integer. The values of `s`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is the new string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first word in the string `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second word in the string `s`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
