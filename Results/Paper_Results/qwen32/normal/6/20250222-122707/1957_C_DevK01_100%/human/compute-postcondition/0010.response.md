To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop:

The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = n`, and in each iteration, it updates the list `dp` as follows:
1. It appends a new value to `dp` calculated using the formula: `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
2. It removes the first element of `dp` using `dp.pop(0)`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `dp = [1, 3]`
- After 2 iterations: `dp = [3, 7]`
- After 3 iterations: `dp = [7, 57]`

We can infer the pattern and compute the final state for any `n`.

Let's compute the state step-by-step for a general `n`:

- After 1 iteration: `dp = [1, 3]`
- After 2 iterations: `dp = [3, 7]`
- After 3 iterations: `dp = [7, 57]`
- After 4 iterations: `dp = [57, (57 + 2 * 3 * 7) % (7 + 10 ** 9)] = [57, (57 + 42) % (7 + 10 ** 9)] = [57, 99]`
- After 5 iterations: `dp = [99, (99 + 2 * 4 * 57) % (7 + 10 ** 9)] = [99, (99 + 456) % (7 + 10 ** 9)] = [99, 555]`
- And so forth...

Since `dp` always keeps the last two computed values, the final state after `n` iterations will be `[dp[-2], dp[-1]]` where `dp[-1]` is the value computed in the last iteration.

To compute the final state for any `n`, we can use the loop as provided. However, the problem asks for the final state in terms of a general formula or the final values after `n` iterations.

Given the pattern, we can see that the final state after `n` iterations will be `[dp[n-1], dp[n]]` where `dp[n]` is the value computed in the last iteration.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **[dp[n-1], dp[n]]**

However, to provide a concrete example, let's compute the final state for a specific `n`. For simplicity, let's assume `n = 5`:

- After 1 iteration: `dp = [1, 3]`
- After 2 iterations: `dp = [3, 7]`
- After 3 iterations: `dp = [7, 57]`
- After 4 iterations: `dp = [57, 99]`
- After 5 iterations: `dp = [99, 555]`

So, the final state for `n = 5` is `[99, 555]`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations for a general `n` can be described as:

Output State: **[dp[n-1], dp[n]]**

For a specific example with `n = 5`, the output state is:

Output State: **[99, 555]**

However, since the problem asks for the final state in a general form, we describe it as:

Output State: **[dp[n-1], dp[n]]**
