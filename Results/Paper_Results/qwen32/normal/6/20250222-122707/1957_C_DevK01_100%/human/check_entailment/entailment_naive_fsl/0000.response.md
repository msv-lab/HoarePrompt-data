Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the number of different final configurations of the rooks on the chessboard. Let's analyze the program and the problem description to identify the issue.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the chessboard) and `k` (number of moves already played).
   - It then reads the `k` moves and updates `n` based on whether the move is diagonal or not.

2. **Updating `n`**:
   - If a move is not diagonal (i.e., `a != b`), it decreases `n` by 2 because both the row and column are occupied.
   - If a move is diagonal (i.e., `a == b`), it decreases `n` by 1 because only one position is occupied.

3. **Computing the Number of Configurations**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` is supposed to compute the number of configurations for the remaining `n` positions.
   - The function uses dynamic programming to compute this value, but the formula used in the dynamic programming step seems incorrect.

### Issues with the Dynamic Programming Formula

The dynamic programming formula used in `func_1(n)` is:
```python
dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
```

This formula does not correctly represent the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on the remaining `n` positions. The correct formula should account for the fact that each remaining position can be either empty or occupied by a rook in a way that no two rooks attack each other.

### Correct Formula

The correct formula for the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` board is the number of permutations of `n` items, which is `n!` (n factorial). However, since the problem is more complex due to the mirroring and diagonal moves, the correct approach involves more sophisticated combinatorial mathematics, specifically the use of derangements and other combinatorial structures.

### Conclusion

Given the incorrect dynamic programming formula, the program does not correctly compute the number of different final configurations for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Example of Incorrectness

Consider the test case:
```
1
4 1
1 2
```
The program would update `n` to 2 (since the move is not diagonal) and then compute the number of configurations for a 2x2 board using the incorrect dynamic programming formula. The correct number of configurations for a 2x2 board after one move is 3, but the program would likely give a different result.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
