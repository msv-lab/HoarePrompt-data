Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Recap:
1. **Chessboard**: An n x n chessboard.
2. **Players**: You and the computer take turns placing rooks.
3. **Rules**:
   - You place white rooks.
   - The computer places black rooks at the mirrored position (c, r) unless r = c, in which case it skips its turn.
   - No two rooks can attack each other (share the same row or column).
4. **Objective**: Determine the number of different final configurations after k moves (with the computer's implied moves) until no more valid moves are possible.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the board) and `k` (number of moves already made).
   - It then reads `k` pairs `(r, c)` representing your moves.

2. **Processing Moves**:
   - For each move `(r, c)`, it checks if `r != c`.
     - If true, it subtracts 2 from `n` because both the row and column are blocked.
     - If false, it subtracts 1 from `n` because only one position (the diagonal) is blocked.
   - This logic is correct because placing a rook at `(r, c)` blocks the entire row `r` and column `c` for future moves, except when `r == c`, which blocks only one position.

3. **Calculating Configurations**:
   - After processing all moves, the remaining `n` represents the number of free rows or columns.
   - The function `func_1(n)` is called to compute the number of configurations.
   - `func_1(n)` uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining `n` rows/columns.
   - The dynamic programming formula used is `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` which correctly counts the number of ways to place rooks in `i` rows/columns without them attacking each other.

4. **Output**:
   - The result of `func_1(n)` is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) for each test case.

### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1(n)` computes the number of ways to place rooks in `n` rows/columns without them attacking each other using the formula `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Validation:
- The function `func_1(n)` is correctly implemented to compute the number of configurations using dynamic programming.
- The logic for processing the moves and calculating the remaining `n` is correct.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, processes the moves according to the rules, and computes the number of configurations using the correct dynamic programming approach. The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Final Answer:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is correct.

Final: **True**
