Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Modulo Calculation**: The modulo value used in the `func_1` function is incorrect. The modulo should be `10**9 + 7` instead of `7 + 10**9`.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1(n)` is called before it is defined in the code, which will result in a `NameError`.

3. **Logic for Remaining Free Positions**: The logic for reducing `n` based on the moves played is correct, but the function `func_1(n)` does not correctly compute the number of possible final configurations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp.append((dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % MOD)
    return dp[-1]

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])
    for j in range(k):
        L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])
        if a != b:
            n -= 2
        else:
            n -= 1
    print(func_1(n))
```

This corrected version ensures that the modulo is correctly applied and that the function `func_1` is defined before it is called. The logic for reducing `n` based on the moves is also preserved.
