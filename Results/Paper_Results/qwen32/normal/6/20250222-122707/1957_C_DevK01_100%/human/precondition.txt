The function `sol` is intended to take a single integer `n` as input, but based on the problem description, it seems the function should actually take multiple inputs per test case. Specifically, for each test case, the function should receive two integers `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5` and `0 ≤ k ≤ n`, followed by `k` lines of two integers `r_i` and `c_i` each, representing the moves made. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 · 10^5`.
