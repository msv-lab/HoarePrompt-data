Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is defined as `t - 1`. However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore this for our current task.
- `n` is an input integer. The value of `n` is not directly relevant to the print statement.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(nums[0] + nums[1])
```

### Analysis:
- `nums` is sorted in descending order. This means the largest element is at index 0, and the second largest element is at index 1.
- The print statement adds the first element (`nums[0]`) and the second element (`nums[1]`) of the `nums` list.

### Output:
Since `nums` is sorted in descending order, `nums[0]` is the largest number, and `nums[1]` is the second largest number in the list. The print statement will output the sum of these two numbers.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest number and nums[1] is the second largest number in the sorted list `nums`)**
