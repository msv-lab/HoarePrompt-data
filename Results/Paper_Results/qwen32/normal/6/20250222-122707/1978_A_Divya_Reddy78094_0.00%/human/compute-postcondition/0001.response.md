The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. However, since the problem states that `1 <= t <= 500`, the loop will naturally execute as long as `t` is within this range.

Thus, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as the given condition for `t` already ensures that the loop will run. The loop variable `_` does not need to be initialized or adjusted because it is not used within the loop body.

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 500**
