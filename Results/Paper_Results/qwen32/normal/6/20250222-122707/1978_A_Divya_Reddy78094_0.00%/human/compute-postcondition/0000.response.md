The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. After executing the code, `t` will hold the value of the integer input provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
