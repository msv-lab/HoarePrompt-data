The code snippet reassigns `nums` to a new list of integers that are input by the user and split by spaces. This means the previous state of `nums` (which was a list of integers sorted in descending order) is replaced with the new list provided by the user.

The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**
