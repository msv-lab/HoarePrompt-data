The code `n = int(input())` will reassign the variable `n` with a new integer value provided by the user input. The other variables `t` and `nums` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input statement.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**

In natural language: The variable `n` has been reassigned to a new integer value provided by the user. The variable `t` remains as `t - 1`, and `nums` remains a list of integers sorted in descending order.
