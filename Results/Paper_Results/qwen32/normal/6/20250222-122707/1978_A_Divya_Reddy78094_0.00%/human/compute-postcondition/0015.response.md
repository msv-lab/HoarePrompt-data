To determine the output of the print statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: The variable `t` is mentioned, but it is not used in the code snippet provided, so it does not affect the output.
2. **`n`**: This is a new input integer, which means its value is not explicitly given but will be provided at runtime.
3. **`nums`**: This is a list of integers derived from the new input integer `n` and sorted in descending order. The exact list cannot be determined without knowing the value of `n`, but we know it is sorted in descending order.

### Code Snippet:
The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(nums[0] + nums[1])
```

### Analysis:
- `nums[0]`: This is the first element of the list `nums`, which, since the list is sorted in descending order, will be the largest integer in the list.
- `nums[1]`: This is the second element of the list `nums`, which will be the second largest integer in the list.

The print statement adds these two largest integers in the list and prints the result.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `n` and the derived list `nums` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`. However, we know that `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` are the two largest integers in the list `nums`, and the print statement will output their sum.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest and nums[1] is the second largest integer in the sorted list `nums`)**
