The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, and `n` is an integer, but the value of `n` is not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
