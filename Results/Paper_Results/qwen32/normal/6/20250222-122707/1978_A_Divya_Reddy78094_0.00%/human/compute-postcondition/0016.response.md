Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the last input and sorted in descending order.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times and decrements `t` implicitly with each iteration. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last `n` input, and `nums` will be the list of integers from the last input, sorted in descending order. The loop will have printed the sum of the two largest integers from each input list during its execution.
