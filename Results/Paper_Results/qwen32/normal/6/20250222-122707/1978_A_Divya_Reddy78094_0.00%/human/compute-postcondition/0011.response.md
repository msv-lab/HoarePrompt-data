The only variable in the loop head is `t`, as the loop is defined using `for _ in range(t)`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given that `t` is `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be `t - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `t`.

However, to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration before the decrement happens, `t` should be `t`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
