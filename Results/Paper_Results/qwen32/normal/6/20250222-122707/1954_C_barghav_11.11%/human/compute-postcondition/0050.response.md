Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `a` is printed out.
2. `i` equals `len(b) - 1`.
3. All elements of `b` are printed concatenated together.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print()
```

### Analysis:
The `print()` statement in Python, when called without any arguments, outputs a newline character by default.

### Variables:
- `a`: It is mentioned that `a` is printed out, but there is no print statement in the given code that actually prints `a`. This information seems to be extraneous for the given print statement.
- `i`: It is defined as `len(b) - 1`, but `i` is not used in the provided print statement.
- `b`: All elements of `b` are printed concatenated together, but again, this information is not relevant to the provided print statement.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided `print()` statement does not have any arguments, it will simply print a newline character.

### Output:
Output: **(newline)**
