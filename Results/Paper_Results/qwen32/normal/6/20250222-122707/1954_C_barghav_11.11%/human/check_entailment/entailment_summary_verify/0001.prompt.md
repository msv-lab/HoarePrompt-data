You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n
            b[i] = m
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
    print()
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `y` as strings, processes them by rearranging their digits such that the first half of the first number consists of the maximum digits and the second half consists of the minimum digits compared to the corresponding digits of the second number, and vice versa for the second number. It then prints the modified versions of both numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to maximize the product of two integers `x` and `y` by swapping corresponding digits between them. However, the logic in the provided program does not correctly achieve this goal. Specifically, the program does not implement a strategy that ensures the product of `x` and `y` is maximized.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Swapping Logic**:
   - The program swaps the digits in the first half of the numbers to always make the digits in `x` larger and the digits in `y` smaller.
   - For the second half, it does the opposite, making the digits in `x` smaller and the digits in `y` larger.
   - This logic does not necessarily maximize the product. The optimal strategy involves comparing all pairs of digits and making decisions based on their values to maximize the product.

2. **Lack of Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program does not consider the overall effect of swapping on the product of the two numbers. It only considers local decisions (swapping individual pairs of digits).
   - An optimal approach would involve sorting the digits of `x` and `y` in a way that maximizes the product, which is not done in the provided program.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the test case:
```
x = 3516
y = 3982
```
The provided program would output:
```
3912
3586
```
However, a better solution would be:
```
3986
3512
```
This results in a higher product compared to the output from the provided program.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y`. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
