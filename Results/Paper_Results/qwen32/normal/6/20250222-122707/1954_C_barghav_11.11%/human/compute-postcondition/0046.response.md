Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `a` is printed out (though `a` is not used in the provided print statement).
2. `i` is set to 0.
3. `b` is a list with at least one element.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```

### Analysis:
- `i` is explicitly set to 0.
- `b` is a list with at least one element. This means `b[0]` is a valid element in the list.
- The `print` statement will output the element at index `i` of the list `b`. Since `i` is 0, this means the output will be `b[0]`.
- The `end=''` parameter in the `print` statement means that no newline character will be added after the printed value.

### Output:
The output will be the first element of the list `b`.

Output: **b[0] (where b[0] is the first element of the list `b`)**
