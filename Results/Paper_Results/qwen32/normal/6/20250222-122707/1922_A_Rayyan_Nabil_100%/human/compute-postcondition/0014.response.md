The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`n` is the new integer value of the user input, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing two elements which are the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` called twice.**
