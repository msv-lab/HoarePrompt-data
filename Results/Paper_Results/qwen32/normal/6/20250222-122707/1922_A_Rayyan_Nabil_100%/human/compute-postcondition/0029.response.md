Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` (where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20 inclusive). It then processes these strings using `func_1` and prints the result for each test case.**
