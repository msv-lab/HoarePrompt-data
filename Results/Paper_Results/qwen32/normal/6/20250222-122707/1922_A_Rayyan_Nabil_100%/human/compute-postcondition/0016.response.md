The code snippet `a = input().strip()` takes a new input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `a`. This means the value of `a` is now whatever new string the user provides. The other variables (`n`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new integer value of the user input, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing two elements which are the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` called twice.**
