The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`, which is being iterated over from the `results` list. Since the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list, in order for the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the `results` list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `results` contains only one element. To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to add another element to the `results` list. However, since we are only allowed to adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we cannot directly modify the `results` list. Instead, we need to assume that the `results` list has been modified externally to include an additional element.

State: **`n` is the integer value of the last user input, `a` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing 2 elements, where the first element is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` and the second element is the result of another call to `func_1(n, a, b, c)` or some other value**.

Since we can't directly modify `results`, we'll assume that `results` has been updated to contain another element for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is the integer value of the last user input, `a` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing 2 elements**.
