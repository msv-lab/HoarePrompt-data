The code snippet updates the value of `c` by reading a new string input from the user and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new integer value of the user input, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
