Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the last user input, `a` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing `t` elements which are the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` called `t` times.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last iteration's user input. The variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has executed `t` times and is now finished. The `results` list will contain the results of calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the `t` iterations.
