You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` (where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20 inclusive). It then processes these strings using `func_1` and prints the result for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if there is at least one position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this is not sufficient to determine if there exists a template `t` such that both `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.

The correct logic should be to check if, for each position `i`, the conditions for the template can be satisfied:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then the template character at position `i` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), and `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]`.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then the template character at position `i` can be either the uppercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and `c[i]` must not match the chosen template character.

Here is a counterexample where the provided program fails:

Input:
```
1
2
ab
ba
aa
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Explanation:
- For the first character, `a[0] = 'a'` and `b[0] = 'b'`. We can choose the template character as 'A' (uppercase 'a'), so `a[0]` and `b[0]` match the template, but `c[0] = 'a'` does not.
- For the second character, `a[1] = 'b'` and `b[1] = 'a'`. We can choose the template character as 'B' (uppercase 'b'), so `a[1]` and `b[1]` match the template, but `c[1] = 'a'` does not.

However, the provided program will return "NO" for this input because it only checks if there is at least one position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, which is not the correct condition to determine the existence of a valid template.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case, and the Correctness is **False**.
