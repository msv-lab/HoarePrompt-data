### Reasoning:
The program is designed to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template while string `c` does not. The template string `t` can have both lowercase and uppercase letters, with specific rules for matching:

- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be the same as the i-th letter of the template.
- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th letter of the template.

The function `func_1` checks if there exists at least one position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it means we can create a template where `a` and `b` match the template at that position (by using an uppercase letter in the template), while `c` does not match the template (since `c[i]` would be the same as the lowercase version of the template letter).

The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calls `func_1` to determine if a valid template exists for each test case and stores the results. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Given the logic in `func_1`, it correctly checks if there is at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns "YES", indicating that a valid template can be constructed. If no such position exists for all `i`, it returns "NO".
