Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `hd - 1`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` (or `abs(a1 - a2)` based on the condition in the loop body); `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values and states.
