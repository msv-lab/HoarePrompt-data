Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` (which is initially `a1 - a2`) is decremented by 1 if `hd` is greater than 0 and `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`; `res` is either `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` or `abs(a1 - a2)` based on the condition in the loop body, and `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
