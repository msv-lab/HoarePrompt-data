Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are the new input strings, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1` if `hd` was originally greater than 0, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`, and `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`. Additionally, `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.**
