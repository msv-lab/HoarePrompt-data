The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop structure in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the program state. Therefore, none of the variables will be changed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` is the string input; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`; `i` is 0**
