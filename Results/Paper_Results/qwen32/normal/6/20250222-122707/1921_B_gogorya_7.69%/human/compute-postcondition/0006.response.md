The code snippet assigns `a2` the count of '1's in the string `s2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, and `a1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s1` is the string input; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`.**
