The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables or the conditions outside of the loop. Since the provided code snippet does not contain any loop structure, the `continue` statement has no effect in this context. Therefore, none of the variables will be changed by this statement.

Given that there are no changes to the variables, the output state will be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` is the string input; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 2` if `hd` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `hd` is `-1`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`; `i` is 1.**
