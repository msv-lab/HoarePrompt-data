Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s` and `f` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' only. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of an input integer, and the constraints on `t`, `n`, `s`, and `f` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
