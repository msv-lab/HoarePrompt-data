The code snippet `hd -= 1` decrements the value of `hd` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` is the string input; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 2` if `hd` was initially greater than 0, otherwise `hd` is `-1`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`; `i` is 1. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `res` is incremented by 1.**
