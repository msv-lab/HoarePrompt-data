Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` is the string input; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If `hd` was initially greater than 0, then `hd` is now `a1 - a2 - 3`; otherwise, `hd` is `-1`. If `s1[2]` is '1' and `s2[2]` is '0', `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 3`; otherwise, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`. `i` is 2.**
