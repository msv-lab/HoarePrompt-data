The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Given that `res` was initially set to `abs(a1 - a2)`, after this operation, `res` becomes `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` is the string input; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2` if `hd` is not greater than 0, otherwise `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`; `i` is 0. At this point, `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.**
