To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which in this case is controlled by the variable `j` and the range `n - 1`.

The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2. The variable `j` will start at 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n - 1`.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to adjust only the variable `n` to ensure the loop can execute. The other variables (`ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `cn`, `r`, `f`, `num`) are not directly controlled by the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to begin executing.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` is 0**
