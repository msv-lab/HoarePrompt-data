Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`.**
