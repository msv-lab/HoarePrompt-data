The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the value `n - max(cn, ck)`, where `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of the list that consists of identical elements, and `ck` is the length of the longest prefix of the reversed list that consists of identical elements. If all elements in the list are the same, it prints `0`.
