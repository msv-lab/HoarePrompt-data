Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `cn` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from `num[0]` up to `num[n-2]` if all are equal, otherwise the count of consecutive equal elements until the first inequality is found, `ck` is 1, `i` is `n - 2` if all elements are equal, otherwise the index where the inequality is found, and `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]`**
