Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, and `f` is 1.**

Explanation: The condition `n == 1 or f == 1` is checked, but since the else part is absent, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition regardless of whether the condition is true or false.
