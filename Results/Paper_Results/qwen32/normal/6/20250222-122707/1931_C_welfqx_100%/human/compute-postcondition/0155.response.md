The code snippet `symb2 = onum[0]` assigns the first element of the reversed list `onum` to the variable `symb2`. Since `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, the first element of `onum` is the last element of `num`. Therefore, `symb2` will now hold the same value as the last element of `num`.

The initial state specifies that `symb2` is the last element of `num`, so after executing the code, `symb2` remains the last element of `num`, which is consistent with its initial description.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is the input integer and is either 1 or `f` is 1; `num` is a list of integers from the input; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is 1; `cn` is 1; `r` is the initial value of `r` plus the number of iterations completed by the loop.**
