The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` must be at least 2. Since we are moving to the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` becomes 2. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be at least 3 (since `j` needs to be less than `n - 1`).

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `j` is 2**
