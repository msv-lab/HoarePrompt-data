Output State: **`f` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `num` is a list of integers from the input, `onum` is the reversed list of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `r` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the values of the variables remain unchanged except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
