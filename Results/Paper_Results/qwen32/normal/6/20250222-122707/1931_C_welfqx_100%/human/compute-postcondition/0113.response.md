Postcondition: **`f` is 1; `n` is greater than 1; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, `ck` is 2, otherwise `ck` is 1. `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. If `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
