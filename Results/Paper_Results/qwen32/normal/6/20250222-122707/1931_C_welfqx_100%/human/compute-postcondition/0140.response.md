The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`f` is 0 if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, otherwise `f` remains unchanged, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `num` is a list of integers from the input, `onum` is the reversed list of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `r` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, and `j` is 2**
