### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum cost (in burles) to make all elements of an array equal using at most one operation that can change a contiguous subarray to a specified value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray.

The provided solution attempts to solve this problem by checking the longest contiguous subarray of identical elements from the start and the end of the array. If the identical elements at the start and end match, it combines their lengths. The result is then calculated as `n - max(cn, ck)`, where `cn` is the length of the longest prefix of identical elements starting from the beginning, and `ck` is the length of the longest prefix of identical elements starting from the end (after reversing the array).

Let's analyze the correctness of the solution:

1. **Single Element Array (n == 1):**
   - If the array has only one element, no operation is needed, so the cost is `0`. The solution correctly handles this case.

2. **All Elements Identical:**
   - If all elements in the array are identical, no operation is needed, so the cost is `0`. The solution correctly handles this case by checking if `f == 1` (indicating all elements are identical).

3. **General Case:**
   - The solution calculates `cn` and `ck` to determine the longest contiguous subarrays of identical elements from the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - If the elements at the start and end match, it combines their lengths.
   - The result is calculated as `n - max(cn, ck)`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the entire array identical.

However, the solution does not account for cases where the optimal solution involves changing an internal subarray that is not at the start or end. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`. The longest contiguous subarrays of identical elements from the start and end are both of length `1`, resulting in a calculated cost of `5 - max(1, 1) = 4`. However, the optimal solution would be to change the middle `3` to `2` or `1`, resulting in a cost of `1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases, particularly those where the optimal subarray to change is not at the start or end of the array. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

### Correctness:
