The code `ck += 1` increments the value of `ck` by 1. Given the initial state, `ck` is initially 1, so after the increment, `ck` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is 2; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. The current element at index `ii` of `onum` is equal to the element at index `ii + 1` of `onum`.**
