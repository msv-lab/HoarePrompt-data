To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `f` is set to 1.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `num` is a list of integers from the input.
4. `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`.
5. `symb1` is the first element of `num`.
6. `symb2` is the last element of `num`.
7. `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.
8. `r` is the initial value of `r` (which is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it here) plus `(n - 1)`.
9. `ck` is the count of the longest sequence of consecutive equal elements starting from `onum[0]`.
10. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is updated to the sum of the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num` and the count of the longest sequence of consecutive equal elements starting from `onum[0]`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is `print(n - max(cn, ck))`.

To understand what is printed, we need to determine the values of `cn` and `ck`:
- `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`.
- `ck` is the count of the longest sequence of consecutive equal elements starting from `onum[0]` (which is the same as the last element of `num`).

If `symb1` (first element of `num`) is equal to `symb2` (last element of `num`), then `cn` is updated to the sum of `cn` and `ck`.

### Calculation:
- If `symb1` is not equal to `symb2`, the print statement will output `n - max(cn, ck)`.
- If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is updated to `cn + ck`, and the print statement will output `n - (cn + ck)`.

### Final Output:
Based on the given information, the output of the print statement will be `n - max(cn, ck)` or `n - (cn + ck)` depending on whether `symb1` is equal to `symb2`.

Output: **n - max(cn, ck) (where cn is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num, and ck is the count of the longest sequence of consecutive equal elements starting from onum[0], and if symb1 is equal to symb2, cn is updated to cn + ck)**
