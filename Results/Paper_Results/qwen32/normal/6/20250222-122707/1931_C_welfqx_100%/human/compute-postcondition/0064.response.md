The only variable in the loop head is `r`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop will execute as long as `r` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `r` would have been incremented by 1, so for the loop to execute again, `r` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that the loop variable `r` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we simply need to increase `r` by 1 to prepare for the next iteration.

State: **`ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from `onum[0]` up to `onum[n-2]` if all are equal, otherwise the count of consecutive equal elements until the first inequality is found. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is the previous value of `cn` plus `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains unchanged, `r` is the current value of `r` plus 1**
