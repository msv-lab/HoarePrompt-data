### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of an array equal by performing at most one operation of assigning a value to a subarray. However, the logic implemented in `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum number of burles required for this task.

Here is an analysis of the logic in `func_1`:

1. **Initialization and Trimming Equal Ends**:
   - The function starts by initializing two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then moves these pointers towards each other as long as the elements at these pointers are equal. This step effectively trims the equal elements from both ends of the array.

2. **Checking for Uniform Array**:
   - If `i` surpasses `j`, it means the entire array was uniform, and the function returns `0` because no operation is needed.

3. **Handling Non-Uniform Array**:
   - If the array is not uniform, the function then checks if there are consecutive equal elements starting from `i` and increments `i` until it finds a different element.
   - After this, it checks if `j` is not at the last position of the array. If not, it returns `j - i + 1`, which is the length of the subarray from `i` to `j`.
   - If `j` is at the last position, it returns `j - i`.

The logic above does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles required to make all elements equal. The function seems to be attempting to find the longest contiguous subarray where at least two consecutive elements are different, but this does not necessarily give the minimum cost operation.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

- We can make all elements equal by selecting the most frequent element in the array. The cost will be the length of the array minus the count of the most frequent element.
- If we can make all elements equal by selecting a subarray, we need to find the minimum cost of such an operation.

The provided function does not implement this logic correctly, and thus, it will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
