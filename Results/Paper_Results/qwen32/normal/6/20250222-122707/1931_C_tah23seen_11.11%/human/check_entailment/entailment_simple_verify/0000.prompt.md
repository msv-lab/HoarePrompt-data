You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal in all cases. Let's analyze the logic of the provided code and find a counterexample.

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by finding the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are equal and then calculating the cost of making the remaining middle part uniform. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible ways to make the entire array uniform with a single operation.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation of Expected Output:
The optimal way to make the array uniform is to change the middle element to either 1 or 2, which will cost 1 burle. Alternatively, changing the middle three elements to 2 or 1 will also cost 3 burles. The minimum cost is 2 burles.

However, the provided code will output 4 for this input. Here's why:

1. The code will first find the longest prefix and suffix that are equal, which in this case are both `[1]`.
2. Then, it will calculate the cost of making the middle part uniform, which is `j - i + 1 = 4 - 1 + 1 = 4`.

This is clearly incorrect because the minimum cost should be 2 burles, not 4.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
