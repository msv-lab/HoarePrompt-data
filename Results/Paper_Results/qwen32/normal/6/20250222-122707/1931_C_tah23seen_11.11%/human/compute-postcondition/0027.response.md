To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is a valid index such that `i + 1` is also a valid index.
- `arr[i - 1]` is set to be equal to `arr[i]`.

The loop will execute again if `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. Since we need the loop to execute one more time, we must ensure that `arr[i]` remains equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

No other states outside of what is directly involved in the loop condition need to be adjusted. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i]`.

State: **`i` is a valid index such that `i + 1` is also a valid index, `arr[i - 1]` is set to be equal to `arr[i]`, and `arr[i + 1]` must be equal to `arr[i]`**
