The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables, `arr` and `j`, remain unchanged. The precondition that `i` must be less than or equal to `j` is still valid after the code has been executed. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is an array, `i` is increased by 1, `j` remains the same, and `i` is still less than or equal to `j`.

Output State: **`arr` is an array, `i` is increased by 1, `j` remains the same, and `i` is still less than or equal to `j`.**
