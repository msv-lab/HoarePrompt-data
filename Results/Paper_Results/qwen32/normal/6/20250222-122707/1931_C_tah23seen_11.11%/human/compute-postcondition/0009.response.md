To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition, which is `i <= j`. This means that for the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than or equal to `j` at the start of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is an array.
- `i` and `j` are indices.
- If `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[j]` initially, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is decremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`, and all other conditions regarding the state remain as described in the precondition.

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. If `arr[i] == arr[j]` initially, `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is decremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, we need `i + 1 <= j - 1`, which simplifies to `i <= j - 2`.
2. If `arr[i] != arr[j]` initially, the values of `i` and `j` remain the same. For the loop to execute again, we need `i <= j`.

Since we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we should consider the worst-case scenario where `arr[i] != arr[j]` initially, because in this case, no change is made to `i` and `j`, and we simply need `i <= j` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed if `i <= j` already holds true. If we need to ensure that the loop can definitely execute one more time, we can adjust `i` and `j` such that `i <= j`.

State: **`arr` is an array, `i` and `j` are indices, and `i` must be less than or equal to `j`**
