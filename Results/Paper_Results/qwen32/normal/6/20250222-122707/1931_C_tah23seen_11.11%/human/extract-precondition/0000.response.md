Precondition: **arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) is followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
