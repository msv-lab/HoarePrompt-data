The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `arr[i - 1]` was set to be equal to `arr[i]`, and `arr[i + 1]` was equal to `arr[i]`. After incrementing `i`, the new `i` will still satisfy the condition that `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` must be equal to `arr[i]` because the initial state guaranteed these conditions for the previous `i`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]`, and `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i]`.**
