Postcondition: **`arr` is an array, and `i` and `j` are indices. If `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[j]` initially, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`, and all other conditions regarding the state remain as described in the precondition.**
