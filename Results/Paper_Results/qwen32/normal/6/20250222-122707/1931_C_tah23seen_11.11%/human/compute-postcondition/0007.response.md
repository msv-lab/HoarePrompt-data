The `break` statement will terminate the innermost loop it is contained within. However, since there is no loop shown in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement will not have any effect on the variables `arr`, `i`, or `j` in the context provided. The precondition that `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **State is such that `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`. All other conditions regarding the state remain as described in the precondition.**
