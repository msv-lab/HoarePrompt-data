### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to make all elements of an array equal using at most one operation, where the operation consists of selecting a subarray and assigning a new value to all its elements. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray. The goal is to find the minimum cost required to make all elements equal.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and processes each one by calling the `func_1(arr)` function. Let's break down `func_1(arr)`:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (start of the array).
   - `j` is initialized to `len(arr) - 1` (end of the array).

2. **Symmetric Check**:
   - The program enters a while loop to check if the elements at positions `i` and `j` are equal.
   - If they are equal, it moves `i` to the right and `j` to the left.
   - If they are not equal, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Fully Symmetric Case**:
   - If `i` becomes greater than `j`, it means the entire array is symmetric (all elements are the same), and the function returns `0` as no operation is needed.

4. **Finding the Range to Change**:
   - If the array is not fully symmetric, the function finds the first position `i` where the elements are not the same as the next element.
   - It then checks if `j` is not at the end of the array. If not, it returns the cost to change the range from `i` to `j`, which is `j - i + 1`.
   - If `j` is at the end of the array, it returns `j - i`, which is equivalent to `j - i + 1 - 1`. This case seems incorrect as it should handle the last element properly.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Handling Non-Symmetric Arrays**: The program fails to correctly handle cases where the array can be made symmetric with a single operation that does not necessarily start from the beginning or end of the array.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle arrays that require changing a subarray in the middle of the array.
- **Logic Flaws**: The logic for finding the range to change is flawed. It does not consider the possibility of changing a range that starts from the beginning or ends at the end of the array properly.

#### Annotated Code:
The annotations provided describe the state of the program at key points, but they do not address the fundamental issues with the logic of the program. Specifically, they do not highlight the incorrect handling of non-symmetric arrays or the flawed logic for determining the range to change.

#### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. It fails to consider all possible ways to make the array symmetric with a single operation and does not handle edge cases properly.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
