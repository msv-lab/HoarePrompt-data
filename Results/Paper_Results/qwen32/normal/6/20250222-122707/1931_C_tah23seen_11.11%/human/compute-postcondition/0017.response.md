Output State: **`arr` is an array, `i` and `j` are indices such that `i` is less than or equal to `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `arr`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only impact is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
