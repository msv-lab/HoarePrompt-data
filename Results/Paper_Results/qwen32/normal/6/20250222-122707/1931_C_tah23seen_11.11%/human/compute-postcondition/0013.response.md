Postcondition: **`arr` is an array, `i` and `j` are indices. If `arr[i] == arr[j]`, then `i` is increased by 1, `j` is decreased by 1, and `i` remains less than or equal to `j`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `i` and `j` remain indices with `i` less than or equal to `j`.**
