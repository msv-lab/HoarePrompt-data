Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the first integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) is followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`) representing the elements of the array. `i` is 0. `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while i <= j:
    if arr[i] == arr[j]:
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is an array, and `i` and `j` are indices. If `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[j]` initially, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]`, and all other conditions regarding the state remain as described in the precondition.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `arr` is an array, `i` and `j` are indices. If `arr[i] == arr[j]`, then `i` is increased by 1, `j` is decreased by 1, and `i` remains less than or equal to `j`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `i` and `j` remain indices with `i` less than or equal to `j`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `arr` is an array, `i` and `j` are indices such that `i` is less than or equal to `j`. If `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[j]`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
