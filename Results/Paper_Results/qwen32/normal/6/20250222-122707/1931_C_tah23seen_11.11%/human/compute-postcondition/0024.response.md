The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i + 1` was initially a valid index and `arr[i]` was set to be equal to `arr[i + 1]`, after the increment, `i` becomes `i + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `i` is still a valid index, and `arr[i]` remains equal to `arr[i + 1]` as per the initial condition.

Output State: **`i` is a valid index such that `i + 1` is also a valid index, and `arr[i]` is set to be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.**
