The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `arr[i]` remain unchanged. The condition that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]` is no longer guaranteed because `j` has changed.

Output State: **`arr` is an array, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is decremented by 1. The current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the previous value of `arr[j]`.**
