Output State: **`arr` is an array, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is decreased by 1, and `i` is still less than or equal to `j`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged as per the given initial state, and the condition that `i` is still less than or equal to `j` is preserved.
