Output State: **`arr` is an array, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is unchanged. The current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the current value of `arr[j]`.**

Natural language: The value of `i` has been increased by 1, while `j` remains unchanged. The condition that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]` still holds, but `i` now points to the next element in the array.
