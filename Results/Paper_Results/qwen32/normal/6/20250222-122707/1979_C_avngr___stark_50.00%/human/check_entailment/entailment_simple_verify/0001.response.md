### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program and the original assessment step-by-step to determine the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Analysis

The goal is to distribute bets \( x_i \) such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \forall i \]

This condition simplifies to:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \min(k_i \cdot x_i) \]

#### Program Analysis

Here is a detailed breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read.
   - For each test case, the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_i \) are read.

2. **Calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - The program calculates the product of all \( k_i \) values, which is stored in the variable `m`. This is not the LCM but the product of all multipliers.

3. **Generating Initial Bets:**
   - The program generates initial bets \( c_i \) by dividing the product `m` by each multiplier \( k_i \). This is stored in the list `c`. Each \( c_i \) is essentially the product of all other multipliers.

4. **Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
   - The program calculates the GCD of all elements in the list `c` using the `func_1` function. This GCD is stored in the variable `hcf`.

5. **Normalizing Bets:**
   - The program normalizes the bets by dividing each element in `c` by the GCD `hcf`.

6. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than the product divided by the GCD. If the sum is not less, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
   - If the sum is less, it prints the normalized bets.

#### Correctness Analysis

The key issue with the program is the feasibility check. The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` does not correctly ensure that the total bets are strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. Here's why:

- **Product vs. LCM:** The program uses the product of all \( k_i \) values instead of the LCM. While the product can be used, it does not inherently ensure the minimum required condition for all outcomes.
- **Feasibility Check:** The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` does not guarantee that the total bets are strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. The correct condition should ensure that the sum of the bets is less than the minimum of \( k_i \cdot c_i \).

#### Correct Approach

To ensure the correct distribution of bets, the program should:

1. Calculate the product of all \( k_i \) values.
2. Generate initial bets \( c_i \) by dividing the product by each \( k_i \).
3. Normalize the bets by dividing each element by the GCD of the initial bets.
4. Check if the sum of the normalized bets is less than the minimum of \( k_i \cdot c_i \).

However, the current implementation does not correctly perform this check. The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is not sufficient to ensure the required condition.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the feasibility of the bets. The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is not sufficient to ensure that the total bets are strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
