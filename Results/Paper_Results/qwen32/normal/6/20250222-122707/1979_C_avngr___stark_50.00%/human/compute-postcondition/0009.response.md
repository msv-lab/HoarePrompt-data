Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list. The first element `t` of the list is the number of test cases. Each subsequent element is a pair consisting of an integer `n` (number of outcomes) and a list of `n` integers `k_i` (multipliers for each outcome). The function returns `hcf`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `t` and all the multipliers `k_i` from all test cases.**
