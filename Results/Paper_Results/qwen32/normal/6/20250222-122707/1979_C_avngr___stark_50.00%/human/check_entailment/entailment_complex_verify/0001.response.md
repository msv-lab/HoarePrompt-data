### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the original assessment and the annotated code to evaluate the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
The problem requires us to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Given the multipliers \( k_i \) for each outcome, we need to find bets \( x_i \) such that:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \forall i \]

This can be rewritten as:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \min(k_i \cdot x_i) \]

#### Program Analysis Recap:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read.
   - For each test case, the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_i \) are read.

2. **Calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - The program calculates the LCM of all \( k_i \) values. This is done by multiplying all \( k_i \) values together, which is stored in the variable `m`.

3. **Generating Initial Bets:**
   - The program generates initial bets \( c_i \) by dividing the LCM `m` by each multiplier \( k_i \). This is stored in the list `c`.

4. **Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
   - The program calculates the GCD of all elements in the list `c` using the `func_1` function. This GCD is stored in the variable `hcf`.

5. **Normalizing Bets:**
   - The program normalizes the bets by dividing each element in `c` by the GCD `hcf`.

6. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than the LCM divided by the GCD. If the sum is not less, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
   - If the sum is less, it prints the normalized bets.

#### Correctness Analysis:
The program's logic has a fundamental flaw in the feasibility check. The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` does not correctly ensure that the total bets are strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. Here's why:

- **LCM Calculation:** The LCM of the multipliers is indeed used to ensure that the bets can be distributed in a way that satisfies the condition for all outcomes.
- **Initial Bets:** By dividing the LCM by each multiplier, the program ensures that the bets are proportional to the required condition.
- **Normalization:** Dividing by the GCD helps in reducing the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the condition.

However, the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is not sufficient. The correct condition should ensure that the total bets are strictly less than the smallest possible return, which is the minimum of \( k_i \cdot c_i \). The current implementation does not correctly ensure this.

Let's consider a specific example from the problem statement:

**Example:**
```
Input:
3
3
3 2 7
2
3 3
5
5 5 5 5 5
```

**Output:**
```
27 41 12
1 1
-1
```

For the first test case:
- \( k = [3, 2, 7] \)
- LCM \( m = 3 \times 2 \times 7 = 42 \)
- Initial bets \( c = [42/3, 42/2, 42/7] = [14, 21, 6] \)
- GCD of \( c \) is 3
- Normalized bets \( c = [14/3, 21/3, 6/3] = [4.67, 7, 2] \) (rounded to integers: [5, 7, 2])
- Sum of normalized bets \( = 5 + 7 + 2 = 14 \)
- \( m / hcf = 42 / 3 = 14 \)

The condition `sum(c) >= m / hcf` is incorrect because it should be checking if the sum of the bets is strictly less than the smallest possible return, which is the minimum of \( k_i \cdot c_i \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the feasibility of the bets. The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is not sufficient to ensure that the total bets are strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

**Final: False**
