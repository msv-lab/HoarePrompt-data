The given code snippet increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is `n + 1`. Therefore, the value at `a[n + 1] - 1` in the list `r` will be incremented by 1.

Since `i` is `n + 1`, the value `a[n + 1]` is accessed, and `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is incremented by 1. This affects the list `r` specifically at the index `a[n + 1] - 1`.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` represents how many times `j + 1` appears in the list `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where the element at index `a[n + 1] - 1` is incremented by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 1`.**
