Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50,000, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= floor(n/2). a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 50,000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            l[a[i] - 1] = 0
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                r[a[i] - 1] = 0
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All elements in `res` will have been printed. `i` will be the last element in `res`. `re` will be the count of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1. `res` will be empty or fully processed. `k` will be updated to `2 * k - ul`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ur` is incremented by 2 for each element in `res` where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is empty, and `i` is `2 * n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking. If the loop breaks, `ul` and `ur` are equal. During the loop, `ur` is incremented by 2 for each occurrence of `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0 for each `i` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements of `res` have been printed, and `i` is the last element of `res`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `i` is `2 * n - 1`, and `ur` is incremented by 2 for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2. `re`, `ul`, `r`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to any variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
