To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is set to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.
2. **Variable `a`**: The variable `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since we are accessing `a[i]`, we can infer that `a` must be a list or an array that has at least 3 elements (because `i` is 2, and list indices start from 0).

### Key Points:
- Since `a` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact values of `a[2]` or `a[2]`.
- We know `a[i]` is `a[2]` because `i` is 2.
- The print statement will output `a[2]` twice, separated by a space, and no newline at the end because `end=' '`.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be the value of `a[2]` printed twice, separated by a space. Since the exact value of `a[2]` is not provided, we describe it using the given information.

Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**
