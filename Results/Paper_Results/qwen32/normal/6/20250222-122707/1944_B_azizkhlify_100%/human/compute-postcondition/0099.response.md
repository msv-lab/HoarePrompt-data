The code snippet `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` modifies the list `r` by setting the element at index `a[i] - 1` to 0. Given the initial state, `i` is `n + 2`, and `n` must be greater than 2.

The value at `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is set to 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 2, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**
