The code snippet `ul += 2` increments the variable `ul` by 2. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0. These conditions are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0, `ul` is increased by 2**.
