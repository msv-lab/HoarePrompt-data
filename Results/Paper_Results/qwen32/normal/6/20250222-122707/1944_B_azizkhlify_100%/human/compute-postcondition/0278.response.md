To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to focus on the value of `a[i]` given the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 (though this does not directly affect the value of `a[i]`).
- `l[a[i] - 1]` can either equal 1 or not equal 1 (this condition does not directly affect the value of `a[i]` either).
- `re` and `res` are mentioned but do not affect the `print` statement directly as per the given information.

### Key Information:
- The `print` statement is `print(a[i], end=' ')`.
- `i` is 2, so we need to know the value of `a[2]`.

### Analysis:
Since the initial state does not provide the explicit values of the list `a`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[2]`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the element at index 2 of the list `a`, followed by a space. The exact value of `a[2]` is not provided, but we can describe the output in terms of `a[2]`.

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the element at index 2 of the list `a`)**
