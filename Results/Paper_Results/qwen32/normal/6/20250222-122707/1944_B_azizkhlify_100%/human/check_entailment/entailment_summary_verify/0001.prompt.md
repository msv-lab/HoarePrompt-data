You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
For each test case, the function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It prints integers from the list according to specific rules related to the count `k`. The function ensures that each integer from 1 to n is printed exactly twice across all outputs for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the Array into Two Halves:**
   - It initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of size `n` to count the occurrences of each number in the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes counters `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and a list `res` to help in constructing the `l` and `r` subsets.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It counts the occurrences of each number in the first half of `a` and stores these counts in `l`.
   - Similarly, it counts the occurrences of each number in the second half of `a` and stores these counts in `r`.

4. **Constructing Subset `l`:**
   - It starts by adding pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice in the first half of `a` to `l`.
   - If the number of elements added to `l` reaches `2k`, it breaks out of the loop.
   - If not, it then adds single occurrences of numbers in the first half of `a` to `l` until the total number of elements added reaches `2k`.

5. **Constructing Subset `r`:**
   - It prints the numbers added to `l` in the previous steps.
   - It then prints the numbers added to `l` again to form `r`.

6. **Ensuring `ul == ur`:**
   - If the number of elements added to `l` is not equal to the number of elements added to `r`, it attempts to balance it by adding pairs of numbers from the second half of `a` to `r`.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Balancing `ul` and `ur`:** The program attempts to balance `ul` and `ur` by adding pairs of numbers from the second half of `a` to `r`, but this approach might not always work. The program does not ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal.
- **Constructing `r`:** The program prints the same elements for both `l` and `r`, which might not always satisfy the XOR condition unless the numbers added to `l` and `r` are chosen such that their XOR is equal.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not guarantee that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` will be equal. It simply adds elements to `l` and `r` based on their occurrences without ensuring the XOR condition. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
