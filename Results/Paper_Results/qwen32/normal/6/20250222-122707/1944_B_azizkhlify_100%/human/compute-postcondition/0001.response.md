The code reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the new values for `n` and `k`, and the unchanged value for `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.**
