The given code snippet increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` by 1. Based on the initial state, `l` is a list of `n` zeros except for the indices specified by `a[i] - 1`, which have been incremented by either 1 or 2 previously.

Given the operation `l[a[i] - 1] += 1`, the value at `l[a[i] - 1]` will increase by 1. Therefore, if `l[a[i] - 1]` was previously 0, it will become 1. If it was 1, it will become 2. If it was 2, it will become 3, and so on.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is incremented by 1 (from its previous value); `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is `i + 1`.**
