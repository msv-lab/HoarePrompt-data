To determine the output, let's break down the given information step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is the last element of `res`. This means `i` is an index.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer. (This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so it doesn't affect the output directly.)
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2. This tells us something about the value of `a[i]` and the list `r`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`. This means it will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and will not add a newline at the end.

3. **Determine the value of `a[i]`:**
   - From the condition `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, we can infer that `a[i]` must be an integer such that when we subtract 1 from it, we get an index that points to the value 2 in the list `r`.
   - Let's denote `a[i]` as `x`. Therefore, `r[x - 1] = 2`.
   - Without knowing the exact contents of `r`, we can't determine the exact value of `x`, but we know that `x` is an integer such that `r[x - 1] = 2`.

Since the exact value of `x` (or `a[i]`) is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the condition given.

**Output:**
The print statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, where `a[i]` is an integer such that `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is an integer such that r[a[i] - 1] equals 2)**
