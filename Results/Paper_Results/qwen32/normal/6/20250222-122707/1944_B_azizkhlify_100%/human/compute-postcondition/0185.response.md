To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `i` is the next element in `res`.
- `res` must contain at least `n+1` elements.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is described as "the next element in `res`." This implies that `i` is the value of the element at the position that comes immediately after the current position in `res`. However, the exact position of the "next element" in `res` is not specified, but it is guaranteed that `res` has at least `n+1` elements.
- The `print` statement uses `end=' '`, which means that after printing the value of `i`, a space will be printed instead of the default newline character.

### Output:
Since we do not have the exact value of `i` or the specific elements of `res`, we can only describe the output in terms of the variable `i`.

Output: **i (where i is the next element in the list `res`)**
