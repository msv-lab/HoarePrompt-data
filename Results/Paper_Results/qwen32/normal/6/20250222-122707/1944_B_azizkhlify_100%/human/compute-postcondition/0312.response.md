To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`i` is the last element of `res` plus 2**:
   - This implies that `i` is calculated based on the last element of the list `res`. If the last element of `res` is `x`, then `i = x + 2`.
   
2. **`n` is a non-negative integer**:
   - The variable `n` is mentioned but not directly used in the print statement. It's provided as part of the initial state, so we should be aware of it, but it doesn't affect the print statement directly.

### Print Statement Analysis:
- The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.
- This means it will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Determining the Output:
- The value of `a[i]` depends on the list `a` and the value of `i`.
- Since `i` is calculated as the last element of `res` plus 2, the exact value of `a[i]` cannot be determined without knowing the contents of `res` and `a`.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, where `i` is the last element of the list `res` plus 2.

Output: **a[i], a[i] (where i = last element of res + 2)**
