The code snippet `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1. Given that `i` is `n + 2`, the value at `a[n + 2] - 1` in the list `r` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, but the value at the specific index in `r` is updated.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n + 2`, the value at `r[a[n + 2] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
