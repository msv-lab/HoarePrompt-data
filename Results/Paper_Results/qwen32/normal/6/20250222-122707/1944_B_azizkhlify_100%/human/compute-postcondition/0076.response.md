To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state:

1. **`ul`**: This variable is defined as the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, multiplied by 2. However, the exact value of `ul` is not directly relevant to the `print(i, end=' ')` statement since `i` is not dependent on `ul`.

2. **`res`**: This is a list that contains at least one element. The exact elements of the list are not provided, but we know that `i` is the next element in this list.

3. **`i`**: This variable is explicitly stated to be the next element in the `res` list. Since `res` contains at least one element, `i` will be the first element of `res`.

4. **`re`**: This variable is the count of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1. Similar to `ul`, the exact value of `re` is not directly relevant to the `print(i, end=' ')` statement.

5. **`k`**: This variable is updated to `2 * k - ul`. Again, the exact value of `k` is not directly relevant to the `print(i, end=' ')` statement.

Given the information, the `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i`, which is the first element of the `res` list, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` argument).

Since the exact value of `i` (the first element of `res`) is not provided, we can only describe it as the first element of `res`.

Output: **i (where i is the first element of the res list)**
