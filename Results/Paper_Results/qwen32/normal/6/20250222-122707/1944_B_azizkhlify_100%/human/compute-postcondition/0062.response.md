Postcondition: **`ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, multiplied by 2; `k` is a non-zero value; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 1. If `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `re` and `res` remain unchanged based on the condition that if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, `re` is increased by 1 and `res` contains `a[1]`.**
