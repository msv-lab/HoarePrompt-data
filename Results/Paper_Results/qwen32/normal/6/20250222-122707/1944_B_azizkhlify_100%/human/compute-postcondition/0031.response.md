To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
2. `i` is incremented by 1. This means `i` will be 1 if it was initially 0, 2 if it was initially 1, and so on.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet prints two elements from the list `a` at index `i`, followed by a space.
- The value of `i` is determined by the precondition, which states that `i` is incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `i` is not specified. So, we can only assume that `i` is some integer value after it has been incremented by 1.
- The list `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we don't know the exact values of `a[i]`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `a[i]`.

### Output Description:
- The code will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i of the list a)**
