The code snippet modifies the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by setting it to 0. Given the initial state, we know that `r[a[i] - 1]` was initially 2. After the code execution, `r[a[i] - 1]` is updated to 0. No other variables are mentioned as being changed, so they retain their initial states.

Output State: **`res` is empty, `n` must be a non-negative integer, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**
