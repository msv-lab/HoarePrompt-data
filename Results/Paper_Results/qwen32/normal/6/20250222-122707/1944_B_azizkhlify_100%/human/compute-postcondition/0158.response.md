The code snippet `res.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `res`. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 0, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, and `re` is incremented by 1, but `re` is not directly affected by the provided code snippet. The only change is that `a[i]` is added to the list `res`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, `re` is incremented by 1, `res` contains `a[i]` appended to it.**
