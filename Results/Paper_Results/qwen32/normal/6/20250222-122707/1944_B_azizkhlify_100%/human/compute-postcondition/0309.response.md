Output State: **`i` is the last element of `res` plus 1, `n` is a non-negative integer. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `ur` remain as they were in the initial state.
