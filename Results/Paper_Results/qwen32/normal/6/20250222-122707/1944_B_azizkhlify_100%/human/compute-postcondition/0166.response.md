The code snippet appends the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the list `res`. This operation does not change the values of `n` or `i`, and it does not affect the condition `n` is greater than `i + 1`. The only change is that `res` now includes the element `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`; `re` is increased by 1; `res` has an additional element `a[i]` appended to it.**
