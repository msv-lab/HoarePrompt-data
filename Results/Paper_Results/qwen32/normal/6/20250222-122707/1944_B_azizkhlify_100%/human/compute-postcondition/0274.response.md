Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `l[a[i] - 1]` either equals 1 or does not equal 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, `re` is incremented by 1 and `res` contains an additional element `a[i]`. If `re` equals `k` after the increment, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `re` does not equal `k` and the program continues as per the else part, which does not alter the given conditions on `i`, `n`, and `l[a[i] - 1]`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 1, the program continues without altering `re` or `res`.**
