Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, which implies that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is 2.

However, the provided code snippet does not mention the list `l` directly. It only uses the variable `a[i]` twice in the `print` statement. Since the exact values of `a[i]` and the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `a[i]`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and will not add a newline at the end of the output due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a)**
