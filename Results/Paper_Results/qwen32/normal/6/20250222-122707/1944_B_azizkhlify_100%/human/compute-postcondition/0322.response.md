Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing half the length of the list `a`, an integer `k` representing a specific count, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function returns an integer for each test case based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.**
