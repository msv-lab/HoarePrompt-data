Let's break down the problem step by step using the provided initial state and the Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is set to `n`.
2. `n` must be less than `2 * n`. This condition is always true for any positive integer `n` (and for `n = 0`, it is trivially true as well).
3. The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- We know that `i` is set to `n`.
- We need to determine the value of `a[i]`, which is `a[n]` given that `i` is `n`.
- The condition `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2 gives us information about the value of `a[i]` indirectly. Specifically, it tells us that `r[a[n] - 1]` is 2. However, without knowing the exact contents of the list `r` or the value of `a[n]`, we can only infer that `a[n] - 1` must be an index in `r` that corresponds to the value 2.

### Output Determination:
- The print statement prints `a[i]` twice, which is `a[n]` twice.
- Since the exact value of `a[n]` is not provided, we can only describe it based on the given information.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `a[n]` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end.

Output: **a[n], a[n] (where a[n] is the value at index n of the list a)**
