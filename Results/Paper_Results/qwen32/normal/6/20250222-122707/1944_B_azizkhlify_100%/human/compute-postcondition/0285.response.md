Postcondition: **`i` is `n-1` if `k` is `0`; otherwise, `i` is `n`. If `k` is `0`, `re` and `res` remain unchanged. If `k` is not `0`, `re` is the count of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was `1`, `res` contains all `a[i]` values for which `l[a[i] - 1]` was `1`, and `ul`, `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `k` remain unchanged.**
