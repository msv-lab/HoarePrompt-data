Output State: **`res` is empty, `n` is a non-negative integer, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and if `ul` equals `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is increased by 2; otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged. The values of `ul` and `ur` are equal if the loop or if statement was broken out of, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their previous states, including the condition that if `ul` equals `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. The values of `ul` and `ur` being equal still holds if the loop or if statement was broken out of, and `i` is incremented by 1.
