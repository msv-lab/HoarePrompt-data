Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a list of strings representing the digits of the new input integer; `b` is a list of strings representing the digits of the new input integer from the latest input. The state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged regardless of whether `b[n - 2]` equals `<` or not.**
