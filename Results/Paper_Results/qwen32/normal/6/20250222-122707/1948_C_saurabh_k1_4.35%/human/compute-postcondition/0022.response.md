Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `a` is a list of strings representing the digits of the new input integer; `b` is a list of strings representing the digits of the latest input integer. If `b[n - 2]` is equal to the string `'<'`, the condition of the if statement is satisfied. Otherwise, the else part is executed, but the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
