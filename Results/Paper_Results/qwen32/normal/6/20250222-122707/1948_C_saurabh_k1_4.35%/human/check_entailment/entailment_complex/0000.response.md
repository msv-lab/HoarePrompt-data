Reasoning: 
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program only checks if the second-to-last character of the second row is '<'. If it is, the program outputs "No", otherwise it outputs "Yes". However, the problem requires determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the movement rules described, which involve the robot moving according to the arrows in both rows and not just a single character in the second row.

The logic of the program is too simplistic and does not account for the robot's ability to move between rows and follow the arrows in both rows. It does not simulate the robot's path through the grid according to the rules provided.

Correctness: **False**
