The provided code snippet has a for loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the function `input()`. Since the loop head only deals with the iteration count and the input function, we need to ensure that the input function provides valid input for the loop to execute.

Given the description, the state before the loop starts includes:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Since the loop will execute `t` times, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The state of `t` being between 1 and 10^4 already satisfies this condition.

There are no other variables in the loop head that need adjustment. The loop body is omitted, so we do not need to consider any variables or states within the loop body.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already suitable for the loop to execute, and no further adjustments are needed for the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
