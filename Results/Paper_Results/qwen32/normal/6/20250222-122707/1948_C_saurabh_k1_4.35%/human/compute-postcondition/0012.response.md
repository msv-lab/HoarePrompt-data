The code snippet provided assigns a new value to the variable `b`, which is now a list of strings representing the digits of the new input integer. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the previous list `b` is overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is a list of strings representing the digits of the new input integer; `b` is a list of strings representing the digits of the new input integer from the latest input.**
