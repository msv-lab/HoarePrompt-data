The code snippet takes an input integer `n` and converts it into a list of its digits as strings. The variable `a` is assigned this list. The values of `t` and the fact that `n` is an input integer remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the output state should reflect the new value of `a` as a list of strings representing the digits of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of strings representing the digits of `n`.**
