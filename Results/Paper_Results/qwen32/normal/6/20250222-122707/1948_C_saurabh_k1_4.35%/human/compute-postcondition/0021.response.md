The `print('Yes')` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. The string 'Yes' is directly printed to the console.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This variable represents some kind of count or limit, but it is not used in the provided print statement.
2. The variable `n` is the integer input by the user. This variable could be used elsewhere in the program, but it is not referenced in the print statement.
3. The variable `a` is a list of strings representing the digits of the new input integer. This list is also not used in the print statement.
4. The variable `b` is a list of strings representing the digits of the latest input integer. This list is also not used in the print statement.

Since the print statement is `print('Yes')`, it will output the string 'Yes' as is.

Output: **Yes**
