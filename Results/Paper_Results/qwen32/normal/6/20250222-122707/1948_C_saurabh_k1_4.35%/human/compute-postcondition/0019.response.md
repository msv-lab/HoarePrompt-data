The code snippet `b = list(map(str, input()))` takes an input from the user, converts each character of the input string to a string (which is redundant since the characters are already strings), and then stores these characters in the list `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `a` is a list of strings representing the digits of the new input integer; `b` is a list of strings representing the digits of the latest input integer.**
