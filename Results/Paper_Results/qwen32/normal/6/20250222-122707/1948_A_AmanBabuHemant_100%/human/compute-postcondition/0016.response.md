Given the initial state, we have the following information:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50.
- `n` is the integer value provided by the input.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

The statement `print('NO')` is independent of the variables `t` and `n`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
