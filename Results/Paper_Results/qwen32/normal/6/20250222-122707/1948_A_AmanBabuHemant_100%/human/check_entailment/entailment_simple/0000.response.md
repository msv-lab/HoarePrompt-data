### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a string where exactly `n` characters are special. A character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The provided program attempts to solve this problem by generating strings with the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times if `n` is even. The reasoning behind this approach is that in the string "AAB", the character 'A' at the middle position is special (it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors). 

Let's break down the program's logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
2. **Odd `n`**: If `n` is odd, the program correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is part of a pair (like 'A' in "AAB").
3. **Even `n`**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating the pattern "AAB" `n // 2` times. This ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters (each 'A' in "AAB" is special). The program then checks if the length of the generated string is less than 200. Since `n` is at most 50, repeating "AAB" `n // 2` times results in a string of length at most 150, which is well within the limit. Therefore, the program correctly prints "YES" followed by the generated string.

The given program handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem constraints. It correctly identifies when a solution is impossible (when `n` is odd) and provides a valid solution when `n` is even.
