The code snippet `s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)` creates a new string `s` by repeating the substring `'AAB'` for `n // 2` times. Since `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer.

Given that `n` is an even integer, the length of the string `s` will be `3 * (n // 2)`, as each `'AAB'` contributes 3 characters.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, `n` is the integer value provided by the input, and `n` is even; `s` is the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.**
