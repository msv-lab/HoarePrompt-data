The initial state describes the following:
- `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50.
- `n` is an integer value provided by the input.
- `s` is a string that consists of the substring `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.

However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'` and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not require any calculations or descriptions of the variables `t`, `n`, or `s`.

Output: **YES**
