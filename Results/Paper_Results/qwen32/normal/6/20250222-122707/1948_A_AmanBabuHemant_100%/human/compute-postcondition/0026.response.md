The code snippet creates a string `s` by repeating the substring `'AAB'` a number of times equal to `n // 2`. Given that `n` is an input integer, the value of `s` will be a string consisting of the pattern `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 50, `n` is the newly input integer, `s` is the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.**
