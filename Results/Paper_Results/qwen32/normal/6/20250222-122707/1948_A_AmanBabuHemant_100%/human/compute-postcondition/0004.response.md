The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'NO', regardless of the values of `t` and `n`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t` and `n`, but these do not affect the output of the `print` statement in this case.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50.
- `n` is an integer value provided by the input and is specified to be odd.

Since the `print` statement is `print('NO')`, it will output the string 'NO' directly.

Output: **NO**
