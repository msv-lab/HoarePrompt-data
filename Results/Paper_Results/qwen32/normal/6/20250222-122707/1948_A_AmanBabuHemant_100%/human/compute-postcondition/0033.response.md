The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The function does not explicitly accept these parameters in the function signature provided, but based on the context, it is implied that these values are used within the function.

The function returns different values based on the value of `n` for each test case:
- Case_1: If `n` is 1, the function returns 0.
- Case_2: If `n` is greater than 1, the function returns 2 * (n - 1).

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and for each test case, an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. For each test case, if `n` is 1, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns 2 * (n - 1).**
