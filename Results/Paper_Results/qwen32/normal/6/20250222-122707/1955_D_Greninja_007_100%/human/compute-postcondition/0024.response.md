Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]` with `ca[a[r]]` incremented by 1, `ca[a[r - m]]` decremented by 1. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, then `sm` is decremented by 1. If `ca[a[r]]` is less than `cb[a[r]]`, `sm` is incremented by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, `r` is set to m + 1.**

In simpler terms: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within specified bounds, `a` and `b` are lists of integers with constraints, `cb` and `ca` are `Counter` objects for `b` and the current window of `a` respectively. After updating the counters, if the frequency of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is less than or equal to its frequency in `cb`, `sm` is decremented. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 2; otherwise, `ans` remains 0. The index `r` is then set to `m + 1`.**
