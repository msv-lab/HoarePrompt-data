Let's break down the provided initial state and the Python code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`sng`**: This is a list that contains at least one element.
2. **`elem`**: This variable is assigned the next element in the list `sng`. The exact value of `elem` depends on the current position in the list `sng`.
3. **`sz`**: This variable is incremented by 1. The exact value of `sz` is not specified, but it is relevant in the condition `if sz >= k`.
4. **`rdb`**: This variable is either empty or contains the remaining elements. The exact state of `rdb` and its impact on the code is not clear from the description, but it's mentioned in the context of processing elements.
5. **`k`**: This is a threshold value that, when `sz` reaches or exceeds it, breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The exact value of `k` is not provided.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Explanation:
- **`elem`**: This variable holds the value of the next element in the list `sng`. Since the exact position in the list `sng` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem`. However, based on the precondition, `elem` is guaranteed to be a valid element from the list `sng`.
- **`end=' '`**: This argument in the `print` function specifies that the output should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

### Output:
Given the information, the `print` statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space. Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we describe it as the next element in the list `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in the list `sng`) followed by a space**
