The code snippet appends the element at index 2 of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Since `i` is 2, `lft[i]` refers to the element at index 2 of `lft`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `i` is 2, and `ldb` has an additional element which is `lft[2]`.**

In simpler terms, `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, and `i` remain unchanged, but `ldb` now includes an additional element, which is the element at index 2 of `lft`.
