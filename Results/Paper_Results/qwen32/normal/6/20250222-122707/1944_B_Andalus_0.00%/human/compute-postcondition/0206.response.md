To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

Given:
- `sz` is 0.
- `sng` is a list where the first `k` elements have been printed.
- `rdb` is a list that must have at least 1 element.
- `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, meaning `k` is at least 2.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

However, the variable `elem` is not defined in the initial state. Since it is not provided, we need to infer its value based on the context. Typically, in such scenarios, `elem` might be an element from a list that is being iterated over or processed. Given that `sng` and `rdb` are lists, `elem` could potentially be an element from either of these lists.

Since `sng` has the first `k` elements printed, and `k` is at least 2, it implies `sng` has at least two elements. If `elem` is being printed in a loop or function, it could be the next element to be processed in `sng` or `rdb`.

Without loss of generality, let's assume `elem` is an element from `sng` (since `sng` is mentioned first and has elements that have been printed). Given that `k` is at least 2 and `sz` is 0, `elem` could be `sng[0]` or `sng[1]` (or any element in `sng` that hasn't been explicitly mentioned to be printed beyond the first `k` elements).

Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from the list `sng` or `rdb`)**
