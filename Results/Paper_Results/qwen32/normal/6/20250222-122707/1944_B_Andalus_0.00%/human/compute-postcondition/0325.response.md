To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the provided initial state and the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `sz` is 0.
- `rdb` must contain at least one element.
- The current value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is attempting to print the variable `elem` twice, separated by a space, and it specifies that the end of the print statement should be a space (`end=' '`).
- The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine its exact value based on the given information.
- Since `elem` is not defined, we can only describe the output in terms of `elem`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and the line will not end with a newline character but with a space.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the value of the variable `elem`)**
