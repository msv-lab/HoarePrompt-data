Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then prints `k` integers from the list, ensuring that the printed integers are chosen such that if an integer appears twice in the list, it is printed twice if possible, and otherwise, it is printed once. The function ensures that exactly `k` integers are printed for each test case.**
