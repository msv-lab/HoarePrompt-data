Output State: **`sz` is 0, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` and `k` are set to the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates and must have at least 1 element; `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates consecutively; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates; `i` is `n-1`; `elem` is the next element in `ldb` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain unchanged from the initial state, except that the loop or if statement is exited due to the `break` statement.
