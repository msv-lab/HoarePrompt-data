Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`, or the total number of elements in `ldb` multiplied by 2, whichever is smaller. All other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sz` is an integer incremented by 1 and `k` is an integer. If `sz` (original value) is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `sz` or `k` except that `sz` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sz` is an integer incremented by 2 and still less than `k`, `k` is an integer, and `elem` is the next element in `sng`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `sz` was not less than `k`. Otherwise, the loop or statement continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sz` is an integer incremented by 3 and still less than `k`, `k` is an integer, and `elem` is the subsequent element in `sng`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
