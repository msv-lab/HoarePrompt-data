The code snippet `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Given the initial state, `i` is `k + 2`, and `ldb` either contains `lft[i]` or is an empty list depending on previous conditions.

The only change here is that `ldb` now includes the element `lft[k + 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is set to the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains `lft[k + 2]`; `sng` contains the first `k` elements of `lft`; `i` is `k + 2`**.
