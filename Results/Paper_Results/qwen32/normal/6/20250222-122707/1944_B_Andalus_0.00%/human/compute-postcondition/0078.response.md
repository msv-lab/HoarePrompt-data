The code snippet provided increments the variable `sz` by 1. Given the initial state, we need to reflect this change in the output state.

Initial State: 
- `T` is an integer greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice
- `lst` is a list of integers from the input
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst`
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end
- `ldb` is an empty list (or contains elements that were not processed because `sz` reached `k`)
- `sng` contains at least two elements that are in `lft` and are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs
- `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively
- `i` is `n`
- `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus two. If `sz` is equal to `k + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.
- `elem` is the second element of `sng`

The code snippet `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. No other variables are affected.
