To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `sz` is an integer.
2. `sng` is a list where the first `k` elements have been printed.
3. `rdb` is a list with at least 1 element.
4. The value of `sz` is updated based on the condition: if `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is updated to `sz + 2`; otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.
5. If `sz >= k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement is printing the variable `elem` twice, separated by a space, and the `end` parameter is set to a space, meaning the next print statement will continue on the same line.

However, the variable `elem` is not defined in the provided initial state. Since we don't have a specific value for `elem`, we need to infer its context based on the provided information.

Given that the initial state mentions `sng` is a list where the first `k` elements have been printed, it is reasonable to assume that `elem` might be an element from the list `sng` or `rdb`. However, without a specific reference to which list `elem` belongs, or any loop that might be iterating over these lists, we cannot definitively determine the exact value of `elem`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided and we are only given that it is printed twice, we will describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from the list being processed)**
