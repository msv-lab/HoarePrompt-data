Postcondition: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst` with at least one pair of consecutive identical elements, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index n to the end, `ldb` contains all elements that appear twice consecutively in `lft` and has at least one more element to be processed, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively, `i` is `n`. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz >= k`, then `sz` remains unchanged and the loop or statement is broken. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.**
