To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and see how the variables `elem`, `lft`, and `rgt` are defined and manipulated.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`T`**: An integer greater than 0 (not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than 1 (defines the number of pairs in `a`).
3. **`k`**: The second integer from the input (not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
4. **`a`**: A list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice (not directly relevant to the `print` statement).
5. **`lst`**: A list of integers from the input (used to form `lft` and `rgt`).
6. **`lft`**: A sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` with at least one pair of consecutive identical elements.
7. **`rgt`**: A sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
8. **`ldb`**: Contains all elements that appear twice consecutively in `lft` and has at least one more element to be processed.
9. **`sng`**: Contains all elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs.
10. **`rdb`**: Contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively.
11. **`i`**: Initialized to `n` (not directly relevant to the `print` statement unless it influences the loop or other logic).
12. **`sz`**: A variable that, if `sz >= k`, breaks the loop or statement (not directly relevant to the `print` statement).

### Key Variable for the Print Statement:
- **`elem`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so its value must be determined from the context of the loop or code snippet where this `print` statement is placed.

### Analysis Based on Context:
The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement suggests that `elem` is being printed twice with a space in between. Since `elem` is not defined in the initial state, it must be defined within a loop or a specific block of code that we are not seeing here. However, given the context of the problem, `elem` is likely an element from `lft` or `rgt` that is part of a consecutive pair or being processed in some way.

### Conclusion:
Without the exact loop or block of code where `elem` is defined, we can only infer that `elem` is an element from `lft` or `rgt` that is part of a consecutive pair or being processed. Since `lft` contains at least one pair of consecutive identical elements, `elem` is likely one of those elements.

### Output:
Given the information, the most precise description of what is printed is:

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from `lft` or `rgt` that is part of a consecutive pair or being processed)**
