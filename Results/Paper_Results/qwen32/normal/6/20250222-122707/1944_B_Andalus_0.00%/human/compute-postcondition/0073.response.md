Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list (or contains elements that were not processed because `sz` reached `k`), `sng` contains at least two elements that are in `lft` and are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus two. If `sz` is equal to `k + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In natural language: The value of `sz` has been incremented by 1, making it the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus two. All other variables remain unchanged.
