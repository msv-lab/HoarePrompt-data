Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` and `k` are set to the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates; `rdb` is an empty list; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is set to the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates; `rdb` is a list containing the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is set to the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates; `rdb` is a list containing the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` and now also includes `rgt[i]` if the condition `rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]` is true; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates`; `i` is `k + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` must be greater than `k + 2`; `k` is set to the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates; `rdb` is a list containing the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` and now also includes `rgt[k + 2]` if the condition `rgt[k + 2] == rgt[k + 1]` is true; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates`; `i` is `k + 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
