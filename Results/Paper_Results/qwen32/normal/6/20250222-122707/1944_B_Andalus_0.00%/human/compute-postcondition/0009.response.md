The code sorts the list `lft`. This means that the order of elements in `lft` will be changed to be in ascending order. The other lists and variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `lst`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.**
