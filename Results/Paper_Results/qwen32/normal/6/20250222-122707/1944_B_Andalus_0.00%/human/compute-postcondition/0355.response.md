Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `sz` is incremented by 1: This means that `sz` has been increased by 1 from its previous value.
2. `rdb` remains unchanged: The value of `rdb` is not modified.
3. `sng` remains unchanged: The list or sequence `sng` is not modified.
4. `elem` is the next element in `sng`: This indicates that `elem` is assigned the next element from the sequence `sng`.
5. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of: This is a condition that might terminate a loop or if statement, but it doesn't affect the current print statement directly.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```
This will print the value of `elem` followed by a space, without a newline character at the end.

### Determining the Output:
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`. Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can only describe it as the next element in the sequence `sng`.
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that the output should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

### Final Output:
Given the information, the most precise description of what will be printed is the next element in the sequence `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in the sequence `sng`) **
