Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` and `k` are set to the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` is an empty list; `rdb` is an empty list; `sng` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is set to the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains `lft[i]` and `rdb` is an empty list. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is an empty list and `sng` contains the first `k` elements of `lft`. Additionally, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is set to the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains `lft[i]` and `rdb` is an empty list. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is an empty list and `sng` contains the first `k` elements of `lft`. Additionally, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. `i` is `k + 1`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` now includes the element `lft[k + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is set to the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains `lft[i]` and `rdb` is an empty list. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is an empty list and `sng` contains the first `k` elements of `lft`. Additionally, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. `i` is `k + 2`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` now includes the element `lft[k + 2]`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains `lft[i]` and `rdb` is an empty list. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is not less than `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
