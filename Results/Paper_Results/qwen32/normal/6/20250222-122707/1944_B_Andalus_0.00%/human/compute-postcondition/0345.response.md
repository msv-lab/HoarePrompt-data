To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context of the print statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`sz`**: This variable is defined as the largest even number less than or equal to `k`, or exactly `k` if `k` is even.
2. **`rdb`**: This is a list from which elements are printed in pairs until `sz` becomes equal to or greater than `k`.
3. **`sng`**: This list must contain at least one element, but its exact role in the print statement is not specified.
4. **`elem`**: This is the variable that holds the current element to be printed. It is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied to be an element from the `rdb` list.

### Context of the Print Statement:
- The print statement `print(elem, end=' ')` is executed within a loop or conditional block that iterates over elements in `rdb`.
- The loop or block continues until `sz` is equal to or greater than `k`.
- The `end=' '` argument in the print statement means that each element will be printed on the same line, separated by a space.

### Conclusion:
Given the context, the `elem` variable will take on the value of each element in the `rdb` list, one at a time, as the loop iterates. The print statement will output each element of `rdb` until the loop condition (related to `sz` and `k`) is met.

Since the exact contents of `rdb` are not specified, we cannot provide the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of `rdb`.

### Final Output:
Output: **elem elem elem ... (where each elem is an element from the rdb list, printed on the same line separated by spaces)**
