The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which is used to iterate over the elements in the list `sng`. To ensure that the loop can execute, `sng` must contain at least one element. The state of `sz`, `k`, `rdb`, and any other variables mentioned do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself, as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that `sng` contains at least one element.

State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `sz` is equal to `k` if `k` is achievable with the number of pairs in `rdb`, otherwise `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`, `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements, all other variables remain unchanged**.
