Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is 0, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sz` is an integer, `sng` is a list where the first `k` elements have been printed, and `rdb` is a list that must have at least 1 element. If `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sz` is an integer and `sng` is a list where the first `k` elements have been printed. `rdb` is a list that must have at least 1 element. If `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is updated to `sz + 2`. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged. If `sz >= k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sz` is an integer and `sng` is a list where the first `k` elements have been printed. `rdb` is a list with at least 1 element. If `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is updated to `sz + 2` and if `k - (sz + 2)` is still greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is further updated to `sz + 4`. If `sz + 2` or `sz + 4` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `k - sz` was initially less than 2, `sz` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
