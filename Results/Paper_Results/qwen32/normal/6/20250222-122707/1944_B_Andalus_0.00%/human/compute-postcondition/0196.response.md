Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State
1. `sng` is a list containing at least two elements.
2. `sz` is initialized to 2.
3. `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
4. `sz` must be less than `k`.
5. If `sz` is not greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement breaks.

### Code Snippet
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `sng`**: Since `sng` must contain at least two elements, let's assume `sng = [a, b, c, ...]` where `a`, `b`, `c`, etc., are elements of the list.
2. **Variable `sz`**: `sz` is initialized to 2.
3. **Variable `elem`**: `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the first two elements. Since `sz` starts at 2, `elem` would be the element at index 2 in `sng`. Therefore, `elem = sng[2] = c` (assuming `sng = [a, b, c, ...]`).
4. **Condition `sz < k`**: The loop or if statement will continue as long as `sz` is less than `k`. Since `sz` is initialized to 2, the condition will be checked to see if `2 < k`. If this condition is true, the loop or if statement will proceed, and `elem` will be printed. If `2 >= k`, the loop or if statement will break, and `elem` will not be printed.

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can only determine the value of `elem` based on the initial state. The value of `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`.

### Conclusion
The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the third element of the list `sng`, followed by a space, as long as the condition `sz < k` is true.

Output: **c (where c is the third element of the list `sng`)**

If `k` is less than or equal to 2, the condition `sz < k` would be false, and the print statement would not execute. However, based on the provided information and the assumption that the loop or if statement is active, the output will be as described.

Output: **c (where c is the third element of the list `sng`)**
