The `break` statement will terminate the most internal loop or if statement immediately, without changing the values of any variables. The conditions and values of `sz`, `sng`, and `rdb` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.

Output State: **`sz` is an integer and `sng` is a list where the first `k` elements have been printed. `rdb` is a list that must have at least 1 element. If `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is updated to `sz + 2`. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged. If `sz >= k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
