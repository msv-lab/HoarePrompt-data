To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Breakdown of the Initial State:

1. **T**: An integer greater than 0.
2. **n**: An integer greater than 1.
3. **k**: The second integer from the input.
4. **a**: A list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
5. **lst**: A list of integers from the input.
6. **lft**: A sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst`.
7. **rgt**: A sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
8. **ldb**: An empty list (or contains elements that were not processed because `sz` reached `k`).
9. **sng**: Contains at least two elements that are in `lft` and are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs.
10. **rdb**: Contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively.
11. **i**: Set to `n`.
12. **sz**: The largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus two.
13. **elem**: The second element of `sng`.

### Key Points to Note:

- **sng** is described as containing at least two elements that are in `lft` and are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs.
- **elem** is specifically the second element of `sng`.

### Determining the Output:

Given that `sng` contains at least two elements, and `elem` is defined as the second element of `sng`, the output will be the value of this second element.

Since the exact values of `sng` and its elements are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given conditions.

### Final Output:

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the second element of the list `sng`, which is described as containing at least two elements that are in `lft` and are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs.

Output: **elem (where elem is the second element of the list `sng`)**
