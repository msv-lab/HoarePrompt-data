The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. Since `sz` was initially an integer incremented by 1 and still less than `k`, after the increment, `sz` remains less than `k` but is now one more than its previous value. The values of `k` and `elem` remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still valid based on the new value of `sz`.

Output State: **`sz` is an integer incremented by 2 and still less than `k`, `k` is an integer, and `elem` is the next element in `sng`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `sz` was not less than `k`. Otherwise, the loop or statement continues.**
