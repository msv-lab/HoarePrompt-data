The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which iterates over `ldb`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `elem` to reflect the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given that `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates and must have at least one element, the loop will execute for each element in `ldb`. At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` was the last element processed in `ldb`. To execute the loop one more time, `elem` should be set to the next element in `ldb`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact number of elements in `ldb` or their order, we can assume that `elem` is currently the last element of `ldb`. To start the next iteration, `elem` should be set to the first element of `ldb` if this is the first iteration, or the next element in `ldb` if this is not the first iteration.

However, since we are asked to adjust the state for the start of the next iteration and given that we do not have information about the current position of `elem` in `ldb`, we can assume that `elem` is about to take the value of the next element in `ldb`.

State: **`sz` is 0, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` and `k` are set to the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates and must have at least 1 element; `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates consecutively; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates; `i` is `n-1`; `elem` is the next element in `ldb`**.

Since we do not have the specific elements of `ldb`, we cannot specify the exact value of `elem`, but we know it should be the next element in `ldb` for the loop to execute one more time.
