To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided and understand the context in which the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `elem` is the next element in `ldb`.
- If `sz >= k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.
- This means that the value of `elem` will be printed twice, separated by a space, and no newline character will be added at the end (due to `end=' '`).

### Key Points:
- The value of `elem` is not explicitly provided, but it is described as "the next element in `ldb`". This implies that `elem` is a variable that holds the current element being processed from the list `ldb`.
- The condition `sz >= k` does not affect the value of `elem` directly but controls the flow of the loop or if statement. If the condition is met, the loop or if statement is exited, but this does not change the current value of `elem`.

### Output:
- Since `elem` is the next element in `ldb`, it will be printed twice.
- The output format will be `elem elem` (with a space in between), and no newline character will be added at the end.

### Final Output:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the next element in the list `ldb`)**
