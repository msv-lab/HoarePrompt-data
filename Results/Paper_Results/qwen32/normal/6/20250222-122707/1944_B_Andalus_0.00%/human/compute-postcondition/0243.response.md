The code snippet `rgt = lst[n:]` assigns the variable `rgt` the sublist of `lst` starting from the index `n` to the end of `lst`. The initial state specifies that `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input, and `n` is set to a value provided by the input.

Given this, the output state will be:

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` and `k` are set to the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`.**
