Postcondition: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements that appear twice consecutively in `lft`, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` contains the element `rgt[i]`.**
