The code snippet `sng.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `sng`. Given the initial state, `sng` has already printed elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k`, and `i` is `k + 2`. The other conditions related to `ldb` and the specific checks on `lft[i]` do not affect this particular line of code.

After executing `sng.append(lft[i])`, the list `sng` will have the element `lft[i]` added to it. Therefore, the only change is in the list `sng`.

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `i` is `k + 2`, and `sng` now contains the element `lft[i]` appended to it.**
