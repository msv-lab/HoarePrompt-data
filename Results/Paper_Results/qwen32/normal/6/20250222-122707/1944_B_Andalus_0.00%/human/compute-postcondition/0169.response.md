The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which is iterated over from the list `ldb`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `elem` to the next element in `ldb`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sz` is 0, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`
- `rdb` is a list containing elements from `rgt[1]` to `rgt[n-1]` that are equal to their preceding element
- `T` is greater than 0
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end
- `ldb` is a list containing at least one element
- `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position
- `i` is `n-1`
- If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is set to 2

Since we are only concerned with the loop head, we need to adjust `elem` to the next element in `ldb`. If `ldb` contains more than one element, `elem` should be set to the second element (or the next element in the list after the last one processed).

Let's assume that `ldb` has at least two elements for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, `elem` should be set to the next element in `ldb`.

State: **`sz` is 0, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is a list containing elements from `rgt[1]` to `rgt[n-1]` that are equal to their preceding element, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is a list containing at least two elements, `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position, `i` is `n-1`, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`**
