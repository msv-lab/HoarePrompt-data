Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`sz`**: This is defined as the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 1. However, the specific value of `k` is not given, so we can't determine the exact numerical value of `sz`. But we know it is derived from `k`.
2. **`sng`**: This is a list with at least two elements. The specific elements of the list are not provided, but we know it has at least two elements.
3. **`elem`**: This is the second element of the list `sng`. Since `sng` has at least two elements, `elem` is well-defined, though its exact value is not given.
4. **Conditional Statement**: The conditional statement checks if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, this does not affect the `print` statement directly, as the `print` statement is not inside this conditional block.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Output Analysis:
- **`elem`**: As per the initial state, `elem` is the second element of the list `sng`. Since the exact elements of `sng` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `elem`. However, we know it is the second element of the list.
- **`end=' '`**: This parameter in the `print` statement specifies that a space should be printed at the end of the output, instead of the default newline.

### Final Output:
Given the information provided, the `print` statement will output the second element of the list `sng`, followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the second element of the list `sng`)**
