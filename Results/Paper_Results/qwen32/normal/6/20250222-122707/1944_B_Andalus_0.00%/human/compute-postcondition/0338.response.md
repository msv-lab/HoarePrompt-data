Output State: **`sz` is either 2, 4, 6, or the value remains unchanged if it was already greater than or equal to `k`. `rdb` must contain at least two elements, and `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `rdb` or `elem`.**

In simpler terms, `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` was initially 0, it becomes 2; if `sz` was initially 2, it becomes 4; if `sz` was initially 4, it becomes 6. If `sz` was already greater than or equal to `k`, it remains unchanged. The other conditions regarding `rdb` and `elem` stay the same.
