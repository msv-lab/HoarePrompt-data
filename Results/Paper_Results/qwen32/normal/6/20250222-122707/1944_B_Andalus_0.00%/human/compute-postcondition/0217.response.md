Postcondition: **`sz` is an integer and `sng` is a list where the first `k` elements have been printed. `rdb` is a list that must have at least 1 element. If `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is updated to `sz + 2`. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged. If `sz >= k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `sz >= k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

To simplify and make it more understandable:

Postcondition: **`sz` is an integer and `sng` is a list where the first `k` elements have been printed. `rdb` is a list with at least 1 element. If `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is updated to `sz + 2`; otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged. If `sz >= k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
