The code snippet provided is `sz += 2`, which increments the variable `sz` by 2. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `sz`, we will denote the new value of `sz` as its previous value plus 2.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst` with at least one pair of consecutive identical elements, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index n to the end, `ldb` contains all elements that appear twice consecutively in `lft`, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively, `i` is `n`, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, and `sz` is its previous value plus 2.**
