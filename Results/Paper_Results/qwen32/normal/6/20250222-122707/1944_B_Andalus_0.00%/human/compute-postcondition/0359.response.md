Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing half the length of the list, an integer `k` representing a constraint, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function returns a value based on these inputs for each test case.**
