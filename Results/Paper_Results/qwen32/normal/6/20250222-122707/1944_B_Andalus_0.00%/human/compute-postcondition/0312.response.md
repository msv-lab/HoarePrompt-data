The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sng` list. If there are more elements in `sng`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `sz` is an integer incremented by 2 and still less than `k`, `k` is an integer, and `elem` is the next element in `sng`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have another element that can be assigned to `elem`.

State: **`sz` is an integer incremented by 2 and still less than `k`, `k` is an integer, and `elem` is the next element in `sng`**.

Since `elem` is the next element in `sng` at the start of the next iteration, we need to reflect that `elem` will be updated to the subsequent element in `sng`.

State: **`sz` is an integer incremented by 2 and still less than `k`, `k` is an integer, and `elem` is the next element in `sng`**.

To be more specific about the transition:
- `sz` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration (incremented by 2 and still less than `k`).
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `elem` is updated to the next element in `sng`.

Since the problem specifies that `sz` is incremented by 2 and still less than `k`, and `elem` is the next element in `sng`, we can conclude:

State: **`sz` is an integer incremented by 2 and still less than `k`, `k` is an integer, and `elem` is the next element in `sng`**.

However, to clearly indicate the next state of `elem`:

State: **`sz` is an integer incremented by 2 and still less than `k`, `k` is an integer, and `elem` is the subsequent element in `sng`**.
