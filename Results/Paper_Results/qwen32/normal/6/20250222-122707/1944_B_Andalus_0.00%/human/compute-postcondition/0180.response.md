Postcondition: **`sz` is either 0, 2, or 4; all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`; `rdb` is a list containing elements from `rgt[1]` to `rgt[n-1]` that are equal to their preceding element; `T` is greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `k` is the second integer from the input; `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end; `ldb` is a list containing at least two elements; `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position; `i` is `n-1`; `elem` is the third element in `ldb`. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is set to 2. If `k - sz < 2`, `sz` remains unchanged.**
