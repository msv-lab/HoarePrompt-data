The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which is iterated over `ldb`. Therefore, the state of `ldb` is the only one that can be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. For the loop to execute, `ldb` must contain at least one element.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`sz` is 0, `all elements up to the point where sz equals k have been printed from sng`, `rdb` is a list containing elements from `rgt[1]` to `rgt[n-1]` that are equal to their preceding element, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is a list containing at least one element, `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position, and `i` is `n-1`**
