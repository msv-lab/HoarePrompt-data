The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. No other variables are modified in this snippet.

Output State: **`ans_list` contains the previous values of `ans` plus the new value of `ans`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the remaining iterations not completed minus 1, and `k` is 0 if exhausted; `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Natural language description: The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the input. The values of `ans_list`, `ans`, and `res` remain as they were before, except that `k` is now set to the second integer from the input.
