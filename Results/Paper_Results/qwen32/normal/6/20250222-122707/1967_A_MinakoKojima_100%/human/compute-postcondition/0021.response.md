Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` are integers provided by the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input, `ans` is the smallest element in the list `a` plus `k // (i + 1)`, `i` is 0 or not 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]` and `dif` is not equal to 0, `res` is `n - 1` if `i` is 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 1 + k % (i + 1)`, and `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`**
