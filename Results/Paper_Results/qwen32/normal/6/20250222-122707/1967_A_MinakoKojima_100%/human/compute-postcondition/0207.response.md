The `print(a)` statement will print the first element of the list `ans_list`. According to the initial state, `a` is defined as the first element in `ans_list`.

Since the exact contents of `ans_list` are not provided, we can't determine the specific numerical or string value of `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of the first element in `ans_list`.

Output: **a (where a is the first element of the list `ans_list`)**
