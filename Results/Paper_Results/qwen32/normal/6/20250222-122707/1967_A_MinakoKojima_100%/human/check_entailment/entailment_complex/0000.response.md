Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem. The program aims to calculate the maximum score you can get by rearranging cards after potentially purchasing additional cards from the shop. The score is defined as the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` which are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Reasoning:

The program follows these steps:

1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of distinct card types) and `k` (number of coins). It also reads the list `a` which contains the initial count of each card type.

2. **Sorting**: It sorts the list `a` to handle the smallest counts first. This is a strategic step, as it allows the program to first balance the smallest counts to make as many permutations as possible.

3. **Balancing Counts**: It iterates over the sorted list to balance the counts by using the available coins `k`. The goal is to make the counts as equal as possible to maximize the number of permutations.

4. **Calculating the Answer**:
   - It calculates the answer as the sum of the smallest count plus any additional cards that can be added to make the counts more balanced.
   - It then adds the number of remaining coins divided by `n` to the answer, which represents the additional full permutations that can be formed.
   - It also adds the remainder of the remaining coins divided by `n` to the answer, which represents the additional partial permutations that can be formed.

5. **Output**: It prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

The program's logic seems to be correct based on the given problem statement and the provided test cases. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the logic works:

- **Sorting**: Sorting the list `a` is a good strategy because it allows the program to first balance the smallest counts, which is crucial for forming permutations.
- **Balancing Counts**: The loop iterates through the sorted list and uses the available coins `k` to balance the counts. This is done by adding coins to the counts in a way that maximizes the number of permutations.
- **Calculating the Answer**: The final calculation of the answer considers both the balanced counts and any remaining coins, ensuring that all possible permutations are counted.

The provided test cases match the expected outputs, which further supports the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided reasoning and the analysis of the program's logic and output, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
