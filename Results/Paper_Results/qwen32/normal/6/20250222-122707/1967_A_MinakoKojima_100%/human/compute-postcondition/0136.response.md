The code snippet provided appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_list`. This means that `ans_list` will now contain the previous values of `ans` along with the new value that has just been calculated and assigned to `ans`.

The values of `ans`, `res`, and `k` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`ans_list` contains the previous values of `ans` plus the new value of `ans`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the remaining iterations not completed (or 0 if all completed), and `k` is 0 if exhausted.**

In simpler terms, `ans_list` now includes the latest value of `ans`, while `ans`, `res`, and `k` retain their previous values.
