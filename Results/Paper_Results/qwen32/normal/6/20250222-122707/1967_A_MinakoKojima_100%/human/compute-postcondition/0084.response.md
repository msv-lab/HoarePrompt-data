Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `a` is the newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the first element of `a` plus `dif`, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]` and `dif` is not 0, `res` is `n - 2`**

In simple terms, the value of `res` has been decreased by 1, making it `n - 2`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
