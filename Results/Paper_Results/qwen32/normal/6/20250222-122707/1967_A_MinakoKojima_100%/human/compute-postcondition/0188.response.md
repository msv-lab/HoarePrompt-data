The code snippet provided increments the variable `ans` by the integer division of `k` by `i + 1`. The values of `i`, `n`, `dif`, and `res` are not directly affected by this line of code unless `dif` is 0, which would have already been handled before this line. Therefore, we only need to update the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`**.
