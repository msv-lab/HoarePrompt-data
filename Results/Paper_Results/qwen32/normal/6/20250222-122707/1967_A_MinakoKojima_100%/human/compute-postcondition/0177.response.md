Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is `ans + dif`, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is updated to `ans + k // (i + 1)`. Additionally, if `i` is not 0, `res` is updated to `res + k % (i + 1)`. `k` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
