Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `dif` is not 0 and `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `dif` is not 0 and `k < dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, and if `i` is not 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`. If `k` becomes 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is 0.**
