Postcondition: **`ans_list` contains the previous values of `ans` plus the new value of `ans`. If `dif` is not 0, then `k` is 0. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)` was true before entering the if condition, then `ans` is updated to `a[0] + dif` and `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `a[0] + k // (i + 1)` and `res` is `(n - 1) + (k % (i + 1))` if `i` is not 0, and `res` is `n - 1` if `i` is 0. If `dif` is 0, then `res` is `n - 2` and `k` remains 0. `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2. `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input. `i` is either 0 or not 0. `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.**
