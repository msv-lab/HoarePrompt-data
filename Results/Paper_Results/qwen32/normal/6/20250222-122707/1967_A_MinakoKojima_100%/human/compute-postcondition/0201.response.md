Postcondition: **`ans_list` contains all previous values of `ans` plus the final value of `ans`. If `k` is not 0, then `ans` is the final accumulated value plus `k // n` and `res` is the final adjusted value plus `k % n`. If `k` is 0, `ans` and `res` remain unchanged. `k` is 0 or not 0, `n` is unchanged, and `a` is unchanged.**
