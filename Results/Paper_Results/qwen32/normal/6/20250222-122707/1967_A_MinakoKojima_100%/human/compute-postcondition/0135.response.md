The code snippet `ans += res` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `res`. The variables `res` and `k` are not modified by this operation, and `n` remains unchanged as well.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `res` is the remaining iterations not completed (or 0 if all completed), and `k` is 0 if exhausted.**
