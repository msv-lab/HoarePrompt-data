Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.**

Explanation: The variable `dif` is calculated as the difference between the elements at index `i + 1` and `i` of the list `a`. The values of `i` and `n` remain as specified in the initial state.
