The code snippet `ans += dif` updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `dif` to it. The values of `i`, `n`, and `dif` are not affected by this operation. The condition for `res` being decreased by 1 is not relevant to this specific code snippet, so it remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `ans` is `ans + dif`.**
