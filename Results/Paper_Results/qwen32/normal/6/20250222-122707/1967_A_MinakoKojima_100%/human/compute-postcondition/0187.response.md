Output State: **`i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1; `ans` is increased by `dif`. `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`. `res` is decreased by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `res` has been decreased by 1, while the values of `i`, `n`, `dif`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
