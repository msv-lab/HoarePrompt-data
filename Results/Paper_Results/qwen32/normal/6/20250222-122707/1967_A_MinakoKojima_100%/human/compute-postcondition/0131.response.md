The code `ans += k // n` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the integer division of `k` by `n` to it. The values of `res` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is updated as follows:

Output State: **`ans` is the final computed sum plus `k // n`, `res` is the remaining iterations not completed (or 0 if all completed), and `k` is not 0.**
