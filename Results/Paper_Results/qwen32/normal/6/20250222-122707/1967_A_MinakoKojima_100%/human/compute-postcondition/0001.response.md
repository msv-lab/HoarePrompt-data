In the given task, the for loop iterates over the number of test cases, which is specified by the variable `t`. The loop head contains only one variable `_` which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the number of test cases `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The other variables `n`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `ans_list` are initialized inside the loop and do not affect whether the loop starts executing or not.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
