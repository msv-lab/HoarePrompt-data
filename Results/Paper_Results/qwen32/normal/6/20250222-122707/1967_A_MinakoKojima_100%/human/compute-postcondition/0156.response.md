The code snippet provided is:

```
res += k % (i + 1)
```

This line modifies the value of `res` by adding the result of `k % (i + 1)` to it.

Given the initial state, `res` is initially `n - 1`. Therefore, the new value of `res` will be `(n - 1) + (k % (i + 1))`.

The other variables (`ans_list`, `ans`, `k`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `dif`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`ans_list` contains the previous values of `ans` plus the new value of `ans`; `ans` is updated to `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`; `res` is `(n - 1) + (k % (i + 1))`; `k` is 0 if exhausted; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `k` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input; `i` is not 0; `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]` and `dif` is not 0; `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`**
