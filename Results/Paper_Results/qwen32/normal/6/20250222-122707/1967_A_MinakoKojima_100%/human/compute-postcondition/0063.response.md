The value of `ans` is incremented by the integer division of `k` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are as per the input, `a` is the same sorted list, `ans` is updated by adding `k // n` to its previous value, `res` is `n - 1` minus the number of non-zero and zero differences, and `k` is not equal to 0.**
