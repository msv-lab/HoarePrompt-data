The given code snippet modifies the value of `ans` based on its current value and the value of `n`. The variables `res` and `k` are not affected by this code snippet. Here's the updated state after the code executes:

Output State: **`ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, `res` is the remaining iterations not completed (or 0 if all completed), and `k` is 0 if exhausted.**

In simpler terms, `ans` is recalculated as its original value plus the product of one less than its original value and one less than `n`. The values of `res` and `k` remain unchanged.
