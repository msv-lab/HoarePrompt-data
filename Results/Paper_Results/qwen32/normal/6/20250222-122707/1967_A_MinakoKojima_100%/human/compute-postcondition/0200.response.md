The code snippet `res += k % n` updates the value of `res` by adding the remainder of `k` divided by `n` to it. The values of `ans_list`, `ans`, `k`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans_list` contains all previous values of `ans` plus the final value of `ans`; `ans` is the final accumulated value plus `k // n`; `res` is the final adjusted value plus `k % n`; `k` is not 0; `n` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged.**
