You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's) with length 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5. The sum of lengths of all strings s over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `n` times, and for each execution, it will have processed a binary string `s`. The variable `ans` will hold the accumulated score for the current binary string `s` after processing all its digits according to the rules specified in the loop. The variables `t` and `n` will remain unchanged from their initial values, as they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it accepts a binary string `s` with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, consisting only of '0's and '1's. The sum of the lengths of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns the result for each test case based on the binary string `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
