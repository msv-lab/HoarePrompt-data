### Reasoning:

The given program is supposed to calculate the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The core logic of the program is implemented in the `func_1` function.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `zeroes` counts the total number of '0's in the string.
   - `cnt` is a list that keeps track of the count of '0's and '1's encountered so far in the string.
   - `ans` is the variable that accumulates the total cost.

2. **Processing the string**:
   - For each character `c` in the string:
     - Update the count of the current character in `cnt`.
     - If the character is '0':
       - Add 1 to `ans` if there have been any '1's encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`). This is because placing a '0' before a '1' requires a cost.
     - If the character is '1':
       - Add the number of remaining '0's to `ans` (`zeroes - cnt[0]`). This is because moving a '1' past all remaining '0's requires a cost proportional to the number of those '0's.

3. **Output**:
   - The accumulated cost `ans` is printed for each test case.

The logic seems to be based on the idea of counting the cost of moving '1's past '0's, which aligns with the problem description. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The program does not correctly account for the cost of cyclic shifts. The cost should be based on the length of the substring being shifted, not just the number of '0's or '1's being moved past each other.

For example, consider the string "101011". The program would incorrectly calculate the cost as 5, but the correct minimum cost is 5, which can be achieved by a series of shifts that involve substrings of varying lengths. The provided program does not handle the cost of these shifts correctly.

### Correctness:

Given the explanation above, the program's logic does not fully align with the problem's requirements for calculating the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
