The code snippet provided increments the variable `ans` by 1 if the second element of the list `cnt` is greater than 0. Given the initial state, `cnt` is `[0, 0]` with one of its elements incremented by 1. This means `cnt` could be either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`.

If `cnt` is `[0, 1]`, then `cnt[1] > 0` is true, and `ans` will be incremented by 1. If `cnt` is `[1, 0]`, then `cnt[1] > 0` is false, and `ans` will remain 0.

Since we know one of the elements in `cnt` is incremented by 1, the only change to the variables is the potential increment of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the newly input string and must have at least 1 element, `n` is `n-1`, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[0, 0]` with one of its elements incremented by 1, `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1] > 0` else 0, and `c` is 0.**
