Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the original string and must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1]. If `c` is 0, then `ans` is 1 if `cnt` is [1, 0] else 0. If `c` is not 0, then `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.**
