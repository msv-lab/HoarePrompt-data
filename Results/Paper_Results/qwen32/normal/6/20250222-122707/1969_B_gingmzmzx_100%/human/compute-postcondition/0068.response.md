The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the element of the list `cnt` at the index specified by the variable `c` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` can either be `[0, 2]`, `[2, 0]`, or `[1, 1]` depending on the previous incrementation. Since `c` is the next element in the list `s`, and `s` consists of binary digits (0 or 1), `c` can only be 0 or 1.

If `c` is 0, then `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 1, then `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1.

Thus, the updated value of `cnt` will be:
- `[1, 2]` if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was `[0, 2]`
- `[2, 1]` if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was `[2, 0]`
- `[2, 2]` if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was `[1, 1]`
- `[2, 2]` if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was `[1, 1]`

Since `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s` and `c` is the next element, if `c` is 0, `zeroes` will be incremented by 1. If `c` is 1, `zeroes` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the newly input string and must have at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s` incremented by 1 if `c` is 0, `cnt` is `[1, 2]` if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was `[0, 2]`, `[2, 1]` if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was `[2, 0]`, or `[2, 2]` if `c` was 0 or 1 and `cnt` was `[1, 1]`, `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
