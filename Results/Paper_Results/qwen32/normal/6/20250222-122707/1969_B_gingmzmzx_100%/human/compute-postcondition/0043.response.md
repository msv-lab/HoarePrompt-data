The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` can be either `[2, 0]`, `[0, 2]`, or `[1, 1]`, and `c` is the next element in `s` after the previously processed element, which means `c` can be either 0 or 1.

Let's consider the possible states after the execution of the code snippet:

1. If `cnt` was `[2, 0]` and `c` is 0, then `cnt` becomes `[3, 0]`.
2. If `cnt` was `[2, 0]` and `c` is 1, then `cnt` becomes `[2, 1]`.
3. If `cnt` was `[0, 2]` and `c` is 0, then `cnt` becomes `[1, 2]`.
4. If `cnt` was `[0, 2]` and `c` is 1, then `cnt` becomes `[0, 3]`.
5. If `cnt` was `[1, 1]` and `c` is 0, then `cnt` becomes `[2, 1]`.
6. If `cnt` was `[1, 1]` and `c` is 1, then `cnt` becomes `[1, 2]`.

Other variables like `t`, `s`, `n`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State can be one of the following:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the input string and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [3, 0] if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was [2, 0], or [2, 1] if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was [2, 0], or [1, 2] if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was [0, 2], or [0, 3] if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was [0, 2], or [2, 1] if `c` was 0 and `cnt` was [1, 1], or [1, 2] if `c` was 1 and `cnt` was [1, 1], `c` is the next element in `s` after the previously processed element.**
