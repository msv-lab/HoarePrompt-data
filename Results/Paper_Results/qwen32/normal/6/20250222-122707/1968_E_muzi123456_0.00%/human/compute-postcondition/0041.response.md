To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how the variables change throughout its execution.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print('1', end=' ')
    print(i)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n` (inclusive).
- For each iteration, the loop prints `1` followed by the current value of `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1` (this value does not change within the loop)
- `n` is an input integer
- `i` is `n + 1` (this is the initial value before the loop starts, but inside the loop, `i` is controlled by the `range` function)

The loop will execute `n` times, and after the loop finishes, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop variable `i` in the `range` function is incremented until it reaches `n + 1`, at which point the loop terminates.

Thus, the final state after all the iterations will be:
- `t` remains `t - 1` (unchanged)
- `n` remains the input integer (unchanged)
- `i` will be `n + 1` (since the loop runs from 1 to `n` and `i` is incremented to `n + 1` after the loop ends)

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n + 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `t` remains `t - 1` (as it was initially), the value of `n` remains unchanged from the input, and the value of `i` is `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n` and stops when `i` reaches `n + 1`.
