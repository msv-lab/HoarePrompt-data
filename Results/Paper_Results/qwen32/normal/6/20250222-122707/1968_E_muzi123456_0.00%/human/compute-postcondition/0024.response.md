The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be at least 3 to ensure the loop continues.

State: **`t` is `t - 1` (must be greater than 0), `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3**
