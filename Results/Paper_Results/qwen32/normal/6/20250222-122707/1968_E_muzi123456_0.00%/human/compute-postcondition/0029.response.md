The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy (i.e., greater than 0), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1` (must be greater than 0). This means that `t` was at least 1 before the decrement, and after the decrement, it is still greater than 0.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1 before the decrement, so that after the decrement, it remains greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`**
