Let's analyze the given initial state step by step:

- `t` is defined as `t - 1` and must be greater than 0. However, the value of `t` before the operation is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value. The only requirement is that after the operation, `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be at least 1. Again, the exact value of `n` is not provided, but it is guaranteed to be 1 or greater.
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.

The `print(i)` statement will print the current value of `i`. Since `i` is explicitly set to 2, the value to be printed is clearly defined.

Output: **2**
