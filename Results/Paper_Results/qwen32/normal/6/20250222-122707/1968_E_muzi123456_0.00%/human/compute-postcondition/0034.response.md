Let's analyze the provided initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is `t - 1` - This statement suggests that `t` is being updated to `t - 1`, but since we don't have an initial value for `t`, we can't determine its exact value. However, this operation does not affect the variable `i` or the print statement.
2. `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 - This is a condition on the variable `n`, but it does not affect the variable `i` or the print statement.
3. `i` is 1 - This explicitly sets the value of `i` to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
- The print statement `print(i)` will output the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is explicitly set to 1, the print statement will output the value 1.

Output: **1**
