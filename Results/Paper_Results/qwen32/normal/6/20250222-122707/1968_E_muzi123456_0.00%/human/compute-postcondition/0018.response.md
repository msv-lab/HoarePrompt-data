To determine the required state adjustments for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variables `i` and the range parameters `1` and `n + 1`.

The loop will execute if the range `(1, n + 1)` is valid, meaning `n + 1` must be greater than `1`. This implies that `n` must be at least `1`. 

Let's analyze the provided state before the loop starts:
- `t` is `t - 1` (must be greater than 0)
- `n` is an input integer
- `i` is `n + 1`

Given the loop head `for i in range(1, n + 1):`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `1` for the loop to execute. The value of `i` before the loop starts, which is `n + 1`, does not affect the loop execution directly as `i` is reassigned at the start of each iteration. However, to ensure consistency and correctness, we should set `i` to a value that does not interfere with the loop's initial conditions. Typically, `i` is set to the starting value of the range, which is `1`, before the loop starts.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- Ensure `n` is at least `1` so that `n + 1` is greater than `1`.
- Set `i` to `1` before the loop starts.

The state before the loop starts should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`t` is `t - 1` (must be greater than 0), `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1**
