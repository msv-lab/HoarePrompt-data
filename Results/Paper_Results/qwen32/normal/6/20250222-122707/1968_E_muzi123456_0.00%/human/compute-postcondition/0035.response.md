The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
