Let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is defined as `t - 1`, but the initial value of `t` is not provided.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is explicitly set to 2.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement is instructed to print the string `'1'`.
- The `end=' '` parameter specifies that after printing `'1'`, the print function should end with a space instead of a newline.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
