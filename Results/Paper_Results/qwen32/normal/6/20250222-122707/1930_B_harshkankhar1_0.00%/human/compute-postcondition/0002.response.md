To determine what will be printed, we need to understand how the list `a` is constructed based on the given precondition. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is the length of the permutation `p` where `3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`.
   - `t` is the number of test cases where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`.
   - `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with elements at even indices reversed.

2. **Construction of List `a`**:
   - The list `a` is initially created as a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - Elements at even indices in this list are then reversed. In Python, indices start at 0, so even indices are 0, 2, 4, etc.

3. **Example**:
   - Let's say `n = 5`. The initial list `a` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - Elements at even indices are 1 (index 0), 3 (index 2), and 5 (index 4). Reversing these elements results in the list `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

4. **General Case**:
   - For any `n`, the list `a` will start as `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
   - The elements at even indices will be reversed. This means the first, third, fifth, etc., elements will be in reverse order compared to their original positions.

5. **Output**:
   - The `print(a)` statement will output the list `a` after the transformation described above.

Given the above understanding, the output of the print statement can be described as follows:

Output: **a (where a is the list of integers from 1 to n with elements at even indices reversed)**

This description is precise and adheres to the format specified.
