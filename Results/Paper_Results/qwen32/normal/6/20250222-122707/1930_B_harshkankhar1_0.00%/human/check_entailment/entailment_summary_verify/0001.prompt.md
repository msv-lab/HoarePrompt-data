You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). For each test case, it creates a list of integers from 1 to `n`, reverses the elements at even indices, and prints the modified list. The first line of the input specifies the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to n such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it generates a permutation of numbers from 1 to n by reversing the elements at even indices.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \).
2. It creates a list `a` containing numbers from 1 to \( n \).
3. It reverses the elements at even indices in the list `a`.
4. It prints the modified list `a`.

Let's look at the transformation in detail:
- For \( n = 4 \), the list `a` initially is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- After reversing the elements at even indices (0-based), the list becomes `[4, 2, 1, 3]`.
- For \( n = 3 \), the list `a` initially is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- After reversing the elements at even indices (0-based), the list remains `[1, 2, 3]`.

### Verification:
We need to verify whether the generated permutations meet the problem's requirement.

1. **For \( n = 4 \):**
   - Generated permutation: `[4, 2, 1, 3]`
   - Check pairs:
     - \( p_1 = 4 \), \( p_2 = 2 \), \( p_3 = 1 \), \( p_4 = 3 \)
     - No pair \( (i, j) \) satisfies \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **For \( n = 3 \):**
   - Generated permutation: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Check pairs:
     - \( p_1 = 1 \), \( p_2 = 2 \), \( p_3 = 3 \)
     - No pair \( (i, j) \) satisfies \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

The given program seems to generate a permutation that avoids the condition \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \) for the example cases. However, we need to ensure this is true for all \( n \geq 3 \).

### General Case:
The program's approach of reversing elements at even indices is a heuristic that works for small values of \( n \) but does not guarantee a solution for all \( n \). For instance, for larger \( n \), it might still produce a permutation that does not meet the criteria.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided examples and the general approach, we cannot conclusively state that the program will always generate a valid permutation for all \( n \geq 3 \). Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs.
