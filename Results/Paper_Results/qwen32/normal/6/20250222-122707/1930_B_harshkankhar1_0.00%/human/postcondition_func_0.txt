The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). For each test case, it creates a list of integers from 1 to `n`, reverses the elements at even indices, and prints the modified list. The first line of the input specifies the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
