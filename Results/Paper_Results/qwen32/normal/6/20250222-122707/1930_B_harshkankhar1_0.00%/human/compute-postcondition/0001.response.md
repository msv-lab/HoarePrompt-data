The code snippet `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices in the list `a`. Let's break down the changes:

- `a[::2]` selects all the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) in the list `a`.
- `a[::2][::-1]` reverses the selected elements.
- The reversed elements are then assigned back to the even indices in the list `a`.

For example, if `a` was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, after the operation, `a` would become `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

Since the code only affects the elements at even indices, the elements at odd indices remain unchanged.

Output State: **Each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation p. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) indicating the number of test cases. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n with elements at even indices reversed.**
