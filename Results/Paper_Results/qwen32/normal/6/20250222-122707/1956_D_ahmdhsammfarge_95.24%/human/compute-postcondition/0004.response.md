The code snippet appends the list `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the `ops` list, regardless of the conditions mentioned in the initial state. The values of `r`, `l`, `lst`, and the condition regarding the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers, with the additional element `[r + 1, r + 1]` appended to it. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the list `ops` will have the element `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended to it. Otherwise, `ops` remains unchanged, except that `[r + 1, r + 1]` has been appended to it.**
