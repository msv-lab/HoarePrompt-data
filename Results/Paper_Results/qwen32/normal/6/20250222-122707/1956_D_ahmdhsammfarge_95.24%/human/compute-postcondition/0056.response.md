To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand what the loop is doing. The loop is iterating over all possible pairs \((i, j)\) where \(i < j\) and calculating a sum expression. The sum expression is given by:

\[ \text{sm} = \text{sum}(\text{lst}[:i]) + \text{sum}(\text{lst}[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)^2 \]

The loop keeps track of the pair \((i, j)\) that maximizes this sum expression. Specifically, it updates the values of `r` and `l` to the indices \((i, j)\) that yield the maximum sum, and `over_sum` to the maximum sum found so far.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `r` and `l` initialized to 0, and `over_sum` initialized to the sum of all elements in `lst`.

2. **First Iteration**: The loop starts with `i = 0` and iterates over `j` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`. It calculates `sm` for each `j` and updates `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` if the calculated `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.

3. **Subsequent Iterations**: For each subsequent `i`, the loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`, again calculating `sm` for each `j` and updating `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` if the calculated `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.

After all iterations, `r` and `l` will hold the indices \((i, j)\) that maximize the sum expression, and `over_sum` will hold the maximum value of the sum expression.

**Output State**: After all iterations, `r` and `l` will be the indices \((i, j)\) that maximize the sum expression `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)^2`, and `over_sum` will be the maximum value of this sum expression.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are the indices that maximize the sum expression `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)^2`, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of this sum expression.**

In simpler terms, `r` and `l` are the starting and ending indices of the subarray that, when removed and replaced with a square of its length, results in the maximum possible sum. `over_sum` is this maximum possible sum.
