The code snippet assigns the value of `l - r + 1` to the variable `n`. The values of `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops` remain unchanged. The value of `n` represents the length of the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]`.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst); `lst` is a list of integers; `ops` is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers, with the additional element `[r + 1, r + 1]` appended to it, and if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, `[r + 1, l + 1]` is also appended to `ops`. `[r + 1, l + 1]` has been appended to `ops`; `n` is the integer `l - r + 1`.**
