The code assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. The value of `sm` is given as `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with more than 1 element; `i` is 0; `r` is 0; `l` is 1; `j` is 1; `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`; `over_sum` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`.**
