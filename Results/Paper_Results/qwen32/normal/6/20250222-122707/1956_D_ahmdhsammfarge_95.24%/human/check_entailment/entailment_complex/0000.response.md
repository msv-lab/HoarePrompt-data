### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iteratively modifying the array to maximize its sum using the allowed operations. Let's break down the functionality of each function and how they work together to achieve the goal.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds the subarray `[i, j]` in `lst` that maximizes the sum expression `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`.
   - The idea is to find a subarray that, when replaced with its MEX value, would yield the maximum possible sum increase.
   - This function returns the indices `r` and `l` of the subarray that maximizes the sum expression.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is supposed to append specific operations to the `ops` list based on the values of `r` and `l`.
   - However, the recursive calls and the way `func_2` is structured do not seem to follow a logical pattern for generating operations that would help in maximizing the sum.
   - The recursive calls to `func_2(r, l - 1, ops)` and the subsequent operations do not clearly contribute to the goal of maximizing the sum.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function performs the operation on the subarray `[r, l]` by setting all elements in this subarray to the length of the subarray `n = l - r + 1`.
   - It appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`.
   - If the minimum value in the subarray is 0, it appends another operation `[r + 1, l + 1]`.
   - It then calls `func_2(r, l, ops)` which, as mentioned, does not seem to contribute logically to the goal.
   - Finally, it appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` again and modifies the subarray in `lst`.

4. **Main Execution:**
   - The main execution starts by reading the input list `lst`.
   - It then enters a loop where it repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the subarray that maximizes the sum expression and `func_3` to perform the operation on that subarray.
   - The loop continues until `r` equals `l`, indicating no further subarray can be improved.
   - After the loop, it tries to find any remaining zeros in `lst` and replaces them with 1, appending the corresponding operations to `ops`.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the modified `lst` and the number of operations.

### Issues:
- The logic in `func_2` is unclear and does not seem to contribute to the goal of maximizing the sum.
- The recursive calls in `func_2` do not follow a logical pattern and may lead to incorrect or unnecessary operations.
- The overall approach of finding the subarray that maximizes the sum expression and performing operations on it seems correct in theory, but the implementation details in `func_2` are problematic.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with `func_2` and the unclear logic in generating operations, the program may not always produce the correct sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array. While the main idea is correct, the implementation details are flawed, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

**Correctness: False**
