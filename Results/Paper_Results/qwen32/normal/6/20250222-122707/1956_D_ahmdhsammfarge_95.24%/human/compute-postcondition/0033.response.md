Output State: **`r` is 0, `l` is an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`, `i` is `l + 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`**

In this output state, the values of `r`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The new variable `sm` is calculated as the sum of elements in `lst` from the start up to (but not including) index `i`, plus the sum of elements in `lst` from index `j + 1` to the end, plus the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus one.
