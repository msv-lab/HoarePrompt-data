The given code snippet modifies the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) by replacing it with a list of `n` elements, where each element is the value of `n`. Since `n` is defined as `l - r + 1`, the sublist is replaced by a list of `n` elements, all of which are `n`.

Let's break down the changes:
- The sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is replaced with `[n, n, ..., n]` (a list of `n` elements, all `n`).
- The length of the sublist remains the same (`n` elements), and its values are all set to `n`.
- The variables `r`, `l`, `lst`, `ops`, and `n` are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst); `lst` is a list of integers where `lst[r:l + 1]` is now `[n, n, ..., n]` (a list of `n` elements, all `n`); `ops` is a list that will store operations as lists of two integers, with the additional element `[r + 1, r + 1]` appended to it, and if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` was 0, `[r + 1, l + 1]` is also appended to `ops`; `n` is the integer `l - r + 1`.**
