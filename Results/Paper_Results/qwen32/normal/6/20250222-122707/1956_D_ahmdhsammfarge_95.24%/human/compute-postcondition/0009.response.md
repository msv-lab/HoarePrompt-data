Output State: **The program returns a list `lst` where the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) consists of `n` elements, all of which are `n`.**

This means that the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` in the list `lst` is now a sequence of `n` repeated `n` times, where `n` is the length of this sublist, calculated as `l - r + 1`.
