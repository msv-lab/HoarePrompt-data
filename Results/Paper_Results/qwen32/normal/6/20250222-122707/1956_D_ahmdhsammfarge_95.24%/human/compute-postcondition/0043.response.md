The value of `over_sum` is updated to the value of `sm`. The values of `r`, `l`, and `sm` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, and `over_sum` is equal to `sm`.

Output State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, and `over_sum` is equal to `sm`.**
