The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement, `j` iterates over the range starting from `i + 1` up to `len(lst)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has taken a value, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, provided it is still within the bounds of the range.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `r` is the value of `l + 1`
- `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations.
- If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is updated to `i`, `l` is updated to `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`.
- `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`.
- `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `len(lst)`.

State: **`r` is the value of `l + 1`, `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations, `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `j` is less than `len(lst)`**.
