### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's correctness based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Handling**: The function reads the input data and processes each test case. It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
- **Function Call**: For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and stores the result.
- **Output Generation**: After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Score Calculation**: This function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by calling `calculate_score` for each of their starting positions (`PB` and `PS`).
- **Comparison**: It compares the scores and returns the appropriate winner or 'Draw' if the scores are equal.

#### Function `calculate_score`:
- **Cycle Detection**: This function is designed to efficiently calculate the score for a given starting position. It uses a dictionary `visited` to track the steps at which each position is visited.
- **Cycle Handling**: If a position is visited again (indicating a cycle), it calculates the cycle length and the total score for the remaining steps by considering full cycles and any remaining steps.
- **Score Calculation**: The function correctly accumulates the score by adding the value of `a` at the current position and moving to the position indicated by `p` unless the player decides to stay.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations provide a detailed state of the program at key points, which align with the expected behavior described in the function comments.
- The annotations confirm that the function handles cycles correctly and efficiently computes the score for large values of `k`.

### Evaluation:
The annotations and the code logic align with the problem description and handle all edge cases, including large values of `k` by detecting cycles. The program correctly processes input, calculates scores, and outputs the results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
