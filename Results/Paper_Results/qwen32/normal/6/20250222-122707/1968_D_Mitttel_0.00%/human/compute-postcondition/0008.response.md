The code snippet `k = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `k` by converting the string at `data[index + 1]` to an integer. Given that `index` is 1, `k` is now assigned the integer value of `data[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**.
