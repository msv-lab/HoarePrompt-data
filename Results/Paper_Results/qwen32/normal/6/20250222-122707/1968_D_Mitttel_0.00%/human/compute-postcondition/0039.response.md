Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `13 + 6n`, `t` is `t + 1` (and must be greater than 0), and `results` is a list containing the updated `result`, where `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`; `results` now includes the new `result` appended to it.**

In natural language: The value of `index` is incremented by `n`, making it `13 + 6n`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `data`, `t`, and `results`) retain their previous values, except `index` which has been updated.
