Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - It correctly splits the input into the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case with the appropriate parameters.

2. **Score Calculation (`calculate_score`)**:
   - The function `calculate_score` calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It keeps track of the current position, the score, and the number of steps taken.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by considering the cycle's score and the number of full cycles and remaining steps within the cycle.
   - This logic is correct for handling both acyclic and cyclic permutations.

3. **Comparison of Scores (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both players (Bodya and Sasha) and compares their scores.
   - It returns the correct result based on the comparison: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".

### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case independently.
- The logic for calculating the score, including handling cycles, is correct.
- The comparison of scores and the determination of the winner is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly implemented based on the problem description and handles the input and output as required.

**Correctness: True**
