To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the context provided.

### Analysis of Initial State:

1. **Variables and their Definitions:**
   - `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS` are integers derived from the `data` list at specific indices in the next iteration.
   - `p` and `a` are lists of integers derived from a slice of the `data` list in the next iteration.
   - `data` is a list of strings.
   - `index` is calculated as `1 + (4 + 2n) * 2`.
   - `t` is set to 2.
   - `results` is a list containing at least 3 results, where each result is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.
   - `result` is the third result in the `results` list.

2. **Specifics of the Print Statement:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the third element of the `results` list.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Determine the Value of `index`:**
   - `index` is calculated using the formula `1 + (4 + 2n) * 2`.
   - However, `n` is not explicitly known in the current state, but it will be known in the next iteration.
   - For the sake of understanding the print statement, we do not need the exact value of `index` but rather the value of `result`.

2. **Determine the Value of `result`:**
   - `result` is defined as the third element in the `results` list.
   - Each element in the `results` list is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
   - The exact value of `result` depends on the return value of `func_1` when called with specific arguments in the third iteration.

### Conclusion:

Given the information, the `print(result)` statement will output the third result stored in the `results` list. The exact value of `result` is dependent on the return value of `func_1` during the third iteration, which is not explicitly provided in the initial state.

Output: **result (where result is the third element in the results list, which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` in the third iteration)**
