To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's carefully analyze the pattern and the variables involved.

Given the loop structure and the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop runs until there are no more valid iterations based on the `index` calculation and the availability of data.

The key points are:
- `index` is calculated as `1 + (4 + 2n) * t`, where `t` is the iteration number starting from 0.
- The loop continues as long as there is enough data in the `data` list to support the calculations for `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
- The loop prints each result from the `results` list.

From the pattern, we can see that `t` increments by 1 with each iteration. Therefore, the final state will be when `t` reaches the maximum number of iterations possible given the constraints of the `data` list.

Let's denote the final iteration number as `T`. This means the loop will stop when `1 + (4 + 2n) * T` exceeds the length of the `data` list or when there is no more valid data to process.

The final output state will be:
- `n` will be the integer value of `data[index - 4]` in the last valid iteration.
- `k` will be the integer value of `data[index - 3]` in the last valid iteration.
- `PB` will be the integer value of `data[index - 2]` in the last valid iteration.
- `PS` will be the integer value of `data[index - 1]` in the last valid iteration.
- `p` will be a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the last valid iteration.
- `a` will be a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the last valid iteration.
- `data` will remain the same list of strings.
- `index` will be `1 + (4 + 2n) * T` in the last valid iteration.
- `t` will be `T`, the total number of valid iterations.
- `results` will be a list containing `T` results, where each result is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]` in the last valid iteration, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]` in the last valid iteration, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]` in the last valid iteration, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` in the last valid iteration, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the last valid iteration, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the last valid iteration, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `1 + (4 + 2n) * T` where `T` is the total number of valid iterations, `t` is `T`, and `results` is a list containing `T` results, where each result is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, the loop finishes when there is no more valid data to process, and the final state reflects the values from the last valid iteration and the total number of iterations completed.
