The value of `index` is incremented by 4. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**
