### Reasoning:

The program consists of three main functions, and their roles are as follows:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to determine the winner of the game based on the scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It calls `calculate_score` for both players' starting positions and compares their scores.
   - It returns 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of their scores.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting at a given position.
   - It traverses the permutation `p` up to `k` steps, accumulating the score from the array `a`.
   - If a cycle is detected (i.e., the player revisits a position), it calculates the score for the remaining steps by considering the cycle.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it parses the input values and calls `func_1` to determine the result.
   - It collects the results for all test cases and prints them.

### Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly determines the winner by comparing the scores returned by `calculate_score` for Bodya and Sasha.
  - The function is straightforward and follows the problem description accurately.

- **Function `calculate_score`**:
  - The function correctly handles the traversal of the permutation and the accumulation of scores.
  - It efficiently handles cycles by calculating the score for a complete cycle and then using it to compute the score for the remaining steps.
  - The function accounts for the possibility of reaching the end of the game before completing a cycle.
  
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly reads and parses the input.
  - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` and collects the results.
  - The function prints the results in the correct order.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, calculates the scores for both players, and determines the winner based on these scores. The functions work together seamlessly to provide the correct output for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
