To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. Let's break down the information step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS` are integers that will be derived from the `data` list in the next iteration.
   - `p` and `a` are lists of integers derived from a slice of the `data` list starting at `index` and extending for `n` elements.
   - `data` is a list of strings.
   - `index` is calculated as `1 + (4 + 2n) * 2`.
   - `t` is set to 2.
   - `results` is a list containing 2 results, each of which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.
   - `result` is the second result in the `results` list.

2. **Important Points:**
   - The exact values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, and `data` are not provided, so we cannot compute specific numerical values.
   - We know that `result` is the second element of the `results` list, which is the return value of `func_1` for the second iteration.

### Analysis

- **Index Calculation:**
  - The `index` is calculated as `1 + (4 + 2n) * 2`. Since `n` is not known, we cannot compute the exact `index`. However, this formula determines where the slices for `p` and `a` will start.

- **Slices for `p` and `a`:**
  - `p` and `a` are slices of `data` starting at `index` and extending for `n` elements. Since `data` is a list of strings and `n` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `p` and `a`.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The `results` list contains the return values of `func_1` for each iteration. Since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values returned by it.

- **Result:**
  - `result` is the second element of the `results` list. Since `results` contains the return values of `func_1`, `result` will be the return value of `func_1` for the second iteration.

### Conclusion

Given the lack of specific values for `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `data`, and the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`. However, we can describe its value in terms of the function call.

### Final Output

Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1 for the second iteration)**
