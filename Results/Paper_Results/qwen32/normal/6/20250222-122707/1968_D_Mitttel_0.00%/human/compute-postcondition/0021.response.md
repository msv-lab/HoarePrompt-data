Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[5:5 + n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `5 + 2n`, `t` is `t - 1` (and must be greater than 0), and `results` is a list containing `result`, where `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

Explanation: The value of `PB` has been updated to the integer value of `data[index + 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
