### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program to understand if it correctly implements the described solution.

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input in bulk and processes each test case.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints each result.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It then compares the scores and returns "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.

3. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a given starting position.
   - It iterates up to `k` steps, accumulating the score based on the values in array `a`.
   - It keeps track of visited positions to detect cycles.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the full cycles and the remaining steps within the cycle.
   - This ensures that the score is correctly calculated even if `k` is very large, as it avoids recalculating the score for repeated cycles.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly handles the input parsing and test case iteration.
- The `calculate_score` function correctly handles both the accumulation of scores and the detection of cycles to optimize the calculation.
- The comparison of scores in `func_1` is straightforward and correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It handles the input parsing, score calculation, and comparison accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
