Output State: **The program returns `score` which is the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each `current_pos` visited up to the `k`-th step plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]` for each of the `remainder_steps` if `cycle_start` is not equal to -1. If `cycle_start` is -1, the program returns the initial value of `score`, which is 0.**

This means that if `cycle_start` is not -1, the `score` includes contributions from the positions visited up to the `k`-th step, any full cycles completed, and any remaining steps within the cycle. If `cycle_start` is -1, no additional calculations are made to `score`, and it remains 0.
