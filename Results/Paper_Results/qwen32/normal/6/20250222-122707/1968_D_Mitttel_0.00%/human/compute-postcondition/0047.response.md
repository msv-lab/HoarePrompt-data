The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. If there are more elements in the `results` list, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `result` is the second result in the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least a third result in the `results` list. Therefore, `result` will be the third result in the `results` list in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]` in the next iteration, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]` in the next iteration, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]` in the next iteration, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` in the next iteration, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the next iteration, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the next iteration, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `1 + (4 + 2n) * 2`, `t` is 2, and `results` is a list containing at least 3 results, where each result is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration. `result` is the third result in the `results` list.**
