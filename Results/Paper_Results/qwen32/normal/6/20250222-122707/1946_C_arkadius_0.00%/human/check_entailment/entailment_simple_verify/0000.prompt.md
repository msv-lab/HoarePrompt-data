You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step-by-step according to the problem description and the provided code.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the maximum number `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges from a tree results in all remaining connected components having at least `x` vertices.

### Provided Program Analysis:

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The tree is represented using a class `Tree` (not provided in the snippet), which includes methods to add edges and root the tree.
   
2. **Functions**:
   - `func_1`: This function performs a post-order traversal of the tree to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
   - `func_2`: This function is similar to `func_1` and performs a post-order traversal to calculate the same values recursively.
   - `func_3`: This function checks if it is possible to have at least `k` good components with each component having at least `x` vertices.
   - `func_4`: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum possible value of `x`.
   - `func_5`: This function reads input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.

### Key Points to Consider:
- The program uses a binary search to find the maximum `x`, which is efficient given the constraints.
- The post-order traversal in `func_1` and `func_2` is used to correctly calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
- The `func_3` function checks the conditions for the components correctly.

### Potential Issues:
- The code assumes that the `Tree` class is correctly implemented and that it provides the necessary methods (`add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`).
- The code does not handle the case where the input does not form a valid tree (e.g., disconnected components, cycles).

### Testing the Program:
Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, let's check if the program handles all edge cases correctly.

### Example Test Cases:
1. **Example 1**: 
   - Input: `5 1\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Removing edge `1-3` results in components `{1, 2}` and `{3, 4, 5}`, both having at least 2 vertices.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `2 1\n1 2`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Removing the only edge results in two components `{1}` and `{2}`, each having at least 1 vertex.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `6 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Removing edge `2-3` results in components `{1, 2}` and `{3, 4, 5, 6}`, with the second component having at least 3 vertices.

4. **Edge Case**:
   - Input: `3 1\n1 2\n1 3`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Removing any edge results in two components, each having at least 1 vertex.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum `x` for the given problem constraints. It uses an efficient binary search approach and correctly handles the post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum `x` for the given problem constraints, handles the post-order traversal correctly, and uses a binary search to efficiently find the result. The program is consistent with the provided examples and edge cases.
