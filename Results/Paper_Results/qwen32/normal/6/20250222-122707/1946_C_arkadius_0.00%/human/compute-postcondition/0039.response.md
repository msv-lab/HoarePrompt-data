Output State: **`v` is the vertex that was last pushed onto the stack, `postorder` is the boolean value that was the second part of the last tuple on the stack, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class where `tree.vertices[v].children` contains at least one child, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, and `stack` contains the remaining tuples after the last tuple has been popped plus the new tuple `(v, True)` and the new tuple `(u, False)`. `u` is the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**

The output state reflects that the stack now includes an additional tuple `(u, False)`, where `u` is the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`. All other variables retain their initial state values.
