The value of `end` is updated to `mid - 1`. The values of `tree`, `n`, `k`, `beg`, and `mid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tree` is an object representing a tree with `n` vertices, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n, `beg` must be less than `end`, `mid` is `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, `end` is `mid - 1`.**
