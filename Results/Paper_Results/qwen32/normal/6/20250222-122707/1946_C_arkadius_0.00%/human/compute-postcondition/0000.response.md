The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree, and `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, with the condition that `1 <= k < n`.

After executing the code, the values of `n` and `k` will be the integers provided as input. The precondition that `1 <= k < n` still holds true after the input is read, assuming the input values satisfy this condition.

Output State: **`n` is the number of vertices in the tree as input, `k` is the number of edges to be removed as input, and `1 <= k < n`.**
