Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `v` is the first element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, and `stack` has one more tuple `(v, True)` than before.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `v` is the first element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class where `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `stack` has one more tuple `(v, True)` and one more tuple `(u, False)` than before.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `v` is the first element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class where `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `stack` has one more tuple `(v, True)`, one more tuple `(u, False)`, and one additional tuple `(u, False)` than before, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `v` is the first element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class where `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `stack` has one more tuple `(v, True)`, one more tuple `(u, False)`, and two additional tuples `(u, False)` than before, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children` after the current `u`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
