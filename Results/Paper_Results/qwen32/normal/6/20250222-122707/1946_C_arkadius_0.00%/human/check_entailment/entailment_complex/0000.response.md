### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Initialization:**
   - The `TreeNode` class initializes each node with an empty list of edges, children, and sets the `subtree_size` to 1. It also initializes `good_components` and `remaining_size` to 1.
   - The `Tree` class initializes a list of `TreeNode` objects representing the vertices of the tree.
   - The `add_edge` method adds undirected edges between vertices.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method roots the tree at a given vertex using an iterative approach, updating the `parent` and `children` for each node and calculating the `subtree_size`.

2. **Component Calculation:**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` both aim to calculate the number of "good components" and the remaining size of each vertex based on a given threshold `x`. These functions are essentially equivalent in functionality, but `func_1` uses an iterative approach with a stack, while `func_2` is recursive.
   - Both functions traverse the tree and update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` fields of each node. A "good component" is defined as a subtree with at least `x` vertices.
   - The return values of `func_1` and `func_2` are the `good_components` and `remaining_size` of the root vertex.

3. **Feasibility Check:**
   - `func_3` checks if it is possible to split the tree by removing `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices. It uses the results from `func_1` (or `func_2`).
   - If the number of `good_components` is greater than `k`, it returns `True`.
   - If the number of `good_components` is equal to `k` and the `remaining_size` is at least `x`, it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum x:**
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum value of `x` for which `func_3` returns `True`. It initializes `beg` to 1 and `end` to `n` and iteratively adjusts these values based on the result of `func_3`.

5. **Main Function:**
   - `func_5` reads input values for `n` and `k`, constructs the tree, roots it at vertex 0, and then calls `func_4` to determine the maximum `x`.
   - The result of `func_4` is printed, which is the desired output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`. The iterative and recursive approaches in `func_1` and `func_2` are functionally equivalent, and the binary search in `func_4` efficiently finds the maximum valid `x`.

**Correctness: True**
