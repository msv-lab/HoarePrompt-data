The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Given that `i` starts at 1 and `n` is at least 2, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed such that `1 <= k < n`, `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices and includes an additional edge between vertices `u - 1` and `v - 1`, `u` and `v` are the two integers read from the input, `i` is 2**
