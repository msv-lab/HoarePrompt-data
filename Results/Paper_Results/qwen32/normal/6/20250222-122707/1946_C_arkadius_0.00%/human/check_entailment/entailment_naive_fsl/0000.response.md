To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step-by-step according to the problem description and the provided code.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the maximum number `x` such that removing exactly `k` edges from a tree results in all remaining connected components having at least `x` vertices.

### Provided Program Analysis:

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The tree is represented using a class `Tree` (not provided in the snippet), which includes methods to add edges and root the tree.
   
2. **Functions**:
   - `func_1`: This function performs a post-order traversal of the tree to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
   - `func_2`: This function is similar to `func_1` and performs a post-order traversal to calculate the same values recursively.
   - `func_3`: This function checks if it is possible to have at least `k` good components with each component having at least `x` vertices.
   - `func_4`: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum possible value of `x`.
   - `func_5`: This function reads input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.

### Key Points to Consider:
- The program uses a binary search to find the maximum `x`, which is efficient given the constraints.
- The post-order traversal in `func_1` and `func_2` is used to correctly calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
- The `func_3` function checks the conditions for the components correctly.

### Potential Issues:
- The code assumes that the `Tree` class is correctly implemented and that it provides the necessary methods (`add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`).
- The code does not handle the case where the input does not form a valid tree (e.g., disconnected components, cycles).

### Testing the Program:
Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, let's check if the program handles all edge cases correctly.

### Example Test Cases:
1. **Example 1**: 
   - Input: `5 1\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Removing edge `1-3` results in components `{1, 2}` and `{3, 4, 5}`, both having at least 2 vertices.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `2 1\n1 2`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Removing the only edge results in two components `{1}` and `{2}`, each having at least 1 vertex.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `6 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Removing edge `2-3` results in components `{1, 2}` and `{3, 4, 5, 6}`, with the second component having at least 3 vertices.

4. **Edge Case**:
   - Input: `3 1\n1 2\n1 3`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Removing any edge results in two components, each having at least 1 vertex.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum `x` for the given problem constraints. It uses an efficient binary search approach and correctly handles the post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum `x` for the given problem constraints, handles the post-order traversal correctly, and uses a binary search to efficiently find the result. The program is consistent with the provided examples and edge cases.
