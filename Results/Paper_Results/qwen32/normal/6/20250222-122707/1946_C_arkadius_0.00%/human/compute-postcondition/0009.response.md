The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the list `[u, v]`. This means that `u` and `v` will now hold the values of the two integers read from the input. The values of `n`, `k`, `tree`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed such that `1 <= k < n`, `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices and includes an additional edge between vertices `u - 1` and `v - 1`, `u` and `v` are the two new integers read from the input, `i` is 3**.
