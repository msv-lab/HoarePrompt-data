To determine the output of the `print(func_4(tree, n, k))` statement, we need to understand the context and the behavior of the `func_4` function. However, the function `func_4` is not defined in the provided initial state, so we can only infer the output based on the given information about the parameters `tree`, `n`, and `k`.

Here's the breakdown of the given information:

- `n` is at least 2.
- `k` is the number of edges to be removed such that `1 <= k < n`.
- `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges.
- The tree has been rooted at vertex `0` with `-1` as its parent.

Given these details, the function `func_4` could perform various operations related to the tree structure, such as removing edges, calculating certain properties, or transforming the tree in some way. However, without the definition of `func_4`, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's behavior based on these parameters.

Assuming `func_4` performs some operation on the tree and returns a result, the output will be dependent on the specific implementation of `func_4`. Since the exact behavior of `func_4` is not provided, we can only state that the output will be the result of this function applied to the given `tree`, `n`, and `k`.

Thus, the most precise description we can provide is:

Output: **result of `func_4(tree, n, k)` (where `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges rooted at vertex `0`, `n` is at least 2, and `k` is the number of edges to be removed such that `1 <= k < n`)**
