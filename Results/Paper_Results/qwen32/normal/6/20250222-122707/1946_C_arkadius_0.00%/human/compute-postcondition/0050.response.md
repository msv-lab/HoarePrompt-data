The code snippet `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` modifies the `remaining_size` attribute of the vertex `v` in the `tree` by adding the `remaining_size` of vertex `u` to it. 

Given that `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, the `remaining_size` of vertex `v` will be updated to its current value plus the `remaining_size` of vertex `u`.

Output State: **`v` is a vertex in `tree` that has at least one child, `postorder` is `True`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, and `stack` contains the remaining tuples after the last tuple has been popped. Additionally, `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of its previous value and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**
