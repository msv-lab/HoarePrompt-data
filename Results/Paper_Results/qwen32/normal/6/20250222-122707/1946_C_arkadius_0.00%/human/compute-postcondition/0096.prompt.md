Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `stack` is a list containing a single tuple `(s, False)`.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    if postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u
                ].good_components
            if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
                tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
            else:
                tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u
                    ].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree structure with vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, and `postorder` is `False`. If `postorder` is `False`, then `stack` is a list containing the tuple `(v, True)` and all tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list. Otherwise, `stack` remains an empty list. Since `postorder` is `False` in this case, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` are not updated in this block.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `v` is a vertex in `tree`, `postorder` is a boolean value, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, and `stack` contains the remaining tuples after the last tuple has been popped. If `postorder` is `True`, all children of `v` have been processed, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` reflects the sum of good components from all children of `v` plus 1 for each child whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` reflects the sum of `remaining_size` from all children of `v` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. If `postorder` is `False`, no further action is taken regarding `v` and its children.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `v` is a vertex in `tree` and `tree.vertices[v].children` is not empty. If `postorder` is not empty, `stack` has one less tuple than before, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to include the sum of its children's `good_components` and incremented by 1 for each child with a `remaining_size` greater than or equal to `x`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to the sum of its children's `remaining_size` that are less than `x`. `s` and `x` remain unchanged. If `postorder` is empty, `stack` has one more tuple `(v, True)` and as many tuples `(u, False)` as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and the state of `tree`, `s`, and `x` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
