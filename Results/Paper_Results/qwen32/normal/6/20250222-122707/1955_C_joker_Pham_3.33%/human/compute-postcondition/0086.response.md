Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`; `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`; `a[r]`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values. If `a[l]` is 0, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1. `sunks` is incremented by 1; `r` is decreased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `r` is decreased by 1. All other variables retain their original values or conditions, except that `r` is now one less than its original value.
