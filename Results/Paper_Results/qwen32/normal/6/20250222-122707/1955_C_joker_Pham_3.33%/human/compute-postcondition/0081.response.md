The code snippet `a[l] -= a[r]` decreases the value of `a[l]` by the value of `a[r]`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`; `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`; `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values.**
