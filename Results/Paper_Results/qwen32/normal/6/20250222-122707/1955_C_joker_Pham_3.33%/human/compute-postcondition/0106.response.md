Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r]` was originally 0, then `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `sunks` or `r`. `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2` and `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`.**
