Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r]` < `a[l]`, then: if `k` >= `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1; if `k` < `a[r] * 2`, and `k` is not 0, the values of `sunks`, `r`, `k`, `a[r]`, and `l` remain unchanged; if `k` is 0, no changes are made to `sunks`, `r`, `k`, `a[r]`, or `l`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; if `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. In all cases, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, no changes are made to `sunks`, `r`, `k`, `a[r]`, or `l`.**
