The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `l`, `r`, `k`, `a[r]`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` >= `a[r]` if `sunks` was incremented by 1 and the loop or if statement was broken out of, otherwise no changes are made to `sunks`.**
