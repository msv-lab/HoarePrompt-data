Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (before decrementing `r`), `k` and `a[r]` remain unchanged, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. The conditions and states provided in the initial state remain valid, with `sunks` incremented by 1 and `r` decremented by 1.
