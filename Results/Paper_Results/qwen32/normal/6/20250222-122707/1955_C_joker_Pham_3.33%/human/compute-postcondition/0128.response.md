Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` is 0, no changes are made to `sunks`, `r`, `k`, `a[r]`, or `l`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `sunks`, `r`, `k`, `a[r]`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial state. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In simpler terms, the values of `n`, `l`, `r`, `k`, `sunks`, and `a[r]` remain the same as in the initial state, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
