Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the Kraken's attacks are more than the total durability of the ships. The logic for determining when to stop attacking and how to handle the last attack is flawed. Here are some specific issues:

1. **Handling of the Last Attack:** The program checks for `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k` and `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k` to determine if the Kraken can sink a ship in the last attack. This is incorrect because the Kraken can sink a ship if `k >= a[l]` or `k >= a[r]` and not necessarily `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k` or `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`.

2. **Efficiency:** The program uses a while loop that can be inefficient for large `k` values. It should be optimized to handle up to `10^15` attacks efficiently.

3. **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle edge cases where the Kraken's attacks are more than the total durability of the ships correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func_1(n, k, a):
    (l, r) = (0, n - 1)
    sunks = 0
    
    while l <= r and k > 0:
        if a[l] == 0:
            l += 1
            continue
        if a[r] == 0:
            r -= 1
            continue
        
        if a[l] <= a[r]:
            if k >= a[l]:
                k -= a[l]
                sunks += 1
                a[l] = 0
                a[r] -= a[l]
                if a[r] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    r -= 1
            else:
                a[l] -= k
                k = 0
        else:
            if k >= a[r]:
                k -= a[r]
                sunks += 1
                a[r] = 0
                a[l] -= a[r]
                if a[l] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    l += 1
            else:
                a[r] -= k
                k = 0
    
    return sunks

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, k, a))
```

This corrected version ensures that the Kraken attacks are handled correctly and efficiently, even for large values of `k`.
