Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`, each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 (except `a[l]` which has been modified), the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `l` and `r` are integers, and `sunks` remains 0 if `k` was 0 initially, otherwise `sunks` retains its original value. Additionally, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]` (before the operation). The current value of `k` is `k - a[r] * 2`. The current value of `a[l]` is 0.**
