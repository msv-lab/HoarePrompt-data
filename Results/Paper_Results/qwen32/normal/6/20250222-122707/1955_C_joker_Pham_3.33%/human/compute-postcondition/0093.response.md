Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and if `k` is 0, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values. If `k` >= `a[r] * 2`, then `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, and if `a[l]` becomes 0, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1. If `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values.**
