Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` and `r` are integers, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`. Additionally, `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`.**
