Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `k` remains 0 if it was 0 initially, otherwise `k` retains its original value or is updated to `k - a[r] * 2` if `k >= a[r] * 2`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is 0 if `a[l]` was originally equal to 0, otherwise `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]` if `k >= a[r] * 2`. Each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 (except `a[l]` which may be 0), the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `l` is `l + 1` if `a[l]` was originally equal to 0 and `k >= a[r] * 2`, otherwise `l` retains its original value, `r` is an integer and is `r - 1` if `k >= a[r] * 2`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` was originally equal to 0 and `k` was 0 initially, or if `k` equals `a[r] * 2 - 1`, otherwise `sunks` retains its original value. Additionally, `a[r]` is less than the original value of `a[l]` (before the operation) if `k >= a[r] * 2`. `k` is less than `a[r] * 2` if the else part is executed.**
