The value of `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`. The values of `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged. Since `k` was initially at least twice the value of `a[r]`, after the operation, `k` will still be a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `l` and `r` are integers, and `sunks` remains 0 if `k` was 0 initially, otherwise `sunks` retains its original value. Additionally, `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`. The current value of `k` is `k - a[r] * 2`.**
