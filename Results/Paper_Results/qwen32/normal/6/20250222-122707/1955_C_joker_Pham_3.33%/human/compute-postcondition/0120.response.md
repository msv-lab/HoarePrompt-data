The code snippet provided increments the variable `sunks` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is unchanged, `sunks` is `sunks` + 1, `a[r]` is unchanged, `a[l]` is `a[l] - a[r]`.**
