Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `sunks` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    if k == 0:
        break
    if l == r:
        if k >= a[r]:
            sunks += 1
            break
        break
    if a[l] <= a[r]:
        if k >= a[l] * 2:
            k -= a[l] * 2
            a[r] -= a[l]
            if a[r] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
            continue
        elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break
    if k == 0:
        break
    if a[r] < a[l]:
        if k >= a[r] * 2:
            k -= a[r] * 2
            a[l] -= a[r]
            if a[l] == 0:
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            sunks += 1
            r -= 1
            continue
        elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:
            sunks += 1
            break
        else:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `k` remains 0 if it was 0 initially, otherwise `k` retains its original value or is updated to `k - a[r] * 2` if `k >= a[r] * 2`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is 0 if `a[l]` was originally equal to 0, otherwise `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]` if `k >= a[r] * 2`. Each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 (except `a[l]` which may be 0), the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `l` is `l + 1` if `a[l]` was originally equal to 0 and `k >= a[r] * 2`, otherwise `l` retains its original value, `r` is an integer and is `r - 1` if `k >= a[r] * 2`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` was originally equal to 0 and `k` was 0 initially, or if `k` equals `a[r] * 2 - 1`, otherwise `sunks` retains its original value. Additionally, `a[r]` is less than the original value of `a[l]` (before the operation) if `k >= a[r] * 2`. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, no changes are made to `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, or `sunks`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and if `k` is 0, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values. If `k` >= `a[r] * 2`, then `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, and if `a[l]` becomes 0, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1. If `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[r]` < `a[l]`, then: if `k` >= `a[r] * 2`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1; if `k` < `a[r] * 2`, and `k` is not 0, the values of `sunks`, `r`, `k`, `a[r]`, and `l` remain unchanged; if `k` is 0, no changes are made to `sunks`, `r`, `k`, `a[r]`, or `l`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; if `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1. In all cases, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[r]` is not less than `a[l]`, no changes are made to `sunks`, `r`, `k`, `a[r]`, or `l`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
