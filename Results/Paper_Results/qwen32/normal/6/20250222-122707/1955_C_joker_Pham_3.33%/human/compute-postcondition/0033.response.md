Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and `l` and `r` are integers. The current value of `k` is 0. The state of the variables `l`, `r`, `a`, `n`, and each `a_i` remains unchanged. The variable `sunks` remains 0. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
