Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 and `k` has been decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is an integer, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain as specified in the initial state, with `sunks` incremented by 1.
