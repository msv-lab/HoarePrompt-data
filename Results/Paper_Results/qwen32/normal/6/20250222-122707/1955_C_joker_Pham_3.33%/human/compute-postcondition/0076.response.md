Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5. If `k` >= `a[l] * 2`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[l]` is set to 0, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`, `l` is incremented by 1, and if `a[r]` becomes 0, `r` is decremented by 1. `sunks` is incremented by 1 in this case. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged if it was 0 initially, `a[l]` retains its original value, `l` and `r` retain their original values, and if `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k` or if `l` equals `r` and `k` was 0 initially and `a[l]` was originally 0, `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
