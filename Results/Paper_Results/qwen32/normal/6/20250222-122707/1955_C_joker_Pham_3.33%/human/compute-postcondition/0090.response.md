Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `n`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement because `k` is 0.
