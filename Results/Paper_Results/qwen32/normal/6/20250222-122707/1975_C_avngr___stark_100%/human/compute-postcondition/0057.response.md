Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t-1`, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3, `a` is the new list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `i` is `n-2`, `max` is the maximum value of the middle elements of all possible slices of 3 consecutive elements in the new array `a`. Since `n` is at least 3, the if condition `n == 2` is never met, so the else part is not executed.**
