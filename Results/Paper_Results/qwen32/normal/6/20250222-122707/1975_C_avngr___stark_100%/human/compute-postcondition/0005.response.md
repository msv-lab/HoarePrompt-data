To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is the input integer representing the length of the array `a` and the current value of `n` is 2.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(min(a))
```

### Analysis:
- `a` is a list of integers with a length of 2 (`n = 2`). So, `a` contains exactly two integers.
- The `min(a)` function will return the smallest integer in the list `a`.

### Example:
Let's assume the input for the list `a` is `[5, 3]`. In this case:
- `a = [5, 3]`
- `min(a)` will evaluate to `3` because 3 is the smaller of the two integers in the list.

### General Case:
Since we don't have the exact values of the integers in the list `a`, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of `a`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(min(a))` statement will output the smallest integer in the list `a`.

Output: **min(a) (where a is a list of two integers)**
