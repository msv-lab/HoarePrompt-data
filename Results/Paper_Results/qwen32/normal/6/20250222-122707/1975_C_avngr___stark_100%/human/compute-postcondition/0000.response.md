The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This assignment does not affect any other variables, and the initial state of the array `a` and its length `n` remain unchanged as they are not referenced or modified in this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` consists of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array `a`.**
