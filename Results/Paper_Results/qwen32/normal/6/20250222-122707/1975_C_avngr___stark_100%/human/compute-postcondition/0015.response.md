The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value such that the loop has not yet terminated. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that `i` was the value at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` starting at index `i + 1` and including up to the next 3 elements. If the second element of `temp` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1.**

To clearly specify the state with the adjusted `i`:
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` starting at index `i + 1` and including up to the next 3 elements. If the second element of `temp` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we express the next state in terms of `i + 1`.
