Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `a` is now the new list of `n` integers provided by the user input. If `n` is equal to 2, `max` remains unchanged as there are no slices of 3 consecutive elements in the array `a`. Otherwise, `max` is the maximum value of the middle elements of all possible slices of 3 consecutive elements in the array `a`.**
