Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t-1`, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3, `a` is the new list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `i` is `n-2`, `max` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    temp = a[i:i + 3]
    temp.sort()
    if temp[1] > max:
        max = temp[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t-1`, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input and is at least 3, `a` is the new list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `i` is 0, `max` is the second element of `temp` if the second element of `temp` is greater than the original `max`, otherwise `max` remains unchanged, and `temp` is the sorted list containing the first three elements of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t-1`, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input and is at least 3, `a` is the new list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `i` is 1, `max` is the second element of `temp` if the second element of `temp` is greater than the original `max`, otherwise `max` remains unchanged, and `temp` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `i` and including the next two elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t-1`, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user input and is at least 3, `a` is the new list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `i` is 2, and `temp` is the sorted sublist of `a` starting from index 2 and including the next two elements. If the second element of `temp` is greater than the original `max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`; otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
