The code snippet provided is just reading an integer `t` from the input. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases that will follow. The values of `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` for each test case are not yet read or processed by this snippet.

Therefore, the only change in the state is that `t` is now assigned the value of the input integer. The preconditions for the test cases remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each of the following t test cases consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. In each test case, there is at least one a_i that equals 1.**
