### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the program to see if the program correctly solves the problem.

The goal is to move chips to form a single contiguous block with the minimum number of moves. The program calculates the minimum number of operations required by counting the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1) in the list.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Read Input**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Process Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers (either 0 or 1).
   - It initializes a counter `res` to 0.
   - It removes any leading zeros from the list `a` using `a.pop(0)` until the first element is a chip (1).
   - It removes any trailing zeros from the list `a` using `a.pop()` until the last element is a chip (1).
   - It then iterates through the modified list `a` and increments the counter `res` for each free cell (0) encountered.
   - Finally, it prints the counter `res`, which represents the number of operations needed to move the chips into a single contiguous block.

### Analysis:

The program correctly identifies the free cells between the first and last chip in the list and counts them, which is indeed the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single contiguous block. Here's why this works:

- **Leading and Trailing Zeros**: By removing leading and trailing zeros, the program focuses only on the segment of the ribbon that contains chips, which simplifies the counting process.
- **Counting Free Cells**: The loop that increments `res` for each 0 in the list correctly counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, which is the number of moves required to bring all chips together.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly computes the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single contiguous block for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
