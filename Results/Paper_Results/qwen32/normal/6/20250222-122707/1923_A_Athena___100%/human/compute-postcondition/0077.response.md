The code provided removes the last element from the list `a`. Given the initial state, `a` already had its last element removed and a `0` added back to it. After executing `a.pop()`, the `0` that was added back will be removed, reverting `a` to its state before the `0` was added.

Output State: **`a` is a list with the last element removed**.
