The provided code snippet takes a line of input and converts it into a list of integers. This list is stored in the variable `a`. Given the initial state, `n` is already defined as the number of integers that will be in the input line. The value of `t` (the number of test cases) is not directly affected by this line of code, nor is `n` itself, as `n` is redefined for each test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an input integer where 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.**
