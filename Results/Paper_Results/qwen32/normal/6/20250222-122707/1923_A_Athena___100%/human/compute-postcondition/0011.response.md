Let's analyze the loop and the given states to determine the final output state.

The loop:
```python
while a and a[0] == 0:
    a.pop(0)
```

This loop continues to remove the first element of the list `a` as long as `a` is not empty and the first element is `0`. The loop stops when either `a` becomes empty or the first element is not `0`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 50
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1
- `res` is 0

The output states after the first 3 iterations provide clues about the state of `a`:
- After 1 iteration: `a` has at least one element, and `n` is reduced to 49 (since one element is removed).
- After 2 iterations: The first element of `a` is not `0` but `a` still has elements.
- After 3 iterations: The first element of `a` is not `0`, and this is the state after removing all leading `0`s.

The loop will continue to remove `0`s from the beginning of `a` until the first element is not `0` or `a` becomes empty. Therefore, the final state of `a` will be:
- `a` is either empty or the first element is not `0`.
- `n` will be the new length of `a` after removing all leading `0`s.
- `t` and `res` remain unchanged.

Hence, the final output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50 and `n` is the new length of `a` after removing all leading `0`s; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, and if `a` is not empty, the first element is not 0; `res` is 0.**

In simple terms, the final state means `t` and `res` remain the same, `a` will have no leading zeros, and `n` will reflect the new length of `a`.
