The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` is either 0, 1, or 2. Therefore, after incrementing, `c` can be 1, 2, or 3. The values of `l`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is `l[x]`, `b` is either `l[x]`, `l[x-2]`, or `float('inf')`, `c` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `n` is greater than 0.**
