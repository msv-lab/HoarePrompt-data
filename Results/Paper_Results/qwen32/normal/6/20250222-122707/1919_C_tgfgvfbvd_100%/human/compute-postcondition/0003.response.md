The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to both `a` and `b`. This means both `a` and `b` are set to positive infinity. The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is positive infinity; `b` is positive infinity.**
