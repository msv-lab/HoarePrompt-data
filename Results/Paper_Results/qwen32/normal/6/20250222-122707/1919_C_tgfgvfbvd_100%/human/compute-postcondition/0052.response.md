Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `l[x]`, and `c` is 0. Additionally, `l[x]` is greater than `a`. The current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`.**

In simple terms, the value of `b` has been updated to be equal to `l[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
