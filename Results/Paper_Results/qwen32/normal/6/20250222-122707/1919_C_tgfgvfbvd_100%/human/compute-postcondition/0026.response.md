Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is incremented by 1. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `l[x]` and if the new `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped. Additionally, if the new `a` is greater than `b`, `c` is incremented by 1.**
