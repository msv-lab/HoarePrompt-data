Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, and `l[x]` is greater than `a`. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains `float('inf')` and `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `l[x]`, `b` is set to `float('inf')`, and `c` is updated to 1.**
