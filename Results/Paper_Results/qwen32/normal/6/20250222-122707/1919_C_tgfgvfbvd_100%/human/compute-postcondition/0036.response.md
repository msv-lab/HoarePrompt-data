Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is incremented by 1. If `l[x]` was less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is `l[x-1]`. If `l[x]` was greater than `a`, then `b` is assigned the value of `l[x]` if it was less than or equal to `b`, or `a` is assigned the value of `l[x]` and `c` is incremented by 1 if `l[x]` was greater than `b`. If `a` is greater than `b` at any point, then `a` and `b` have their values swapped.**
