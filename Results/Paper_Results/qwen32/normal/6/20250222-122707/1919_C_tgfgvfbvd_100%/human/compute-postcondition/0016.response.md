The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Given the initial state, `c` was 0, so after the increment, `c` becomes 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `l[x]`; `b` is positive infinity; `c` is 1.**
