The code snippet adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given that `q` is `b` and `b` is part of the set `ans`, the specific value of `(q - r) % n` will be added to `temp`. Since `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in `x`, and also `(q + r) % n`, adding `(q - r) % n` again does not change the set because sets do not allow duplicate elements.

Therefore, the updated state of `temp` will still be a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in `x`, plus the element `(q + r) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and is greater than 1, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and contains at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in `x`, plus the element `(q + r) % n`, `ans` is `{b, c}`, and `q` is `b`.**
