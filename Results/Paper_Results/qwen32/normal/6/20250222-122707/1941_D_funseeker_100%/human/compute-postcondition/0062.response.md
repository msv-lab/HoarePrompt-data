The code adds the element `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given the initial state, if `c` was '0', `temp` was an empty set. If `c` was '1', `temp` already contained the element `(q - r) % n`. If `c` was '?', `temp` contained the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. After the code execution, `temp` will definitely contain the element `(q - r) % n`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `r` is still the integer value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `q` is still the next element in `ans`.

Output State: **`temp` contains the element `(q - r) % n`; `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `r` is an integer value returned by `func_1().split()`, `q` is the next element in `ans`.**
