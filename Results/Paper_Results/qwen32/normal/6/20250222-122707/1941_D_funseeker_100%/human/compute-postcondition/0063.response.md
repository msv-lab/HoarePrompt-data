Postcondition: **`temp` is a set. If `c` is '0', `temp` remains an empty set. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the element `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '?', `temp` also contains the element `(q + r) % n`. `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged. `r` is an integer value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `q` is the next element in `ans`.**
