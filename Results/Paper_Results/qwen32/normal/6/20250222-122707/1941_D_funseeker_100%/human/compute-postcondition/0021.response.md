The code modifies the `temp` set by adding a new element calculated as `(q - r) % n`. None of the other variables are explicitly modified, so their states remain as described in the initial state. The only change is the addition of a new element to the `temp` set.

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and must be an iterable with at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and can be either '0' or '?', `ans` is `x` with at least one element remaining, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` includes the new element `(q - r) % n`.**
