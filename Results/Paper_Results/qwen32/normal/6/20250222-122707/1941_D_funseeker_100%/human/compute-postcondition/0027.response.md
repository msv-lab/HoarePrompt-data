The code snippet provided is `r = int(r)`. This line converts the variable `r` to an integer. Given that `r` is already described as the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, the conversion does not change its value. Therefore, `r` remains the same integer value it was before the conversion.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `c`, and `ans`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `x` if `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is '0', `ans` is an empty set.**
