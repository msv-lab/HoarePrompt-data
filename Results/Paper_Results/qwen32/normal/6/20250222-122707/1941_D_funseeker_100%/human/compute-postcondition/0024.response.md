Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `x` if `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is '0', `ans` is an empty set.**

In natural language: The variable `ans` is now set to the value of `temp`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `ans` contains unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `x`. If `c` is '0', `ans` is an empty set. All other variables retain their initial values.
