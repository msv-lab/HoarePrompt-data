The only object in the loop head is the variable `q` and the iterable `ans`. For the loop to execute, `ans` must be an iterable (like a list, set, tuple, etc.) that contains at least one element. Since `ans` is set to `x`, `x` must be an iterable with at least one element.

Given the provided state, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `x` must be an iterable with at least one element.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and must be an iterable with at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `ans` is `x`, `temp` is an empty set**
