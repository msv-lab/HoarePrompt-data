The given code snippet updates the values of `r` and `c` by splitting the return value of `func_1()` into two parts. 

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `x` if `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is '0', `ans` is an empty set.**

In simpler terms: The variables `r` and `c` are updated to be the integer value and the string value of the two parts returned by `func_1().split()`, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
