To determine the output of the given `print(*sorted(ans))` statement, we need to analyze the state of the `ans` set based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`ans` Set**: This set contains all unique values computed from the expressions `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the `ans` set from the previous iteration, based on the `c` values from each iteration.
2. **Exclusion and Adjustment**: If `0` was in the `ans` set, it is excluded, and `n` is added to the set. If `0` was not in the `ans` set, the set remains unchanged.
3. **Variables**:
   - `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` remain unchanged.
   - `c` is the value from the last iteration of `func_1().split()`.

### Analysis:
- The `ans` set is dynamically updated based on the previous state of `ans` and the value of `c` (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state but is assumed to be provided by the function `func_1().split()`).
- The values in `ans` are derived from the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
- The set is sorted and then printed.

### Output Description:
Given the provided information, the exact numerical values in the `ans` set cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n`, `r`, and the sequence of `c` values generated by `func_1().split()`. However, we can describe the output format and the logic used to generate it.

The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will output the sorted values of the `ans` set, which contains unique results from the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the `ans` set, with the condition that if `0` was in the set, it is excluded, and `n` is added.

### Final Output:
Output: **sorted unique values of the `ans` set, where `ans` is computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the `ans` set, and if `0` was in the set, it is excluded, and `n` is added**.
