The code adds the value of `n` to the set `ans`. Since `n` is a specific value and `ans` is a set of unique values, the set `ans` will now include `n` if it was not already present. The values of `m`, `x`, and `r` remain unchanged, and `c` retains the value from the last iteration of `func_1().split()`.

Output State: **`ans` is a set of all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the previous `ans` set, based on the `c` values from each iteration, excluding `0`, and now includes `n`; `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` remain unchanged; `c` is the value from the last iteration of `func_1().split()`.**
