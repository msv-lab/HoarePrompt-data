The code snippet `n, m, x = func_3()` indicates that the function `func_3()` returns three values which are then assigned to `n`, `m`, and `x` respectively. The initial state of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` is provided. After the function call, the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` will be updated based on the return values of `func_3()`. The values of `r` and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()`, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()`, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= n - 1, and `c` is a character that can be '0', '1', or '?'**.
