Postcondition: **`ans` is a set of all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the previous `ans` set, based on the `c` values from each iteration; `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` remain unchanged; `c` is the value from the last iteration of `func_1().split()`. The current value of `ans` includes 0.**
