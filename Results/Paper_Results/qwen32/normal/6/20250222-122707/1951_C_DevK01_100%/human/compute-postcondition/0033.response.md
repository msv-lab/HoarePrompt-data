The code snippet `cost = mu * w` updates the value of `cost` based on the values of `mu` and `w`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `mu` is defined as `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `w` is the last element of `N`.

The new value of `cost` is calculated as `mu * w`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0; `n` is the length of `N` minus 1; `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`; `k` is the third element of `L`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`; `N` is the first `q - 1` elements of `M`; `w` is the last element that was in `N`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w`.**
