Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of `N`; `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `L[1]` and `k`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `L` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`; `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

The variable `cost` is updated to be `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. All other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
