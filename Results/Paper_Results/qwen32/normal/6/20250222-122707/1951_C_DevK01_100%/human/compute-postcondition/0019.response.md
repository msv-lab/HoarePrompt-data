To determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the calculations involved in determining the `cost` variable.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input and Initial Values:**
   - `t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `k` is the third element of `L`.
   - `m` is initially the minimum of the original `m` and `k`.
   - `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`.

2. **Determine `n` and `N`:**
   - If `n * m` equals `k`, then `n` is `q` and `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - Otherwise, `n` is the length of the list `N` after potentially removing the last element, and `N` contains the first `q-1` elements of `M` after removing the last element.

3. **Calculate `cost`:**
   - If `n * m` equals `k`, then `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `cost` is updated to `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.

### Description of the Output:
The `cost` is calculated based on the conditions and values derived from the input lists `L` and `M`. The exact numerical value of `cost` depends on the specific values of `L`, `M`, `k`, `m`, `q`, `n`, and `N`.

Since the exact input lists `L` and `M` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cost`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `cost`.

### Final Output:
Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the input lists L and M, and the derived values of k, m, q, n, and N)**
