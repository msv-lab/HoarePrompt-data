The code `w = N.pop()` removes the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to the variable `w`. Given the initial state, `N` contains the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`. After the `pop` operation, `N` will have one less element, and `w` will hold the value of the element that was removed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is `q`; `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`; `k` is the third element of `L`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`; `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M` after removing the last element; `w` is the last element of the original `N`.**
