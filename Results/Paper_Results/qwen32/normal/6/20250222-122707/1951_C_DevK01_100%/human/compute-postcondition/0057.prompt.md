Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer; `n` is either 3 Â· 10^5 or less, `m` is between 1 and 10^9, `k` is between 1 and min(nm, 10^9); `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is `q` if `n * m` equals `k`, otherwise `n` is the length of the list `N` after potentially removing the last element; `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`; `k` is the third element of `L`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`; `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m` equals `k`, otherwise `N` contains the first `q-1` elements of `M` after removing the last element; `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m` equals `k`, otherwise `cost` is updated to `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0; `n` is the length of `N`; `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`; `k` is the third element of `L`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` and `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `n` is `q - 1`, `N` is the first `q - 1` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element that was in `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of `N`; `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `L[1]` and `k`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `L` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`; `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N` is the first `q - 1` elements of `M`; `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is `(k - (n - 1) * m) * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * (k - (n - 1) * m)` where `w` is the last element that was in `N` when `n * m != k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
