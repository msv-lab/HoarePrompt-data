The given code snippet modifies the `cost` variable by adding a calculated expression to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are part of the expression that modifies `cost`.

Let's break down the expression:
- `m * sum(N)`: This is `m` multiplied by the sum of the first `q - 1` elements of the sorted list `M`.
- `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`: This is `m` squared multiplied by the sum of the first `n - 1` integers, which is equivalent to `m * m * (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
- `n * m * mu`: This is `n` multiplied by `m` and then by `mu`.

The new value of `cost` is the original `cost` plus the sum of these three expressions.

Given the initial state, the updated `cost` can be expressed as:
- `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0; `n` is `q - 1`; `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`; `k` is the third element of `L`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`; `N` is the first `q - 1` elements of `M`; `w` is the last element that was in `N`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
