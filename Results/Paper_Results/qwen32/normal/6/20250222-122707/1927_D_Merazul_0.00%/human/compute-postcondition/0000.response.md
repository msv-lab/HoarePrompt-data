The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer. This lambda function does not directly modify any existing variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, `r`), but it sets up a mechanism for reading input in the subsequent code.

Given that no further operations are specified in the provided code snippet, the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the introduction of the lambda function `R`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` < `r` ≤ `n`; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**
