The code `v = i in b` checks if the value of `i` is present in the list `b` and assigns the result (a boolean value) to the variable `v`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `u` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains the same, `u` is `True` if `i + 1` is in `a`, otherwise `u` is `False`, `v` is `True` if `i` is in `b`, otherwise `v` is `False`.**
