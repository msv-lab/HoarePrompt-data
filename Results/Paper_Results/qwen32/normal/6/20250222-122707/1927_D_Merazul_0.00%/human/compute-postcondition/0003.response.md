Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` < `r` ≤ `n`; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer.**

In simpler terms, the value of `t` has been decreased by 1, but it is still greater than 0. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `R`) remain unchanged.
