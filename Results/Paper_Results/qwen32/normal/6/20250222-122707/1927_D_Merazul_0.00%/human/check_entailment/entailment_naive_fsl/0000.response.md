Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to be addressing the problem description correctly. The program appears to be attempting to solve a different problem, possibly related to set operations and intersections, rather than finding pairs of different elements within specified ranges of an array.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect based on the given problem description:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The task is to find two different indices `i` and `j` within a given range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] != a[j]`. If no such pair exists, the program should output `-1 -1`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads input values but does not process them correctly to find the required pairs.
   - The program uses set operations (`a = {*R()}` and `b = {*R()}`) which do not align with the problem requirements.
   - The logic involving `f`, `m`, and `n` does not seem to correspond to solving the problem of finding different elements within a specified range.
   - The final print statement uses a string slicing approach to output 'YES' or 'NO', which is not aligned with the problem's output requirements of printing indices or `-1 -1`.

3. **Example Case**: Let's consider the first test case from the problem description:
   ```
   5
   1 1 2 1 1
   3
   1 5
   1 2
   1 3
   ```
   - For the query `1 5`, the program should output `2 3` because `a[2] != a[3]` (1 != 2).
   - For the query `1 2`, the program should output `-1 -1` because all elements in the range are the same (1).
   - For the query `1 3`, the program should output `2 3` because `a[2] != a[3]` (1 != 2).

   The provided program does not handle these cases correctly, as it does not even attempt to find indices within the specified ranges.

Given these points, the program is clearly not solving the problem as described, and thus the correctness is **False**.
