The code snippet `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any, `count` is the final count after all iterations, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `num % x` in `arr`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `num % y` in `arr`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the last tuple in `test_cases`.**
