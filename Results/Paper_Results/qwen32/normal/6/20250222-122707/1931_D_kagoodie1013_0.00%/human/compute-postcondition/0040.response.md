The code snippet updates the value of `mod_y_key` to be `num % y`. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their specific values or conditions. 

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`.**
