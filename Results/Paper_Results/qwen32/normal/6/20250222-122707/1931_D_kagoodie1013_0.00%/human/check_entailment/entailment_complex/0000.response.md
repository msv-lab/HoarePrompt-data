### Reasoning:

The program is designed to find the number of "beautiful pairs" in an array for multiple test cases. A pair \((i, j)\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The key part of the program is the logic to count these pairs efficiently. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Modulo Calculations**:
   - For each element in the array, calculate two values:
     - `mod_x = -num % x`: This is the negative of the number modulo \(x\).
     - `mod_y = num % y`: This is the number modulo \(y\).

2. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - Use dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to keep track of the counts of each modulo value encountered so far.
   - For each number in the array, count how many previous numbers have a `mod_x` value that matches the current number's `mod_x` (negated) and a `mod_y` value that matches the current number's `mod_y`.
   - Update the dictionaries with the current number's modulo values.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The approach ensures that each element is processed in constant time on average, leading to an overall time complexity of \(O(n)\) per test case. This is critical given the constraints (up to \(2 \times 10^5\) elements across all test cases).

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Initialization**: The program initializes the necessary data structures (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) for each test case.
- **Modulo Calculation**: The modulo calculations (`mod_x = -num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`) are correct and align with the conditions for a beautiful pair.
- **Counting Logic**: The logic to count the number of beautiful pairs by checking the dictionaries is correct.
- **Dictionary Updates**: The dictionaries are updated correctly to reflect the current state of the array as it is processed.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. Given the constraints and the logic used, the program is efficient and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
