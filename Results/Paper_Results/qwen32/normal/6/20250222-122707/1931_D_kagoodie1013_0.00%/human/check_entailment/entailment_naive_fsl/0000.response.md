Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program contains a logical error in the calculation of the `mod_x` value. Specifically, the line `mod_x = -num % x` is incorrect. The intention seems to be to find the modular inverse or some form of complement that would help in checking the condition `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`. However, `-num % x` is not the correct way to achieve this.

The correct way to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` is to ensure that `(a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0`. Similarly, for the second condition `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`, we need `(a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0`.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_xy_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            mod_xy = (mod_x, mod_y)
            count += mod_xy_map.get(mod_xy, 0)
            mod_xy_map[mod_xy] = mod_xy_map.get(mod_xy, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This corrected version uses a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` to count pairs that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. The original program's logic for counting pairs is flawed, and thus the program is incorrect.
