To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head for the given for loop is:

```python
for num in arr:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `arr` contains at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one integer.

From the provided state before the loop starts, `arr` is updated to the list `a` from the next tuple in `test_cases`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the first tuple in `test_cases` must contain a list `a` with at least one integer.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a; the first tuple in `test_cases` must have a list `a` with at least one integer; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
