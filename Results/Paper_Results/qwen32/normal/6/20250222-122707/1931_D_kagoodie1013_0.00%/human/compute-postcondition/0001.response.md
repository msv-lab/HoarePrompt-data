The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and the iterable `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least one tuple, the loop will execute. 

To ensure the loop executes, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple, and the tuple must contain valid values for `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` as specified in the problem statement. The variable `results` being an empty list does not affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `test_cases` contains at least one valid tuple.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a; `test_cases` must contain at least one valid tuple; `results` is an empty list**
