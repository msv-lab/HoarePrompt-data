Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the final values of `count` for each tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the final count after all iterations for the last tuple in `test_cases`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys as `mod_x_key` values from `arr` and values as their respective counts for the last tuple in `test_cases`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys as `mod_y_key` values from `arr` and values as their respective counts for the last tuple in `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the last tuple in `test_cases`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `results` will contain a list of counts, where each count corresponds to the number of valid pairs for each tuple in `test_cases`. The variables `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will reflect the frequency of modulo values for the last tuple in `test_cases`. The other variables like `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will hold the values from the last tuple processed.
