The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the current element in `arr`, and `arr` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any; `count` is 2; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 2; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 2; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases` where `arr` must have at least two elements; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`; `num` is the next element in `arr`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.**
