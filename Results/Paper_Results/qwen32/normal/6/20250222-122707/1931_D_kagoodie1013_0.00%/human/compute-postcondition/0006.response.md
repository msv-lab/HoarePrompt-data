The provided code snippet is:
```python
mod_x = -num % x
```

However, the initial state does not include a variable named `num`. Given the context, it seems that `num` should be one of the integers from the tuple (n, x, y, a) within `test_cases`. To proceed, we'll assume that `num` is intended to be one of the integers from the current tuple being processed in `test_cases`. Since the exact value of `num` is not specified, we'll use the general form of the calculation.

Let's assume `num` is one of the integers from the tuple. The calculation `-num % x` computes the negative of `num` modulo `x`. This value will be assigned to `mod_x`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `mod_x`, which will hold the value of `-num % x`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a; `test_cases` must contain at least one valid tuple; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` is a list that must contain at least one element; `mod_x` is `-num % x`.**
