The code snippet `mod_y = num % y` calculates the modulus of `num` with `y` and assigns the result to `mod_y`. The other variables (`num`, `x`, `mod_x`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`num` is the next element in `arr`; `x` is unchanged; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`.**
