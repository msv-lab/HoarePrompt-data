The code snippet calculates `mod_y` as the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `mod_y`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a, such that 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in a; `test_cases` must contain at least one valid tuple; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1`; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to `mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1`; `arr` is a list that must contain at least one element; `num` is the next element in `arr`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`.**
