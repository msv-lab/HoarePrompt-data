#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max` takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` such that 0 <= `bit` < 30. It recursively calculates and returns the maximum value between the length of `cur_arr` and the length of a new list `new_arr` formed based on the XOR operation and the specified bit. If the `bit`-th bit of the final XOR value is set, it returns the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`.
