The code snippet appends the current value of `xor` to the list `new_arr`. The values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `thing1`, and the condition regarding the `bit`-th bit of `xor` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor`, `xor` is `xor` ^ `i`, `thing1` is 0, and the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0.**
