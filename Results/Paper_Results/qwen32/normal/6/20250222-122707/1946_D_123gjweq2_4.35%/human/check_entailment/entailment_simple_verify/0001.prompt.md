You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of contiguous subarrays (segments) such that:
1. The segments are non-overlapping and cover the entire array.
2. The bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of each segment is less than or equal to a given number `x`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program uses a recursive approach with a helper function `find_max` to solve the problem. The idea is to try to split the array into segments such that the bitwise OR of their XORs is less than or equal to `x`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calls `find_max` with the initial array and the highest bit position (31, since `x` is less than `2^30`).

2. **Function `find_max`**:
   - This function is recursive and processes the array `cur_arr` for a specific bit position `bit`.
   - If `bit` is `-1`, it means all bits have been processed, and the function returns the length of the array, indicating that the array can be split into that many segments.
   - It iterates through the array, maintaining a running XOR (`xor`) of the elements.
   - When the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is `0`, it means the current segment can be split here, and the XOR of the segment is added to `new_arr`.
   - After the loop, if the `bit`-th bit of the final `xor` is `1`, it means the last segment cannot be split further, and `thing1` is set to `-1`.
   - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is `1`, it means we can try to split the array further, and the function returns the maximum of two possibilities: either the result of `find_max` with the next lower bit or the length of `new_arr`.
   - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is `0`, it means we cannot split the array further, and the function returns `thing1`.

### Issues in the Program

The program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Base Case**:
   - The base case in `find_max` when `bit` is `-1` is incorrect. It should check if the bitwise OR of the XORs of the segments is less than or equal to `x`, not just return the length of the array.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Segments**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the segments cannot be split further. It should return `-1` if no valid segmentation is possible.

3. **Incorrect Bitwise Operations**:
   - The program uses `xor >> bit & 1` to check the `bit`-th bit of `xor`. This is correct, but the logic for handling the segments is flawed.

4. **Incorrect Recursive Calls**:
   - The recursive calls to `find_max` are not correctly structured to ensure that the segments are valid and cover the entire array.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
