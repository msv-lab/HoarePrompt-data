Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `i` is the second element of `cur_arr`, `thing1` is 0. If `xor` >> `bit` & 1` is 0, then `xor` is set to 0 and `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it. Otherwise, `xor` remains `i`.**
