Let's analyze the given code snippet and determine the output state based on the initial state provided.

Initial State:
- `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements.
- `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, and `bit` is not equal to -1.
- `i` is the third element of `cur_arr`.
- `thing1` is 0.
- `xor` is updated to `xor ^ i`.
- If `xor >> bit & 1` is 0, then `xor` is set to 0 and `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it. Otherwise, `xor` remains `i`.
- `new_arr.append(xor)`

The code snippet modifies `xor` based on the condition `xor >> bit & 1` and then appends the final value of `xor` to `new_arr`.

Let's break down the steps:
1. `xor` is initially updated to `xor ^ i`.
2. The condition `xor >> bit & 1` is checked.
   - If the condition is 0, `xor` is set to 0.
   - If the condition is not 0, `xor` remains `i`.
3. The final value of `xor` is appended to `new_arr`.

Given these steps, the output state will depend on the value of `xor >> bit & 1` after the initial update of `xor`.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements; `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, and `bit` is not equal to -1; `i` is the third element of `cur_arr`; `thing1` is 0; `xor` is 0 if `xor >> bit & 1` is 0, otherwise `xor` is `i`; `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it.**

In simpler terms:
- `cur_arr`, `bit`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- `thing1` remains 0.
- `xor` is either 0 or `i` based on the condition `xor >> bit & 1`.
- `new_arr` has the final value of `xor` appended to it.
