The code snippet reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies that `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. After executing the code, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated based on the user input, but the values of `t`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `q` is greater than 0; `i` is 2**.

In simpler terms, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, while `t`, `q`, and `i` retain their initial values.
