Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `q` is greater than 3; `i` is 3. The condition `a < b > c` is evaluated, but the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition is true or false.**
