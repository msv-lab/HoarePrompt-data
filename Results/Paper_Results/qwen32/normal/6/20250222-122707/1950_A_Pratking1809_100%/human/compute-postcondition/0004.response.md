The `print` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `q`. It simply prints the string `'STAIR'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`), but the `print` statement does not use any of these variables.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'STAIR'`.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'STAIR'`.

Output: **STAIR**
