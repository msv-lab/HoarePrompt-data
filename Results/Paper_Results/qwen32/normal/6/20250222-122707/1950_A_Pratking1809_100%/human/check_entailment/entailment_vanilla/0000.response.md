Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, which is within the specified range (1 to 1000).
2. For each test case, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. These digits are guaranteed to be within the range 0 to 9.
3. The program then checks the conditions:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR", which correctly identifies the digits as forming a stair.
   - If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK", which correctly identifies the digits as forming a peak.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE", which correctly identifies the digits as forming neither a stair nor a peak.
4. The program handles all possible combinations of the three digits and outputs the correct result for each combination.

The logic in the program matches the problem description and handles all valid inputs as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
