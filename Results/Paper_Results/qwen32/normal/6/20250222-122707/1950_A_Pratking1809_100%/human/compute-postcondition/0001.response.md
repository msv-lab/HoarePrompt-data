The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range is determined by `q`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `q` to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `q` is at least 1. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `q` must be greater than 0**
