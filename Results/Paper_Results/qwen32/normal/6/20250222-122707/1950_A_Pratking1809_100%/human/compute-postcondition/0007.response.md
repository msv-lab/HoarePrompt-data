The initial state describes several integer variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`) and their constraints. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on the values of these variables. It simply prints the string `'PEAK'`.

Let's break down the information provided:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- It is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c` (which means `b` is not a peak in the sequence `a`, `b`, `c`).
- `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

Despite these conditions, none of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `q` are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement only outputs the string `'PEAK'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **PEAK**
