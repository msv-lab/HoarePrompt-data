To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `N` is the input integer representing `t`.
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `nums` is a list of differences between consecutive elements starting from the original first element.
- `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list.
- `nw` is `False` if `nums[1]` is 1, otherwise `nw` is `True`.
- `cw` is `False` if `nums[1]` is 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`.
- The current value of `cw` is `True`, which means `nums[1]` is not 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Explanation:
The print statement `print('Alice')` directly outputs the string `'Alice'` without any dependency on the variables `t`, `N`, `n`, `nums`, `ls`, `nw`, or `cw`. The value of `cw` being `True` does not influence the output of this specific print statement.

### Conclusion:
Since the print statement is straightforward and does not reference any variables, the output will simply be the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
