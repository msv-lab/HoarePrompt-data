The code snippet provided is:
```
nums[i] -= ls
```

This means that the element at index `i` in the list `nums` will be decreased by the value of `ls`.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `N` is the input integer representing `t`
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5
- `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input string with the addition of the string `'0'` and must have at least one element
- `i` is `i + 1`

After running the code, the value of `nums[i]` will be updated to `nums[i] - ls`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input string with the addition of the string `'0'` and must have at least one element where `nums[i]` is decreased by `ls`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
