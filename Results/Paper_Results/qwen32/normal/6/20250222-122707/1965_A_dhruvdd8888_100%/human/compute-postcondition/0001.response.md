The code snippet `nums = set(input().split())` takes an input string, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and then converts this list into a set. This means that `nums` will contain unique elements from the input string, and the order of elements is not preserved.

Given the initial state, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, but `N` is not used in the provided code snippet. The list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is expected to be provided as a space-separated string in the input.

After executing the code, the variable `nums` will hold a set of unique integers derived from the input string. The values of `t`, `N`, `n`, and the original list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged unless they are modified elsewhere in the code, which is not the case here.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `nums` is a set of unique integers derived from the input string.**
