The code snippet provided sets the variable `cw` to `True`. This change affects the value of `cw` only, and no other variables are impacted by this single line of code. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `n`, `nums`, `ls`, `nw`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a list of differences between consecutive elements starting from the original first element with at least 2 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list, `nw` is `False` if the current element `nums[i]` is equal to 1, otherwise `nw` is `True`, `cw` is `True`, `i` is `i - 1`**.
