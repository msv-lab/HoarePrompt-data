The code snippet `ls += nums[i]` increments the variable `ls` by the value of `nums[i]`. Given that `ls` is initially `0` and `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers with at least one element being `0`, the value of `ls` after the execution of the code will be equal to `nums[i]`.

Since `i` is `i + 1`, we need to consider the value of `nums[i]` before the increment. However, the initial state does not provide the specific value of `i`, so we can only express the new value of `ls` in terms of `nums[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input string with the addition of the string `'0'` and must have at least one element where the element at index `i` is now `0`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ls` is `nums[i]`.**
