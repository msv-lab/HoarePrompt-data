Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns an output for each test case. Specifically, if `t` is between 1 and 10,000, `n` is between 1 and 200,000 for each test case, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 1,000,000,000. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000. The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided integers.**
