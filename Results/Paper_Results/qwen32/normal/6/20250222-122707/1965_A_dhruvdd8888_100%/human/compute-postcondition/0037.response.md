Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a list of differences between consecutive elements starting from the original first element, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list, `nw` is `False` if `nums[1]` is 1, otherwise `nw` is `True`, and `cw` is `False` if `nums[1]` is 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`. Additionally, `cw` is `False`**
