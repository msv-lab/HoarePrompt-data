The code snippet `nums[i] -= ls` modifies the element at index `i` in the list `nums` by subtracting the value of `ls`. Given that `ls` is defined as `nums[i]`, this operation effectively sets `nums[i]` to `0`.

Let's break down the impact:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `N` remains the input integer representing `t`.
- `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input string with the addition of the string `'0'` and must have at least one element. The element at index `i` will now be `0`.
- `i` remains `i + 1` (though it's not clear if `i` was already incremented elsewhere in the code, this step does not change `i`).
- `ls` remains `nums[i]` before the operation, but since `nums[i]` is now `0`, `ls` would also be `0` if accessed after this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input string with the addition of the string `'0'` and must have at least one element where the element at index `i` is now `0`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ls` is `0`.**
