Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input string with the addition of the string `'0'`. `ls` is 0.**

In natural language: The variable `ls` has been assigned the value 0. All other variables (`t`, `N`, `n`, and `nums`) retain their initial values and conditions.
