Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a; `num2` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, such that `num2` == len(a); `order` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than or equal to the next element in the list, and `order` is greater than 0.**
