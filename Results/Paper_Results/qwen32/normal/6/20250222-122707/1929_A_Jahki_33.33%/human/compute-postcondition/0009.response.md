The variable `order` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`a`, `num2`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a; `num2` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, such that `num2` > 1; `i` is `num2 - 1`; `order` is increased by 1.**
