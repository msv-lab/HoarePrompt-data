Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to maximize the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when the array is rearranged. The beauty is calculated as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]
where \( a \) is a rearranged version of the input array.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read first.
   - For each test case, the length of the array \( n \) and the array elements are read.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array is strictly increasing.
   - It returns `True` if the array is strictly increasing, otherwise `False`.
   - The function summary is accurate.

3. **Logic for Calculating Beauty:**
   - The program first checks if the array is strictly increasing using `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints `0`, which is incorrect because the beauty can be non-zero even if the array is strictly increasing.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it sorts the array in non-decreasing order and calculates the beauty based on this sorted array.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Handling of Strictly Increasing Arrays:**
   - The program prints `0` if the array is strictly increasing, which is incorrect because the beauty can be calculated even for strictly increasing arrays.

2. **Incorrect Sorting Order:**
   - The program sorts the array in non-decreasing order, which does not maximize the beauty.
   - To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in non-increasing order.

### Counterexample
Let's consider the provided counterexample:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  3
  1 3 2
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  4
  ```
  This is achieved by sorting the array in non-increasing order: `[3, 2, 1]`.
- **Actual Output of the Program:**
  ```
  2
  ```
  The program sorts the array in non-decreasing order: `[1, 2, 3]`.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The program contains logical errors in both the handling of strictly increasing arrays and the sorting order to maximize the beauty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
