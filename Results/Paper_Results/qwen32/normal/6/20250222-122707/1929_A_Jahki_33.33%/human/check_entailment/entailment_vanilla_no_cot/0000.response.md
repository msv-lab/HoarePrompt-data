Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function and the way it is used. The function `func_1` checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order and returns `True` if it is, which would lead to the program printing `0` for such cases. However, the problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array, which can be achieved by sorting the array in non-decreasing order and then calculating the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

The `func_1` function is unnecessary for solving this problem. Instead, the program should directly sort the array and compute the beauty as described in the problem statement. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for _ in range(num):
    num2 = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = sum(b[i] - b[i - 1] for i in range(1, num2))
    print(beauty)
```

This corrected program will correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.
