Postcondition: **`tc` is `x + 2`, `N` is an integer greater than `x + 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, `i` is `N-1`. The count of the element at index `i` in `a` is either 0 or the current value of `t` is greater than or equal to 2.**
