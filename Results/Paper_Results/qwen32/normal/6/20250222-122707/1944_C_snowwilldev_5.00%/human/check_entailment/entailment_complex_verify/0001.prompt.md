You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: `tc` is equal to the total number of test cases `t`, `N` is the length of the list for the last test case, `a` is the list of integers for the last test case, `cnt` is a defaultdict with counts of elements in `a` for the last test case, `t` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is either the index where the loop broke or `N-1` if the loop did not break early.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`, where each element `a_i` is between 0 and `n-1`. It then determines and prints the smallest index `i` such that either the count of `i` in the list `a` is 1 or the count of `i` is 0, or if there are at least two unique elements with a count of 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a`.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of the final array `c`.
- Bob wants to minimize it.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to attempt to find the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game, given the optimal play from Alice and Bob. Let’s break down the logic:

1. **Counting Elements**: The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
2. **Calculating `t`**: It initializes `t` to 0 and iterates over the range `[0, N)`. For each index `i`, if `cnt[i] == 1`, it increments `t`.
3. **Checking Conditions**: If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, it prints the current index `i` and breaks out of the loop.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Optimal Play**: The program does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly calculates a potential MEX based on the counts of elements.
- **MEX Calculation**: The program is attempting to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` such that either:
  - `cnt[i] == 0` (meaning `i` is not present in `a` at all).
  - `t >= 2` (meaning there are at least two unique elements that appear exactly once in `a`).

### Issues:
- **Ignoring Turn Order**: The program does not consider the order in which Alice and Bob pick elements. Alice’s strategy to maximize MEX and Bob’s strategy to minimize it are not modeled.
- **Incorrect MEX Logic**: The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The program does not account for the fact that the final MEX depends on the sequence of choices made by both players.

### Example Analysis:
- For the first test case `a = [0, 0, 1, 1]`:
  - The program will find that `cnt[0] = 2`, `cnt[1] = 2`, and `cnt[2] = 0`.
  - It will print `2` because `cnt[2] == 0`.
  - This is correct, but the logic is not robust enough to handle all cases.

- For the second test case `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]`:
  - The program will find that `cnt[0] = 1`, `cnt[1] = 1`, `cnt[2] = 1`, `cnt[3] = 1`.
  - It will print `1` because `t` becomes 2 when it reaches `cnt[1]`.
  - This is correct, but again, the logic is not based on the actual game play.

- For the third test case `a = [1, 1]`:
  - The program will find that `cnt[0] = 0`.
  - It will print `0` immediately.
  - This is correct, but the logic is not based on the actual game play.

### Conclusion:
While the program seems to produce correct results for the provided examples, it does not simulate the game play and relies on a flawed logic to determine the MEX. Therefore, it may not work correctly for all possible inputs.
