Postcondition: **`tc` is `x + 1`, `N` is greater than `x + 3`, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, `i` is `x + 3`. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged and no further action is taken.**
