Postcondition: **`tc` is `x + 1`, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. `i` is `x + 2`.**
