To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and the output states after the first three iterations.

The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `N-1`. For each iteration `i`, it checks if `cnt[i]` is `1`, and if so, increments `t` by `1`. If `t` becomes `2` or if `cnt[i]` is `0`, the loop breaks, and `i` is printed.

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After the 1st iteration: `t` is either `0` or `1`, and if `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the loop breaks.
- After the 2nd iteration: `t` is either `0` or `1` (specifically, `t` is `1` if it was initially `0`, and `t` is `0` if it was initially `1`), and if `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the loop breaks.
- After the 3rd iteration: `t` remains `0` or `1` based on the value of `cnt[i]`, and if `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the loop breaks.

The loop will continue until either `t` reaches `2` or `cnt[i]` becomes `0`. 

Let's summarize the possible scenarios:
1. If `cnt[i]` is `1` for two different `i` values, `t` will reach `2`, and the loop will break at that point.
2. If `cnt[i]` becomes `0` for any `i`, the loop will break at that point and print `i`.

Given the nature of the problem, the loop will stop as soon as either of the two conditions is met. Therefore, the final state of the loop will depend on when `t` reaches `2` or when `cnt[i]` becomes `0`.

### Final Output State
The final output state will be determined by the point at which the loop breaks. This can be either when `t` reaches `2` or when `cnt[i]` becomes `0`. The exact value of `i` at which the loop breaks will be printed.

Thus, the final output state can be described as:
- The loop will print the value of `i` at the point where it breaks.
- The state of `t` will be `2` if the loop breaks because `t` reached `2`.
- The state of `cnt` will reflect the counts of elements in `a` up to the point where the loop breaks.

However, without specific values of `N` and `a`, we can't determine the exact value of `i` that will be printed. Therefore, the output state in the required format is:

Output State: **the loop breaks and prints the value of `i` where `t` reaches `2` or `cnt[i]` becomes `0`.**
