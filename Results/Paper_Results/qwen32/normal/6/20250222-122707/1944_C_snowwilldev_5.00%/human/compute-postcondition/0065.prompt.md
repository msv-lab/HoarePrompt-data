Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tc` is `x + 1`, `N` is the input integer, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, `t` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N):
    if cnt[i] == 1:
        t += 1
    if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is `x + 1`, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is 1; otherwise, `t` remains 0. The current value of `t` is either greater than or equal to 2, or `cnt[i]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, the execution continues without modification to `tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, or `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tc` is `x + 1`, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. `i` is `x + 2`. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tc` is `x + 1`, `N` is greater than `x + 3`, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, `i` is `x + 3`. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged and no further action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
