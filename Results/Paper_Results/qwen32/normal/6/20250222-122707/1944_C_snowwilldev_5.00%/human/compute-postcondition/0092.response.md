The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N`.

However, since `i` is already equal to `N`, the loop condition `for i in range(N):` would not allow the loop to execute again because `range(N)` generates values from `0` to `N-1`.

Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `N-1`.

State: **`tc` is `x + 2`, `N` is an integer greater than `x + 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, `i` is `N-1`**
