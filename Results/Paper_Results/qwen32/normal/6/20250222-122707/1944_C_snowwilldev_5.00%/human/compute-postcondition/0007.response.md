The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` within the `cnt` defaultdict. Given that `i` is initialized to `t + 1`, the count of `a[t + 1]` in `cnt` will be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `N` is an input integer and must be greater than `t + 1`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1, specifically `cnt[a[t + 1]]` is incremented by 1; `i` is `t + 1`.**
