Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The provided code seems to be attempting to find the MEX based on the counts of elements in the original array `a`, but it does not account for the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. **Alice's Goal**: Maximize the MEX of the final array `c`.
2. **Bob's Goal**: Minimize the MEX of the final array `c`.

To achieve the optimal play, Alice should aim to include as many small integers as possible in `c` to maximize the MEX, while Bob should try to prevent this by removing elements that Alice would otherwise pick.

The provided code does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not correctly determine the MEX of `c` after all elements have been picked. Instead, it incorrectly tries to determine the MEX based on the counts of elements in the original array `a` without considering the optimal strategy.

A correct approach would involve simulating the turns of Alice and Bob, keeping track of the elements in `c`, and then calculating the MEX of `c` after all elements have been picked.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def mex(arr):
    i = 0
    while i in arr:
        i += 1
    return i

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        c = []
        turn = 0  # 0 for Alice, 1 for Bob
        for i in range(N):
            for num in range(N):
                if cnt[num] > 0:
                    if turn == 0:  # Alice's turn
                        c.append(num)
                    cnt[num] -= 1
                    turn = 1 - turn  # Switch turns
                    break
        
        print(mex(c))

func()
```

This corrected version simulates the game by alternating turns between Alice and Bob, and then calculates the MEX of the final array `c`.
