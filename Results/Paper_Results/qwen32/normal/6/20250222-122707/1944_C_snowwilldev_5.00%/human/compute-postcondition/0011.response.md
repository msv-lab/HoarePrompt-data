The value of `t` is reassigned to 0. The other variables (`N`, `a`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `N` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and the count of each `a[i]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from `t` to `N-1`.**
