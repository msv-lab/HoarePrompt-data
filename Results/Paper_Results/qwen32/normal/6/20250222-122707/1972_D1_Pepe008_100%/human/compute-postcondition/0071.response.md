The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `b` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` is at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is 2, `x` is `a + 1`**
