The code snippet `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the only variable affected is `suma`, which now includes the value of `x`.

Output State: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - i \times (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\), `suma` is `suma + x`.**
