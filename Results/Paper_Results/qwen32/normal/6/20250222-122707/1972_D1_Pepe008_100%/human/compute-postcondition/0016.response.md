The code snippet `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is `suma + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**
