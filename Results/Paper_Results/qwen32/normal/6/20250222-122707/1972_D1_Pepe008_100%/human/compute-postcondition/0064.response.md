Postcondition: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` is at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - b^2 - b}{b^2 + 2b + 1}\right) + 1\). If \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0\), then the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold, and no further changes are made to the variables.**

This postcondition captures the state of the variables after executing the if-else block, considering the condition provided in the if statement.
