The code snippet `suma += x` increments the variable `suma` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, we know that `x` is `a + 1`. Therefore, `suma` will be updated to its current value plus `a + 1`.

Output State: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` is at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is 1, `x` is `a + 1`, `suma` is increased by `a + 1`.**
