### Reasoning: 

Let's systematically analyze the given program and the annotated version to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

#### Annotations:
The annotations state that:
- The program reads \(a\) and \(b\) from the input.
- It initializes `suma` to 0 and iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
- It calculates `x` using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
- If `x` is positive, it adds `x` to `suma`.
- It checks an additional condition and increments `suma` by 1 if the condition is met.
- Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Variable Usage**:
   - The variables `a` and `b` in the problem should represent the upper limits for the ranges of \(a\) and \(b\) respectively.
   - In the program, `a` is used as the upper limit for `i`, and `b` is used as the limit for the loop over `i`. This is incorrect because `i` should iterate over possible values of `b`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Pair Calculation**:
   - The logic `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not correctly translate the problem's requirement.
   - The condition `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is not meaningful in the context of the problem.

3. **Off-by-One Errors**:
   - The final output is `suma - 2`, which is not explained and seems incorrect.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It has incorrect variable usage, logic errors, and off-by-one errors. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
