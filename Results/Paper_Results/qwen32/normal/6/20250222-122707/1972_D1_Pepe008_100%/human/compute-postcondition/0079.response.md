To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how the loop processes each test case and accumulates results. The loop runs `T` times, where `T` is the initial value of `t`. For each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, computes a sum `suma` based on a specific formula, and then prints `suma - 2`.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initialization**: The loop initializes `suma` to 0 for each test case.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each `i` from 1 to `b`, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. If `x` is greater than 0, it adds `x` to `suma`. Additionally, if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, it adds an extra 1 to `suma`.
3. **Output**: After the inner loop completes, it prints `suma - 2`.

The final output state after all iterations will be the result of executing the above process for each of the `T` test cases. Since the output of each test case is independent of the others, the final output state will be a series of printed values, one for each test case.

Given the format requirement, here is the final output state:

Output State: **For each of the T test cases, the output is the value of `suma - 2` after processing the corresponding `a` and `b` values.**

In simpler terms, the output state is a series of integers, each representing the result of the computation for a specific test case, printed one after the other.
