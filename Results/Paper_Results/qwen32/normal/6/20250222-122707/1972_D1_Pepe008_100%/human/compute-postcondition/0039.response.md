The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters `1` and `b + 1`. Since the loop iterates from `1` to `b` inclusive, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `b + 1`, which means the loop has just finished executing. To execute one more time, `i` should be less than `b + 1`. However, since the loop has just finished, the next logical step is to consider the state right before the loop ends, which would be `i` being `b`.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the start of the current iteration if we consider the loop hasn't finished yet) should have `i` adjusted to the next value it would take in the sequence, which is `b + 1` if we are considering the loop has just completed, or `i` should be `b` if we are considering the state right before the loop ends.

Since the task specifies the state at the start of the next iteration, and the loop has just finished with `i` being `b + 1`, there is no next iteration possible unless we reset `i` to the start of the loop range.

However, if we interpret the task as asking for the state right before the loop ends (which is the last valid state of the loop), then `i` should be `b`.

State: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b`, and `suma` is `x` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**
