The code calculates the value of `x` based on the given formula and the initial state of the variables. The other variables remain unchanged.

The formula used is:
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \times (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]

Given:
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `i` is `b + 1`
- `b` must be at least 1
- `T` is greater than 0

Let's calculate the value of `x` using the given formula:
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - (b + 1) \times ((b + 1) - 1)}{(b + 1)^2}\right) + 1 \]
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - (b + 1) \times b}{(b + 1)^2}\right) + 1 \]
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - b^2 - b}{b^2 + 2b + 1}\right) + 1 \]

The values of `info`, `b`, `T`, `a`, and `i` remain the same, and `suma` is not affected.

Output State: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` must be at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is 0, `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - b^2 - b}{b^2 + 2b + 1}\right) + 1\)**
