Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. `T` still must be greater than 0. `info` is still a list of substrings. The new variables `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values of the first and second elements of `info`, respectively.
