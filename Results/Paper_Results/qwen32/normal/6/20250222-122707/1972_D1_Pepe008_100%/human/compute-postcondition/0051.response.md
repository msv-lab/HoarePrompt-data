To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to follow the loop's behavior and compute the final values of the variables `i` and `suma` based on the given initial state and the loop's logic.

### Loop Analysis:

The loop iterates from `1` to `b` (inclusive). For each iteration, the following steps occur:
1. `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
2. If `x` is greater than `0`, `suma` is incremented by `x`.
3. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, `suma` is incremented by `1`.

### Iteration Details:

Let's break down the iterations based on the given initial state and the behavior of the loop:

- **Iteration 1 (i = 1)**:
  - `x = (a - 1 * 0) // 1 ** 2 + 1 = a + 1`
  - If `a + 1 > 0`, `suma += a + 1`
  - Check if `(a - 0) % 1 == 0` and `0 % 1 == 0` (always true), so `suma += 1` if the first condition is met.
  - Final `suma` after iteration 1: `suma = a + 2` if `a + 1 > 0`

- **Iteration 2 (i = 2)**:
  - `x = (a - 2 * 1) // 2 ** 2 + 1 = (a - 2) // 4 + 1`
  - If `(a - 2) // 4 + 1 > 0`, `suma += (a - 2) // 4 + 1`
  - Check if `(a - 2) % 4 == 0` and `2 % 4 == 0` (second condition is never true), so `suma` is not incremented further in this step.
  - Final `suma` after iteration 2: `suma = a + 2 + ((a - 2) // 4 + 1)` if `(a - 2) // 4 + 1 > 0`

- **Iteration 3 (i = 3)**:
  - `x = (a - 3 * 2) // 3 ** 2 + 1 = (a - 6) // 9 + 1`
  - If `(a - 6) // 9 + 1 > 0`, `suma += (a - 6) // 9 + 1`
  - Check if `(a - 6) % 9 == 0` and `6 % 9 == 0` (second condition is never true), so `suma` is not incremented further in this step.
  - Final `suma` after iteration 3: `suma = a + 2 + ((a - 2) // 4 + 1) + ((a - 6) // 9 + 1)` if respective conditions are met

### Generalized Formula for `suma`:

The loop runs from `1` to `b`, so the final value of `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated in each iteration where `x > 0`. The value of `i` at the end of the loop is `b + 1`.

### Final Output State:

After all iterations, the final output state is:

Output State: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, and `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated in each iteration where `x > 0`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` will be `b + 1`, and `suma` will be the total sum of all valid `x` values calculated during each iteration.
