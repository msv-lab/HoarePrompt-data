### Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The provided code snippet attempts to solve this problem by iterating over possible values of \(b\) and calculating a value \(x\) that seems to be related to the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). However, the logic used to compute \(x\) and the final result does not align with the problem requirements.

Let's break down the problem and the code:

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This translates to checking if \((a + b) \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - It then modifies `suma` based on this \(x\) and additional conditions.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2` for each test case.

The logic in the code does not correctly implement the required condition. The calculation of \(x\) and the subsequent adjustments to `suma` do not reflect the problem's requirements accurately.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
