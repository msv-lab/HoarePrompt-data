The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `b + 2`, and `T` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` will be `b + 3`.

State: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 3`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, and `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated in each iteration where `x > 0`.**
