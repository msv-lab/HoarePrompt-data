The only object in the loop head is the variable `line`. The loop iterates over every second line starting from the third line of the input file. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `line` contained valid input data from the third line (or a subsequent line, if this is not the first iteration). For the loop to execute one more time, `line` must contain valid input data from the next line in the sequence (i.e., the next line after the current `line`, skipping one line in between).

Given that the input file must have at least three lines and the loop starts from the third line, the next valid state for `line` would be the data from the fifth line (if this is the first iteration), or the line after the current `line` skipping one line in between (for subsequent iterations).

State: **The input file must have at least three lines, where the first line is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), and the third line (which was `line` in the first iteration of the loop) contains valid input data. `line` now contains valid input data from the next line in the sequence (skipping one line).**
