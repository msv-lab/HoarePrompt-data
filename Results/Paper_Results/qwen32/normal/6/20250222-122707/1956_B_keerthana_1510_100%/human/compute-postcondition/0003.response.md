Let's break down the provided code snippet and initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. The input file has at least three lines.
2. The first line is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
3. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).
4. The third line contains valid input data, and `line` is now assigned the input data from the next line in the sequence (skipping one line).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
```

### Explanation:
1. **`line.split()`**: This splits the `line` variable (which contains a string of space-separated values) into a list of strings called `tokens`.
2. **`len(tokens)`**: This calculates the number of elements in the `tokens` list, which is the number of space-separated values in the `line`.
3. **`{*tokens}`**: This converts the `tokens` list into a set, which removes any duplicate elements. The `{*tokens}` syntax is a shorthand for `set(tokens)`.
4. **`len({*tokens})`**: This calculates the number of unique elements in the `tokens` list.
5. **`len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`**: This computes the difference between the total number of elements and the number of unique elements. This difference represents the number of duplicate elements in the `line`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the number of duplicate elements in the `line`.

### Final Output:
Output: **number of duplicate elements in the `line`**
