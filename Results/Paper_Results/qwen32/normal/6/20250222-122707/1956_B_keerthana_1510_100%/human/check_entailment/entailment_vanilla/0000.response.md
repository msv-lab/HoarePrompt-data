To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze whether the program implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

The problem requires us to calculate the maximum number of points you can get if you play optimally, given that Nene plays optimally as well. The key point is that you gain a point when you play a card that has already been placed on the table by either player.

The provided program, however, does not implement this logic. Instead, it calculates the difference between the number of cards you have and the number of unique cards you have. This calculation is not relevant to the problem at hand. The number of unique cards you have does not directly translate to the maximum points you can earn, as it does not account for Nene's optimal play or the sequence in which cards are played.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to maximize the points you can get based on the optimal play by both you and Nene.
2. **Program Logic**: The program calculates the difference between the total number of cards you have and the number of unique cards. This does not account for the sequence of play or the strategy of either player.
3. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the first test case, the correct output is 1, but the program would output 1 (which is coincidentally correct in this case, but not due to correct logic).
   - In the second test case, the correct output is 2, but the program would output 2 (again, coincidentally correct but not due to correct logic).
   - In the third test case, the correct output is 1, but the program would output 3, which is incorrect.
   - In the fourth test case, the correct output is 0, but the program would output 3, which is incorrect.
   - In the fifth test case, the correct output is 0, but the program would output 1, which is incorrect.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
