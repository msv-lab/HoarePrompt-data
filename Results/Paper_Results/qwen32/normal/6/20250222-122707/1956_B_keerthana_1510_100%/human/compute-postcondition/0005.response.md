Let's break down the code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. The input file has at least three lines.
2. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
3. The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).
4. The variable `line` contains valid input data from the next line in the sequence (skipping one line).

### Code Analysis:
```python
print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
```

1. **`line.split()`**: This splits the `line` string into a list of tokens (words) based on whitespace. Let's assume `line` is a string containing space-separated values.
2. **`tokens := line.split()`**: This is an assignment expression (walrus operator) that assigns the result of `line.split()` to `tokens`. So, `tokens` is now a list of strings.
3. **`{*tokens}`**: This creates a set from `tokens`. A set in Python contains unique elements, so any duplicate tokens will be removed.
4. **`len(tokens)`**: This computes the length of the list `tokens`, which is the number of tokens (words) in `line`.
5. **`len({*tokens})`**: This computes the length of the set created from `tokens`, which is the number of unique tokens in `line`.
6. **`len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`**: This computes the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens. This difference represents the number of duplicate tokens in `line`.

### Output:
The code will print the number of duplicate tokens in the `line` string.

Since the exact content of `line` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the number of duplicate tokens in `line`.

Output: **number of duplicate tokens in `line` (where `line` is a string containing space-separated values)**
