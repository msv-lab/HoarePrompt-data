Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the possibility that there are not enough universals to fulfill the requirements of the extroverts when the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. Additionally, `func_2` does not handle the scenario where the number of introverts exceeds the number of available tents.

Let's consider a specific test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2 1 0
```

**Explanation of the Test Case:**
- There are 2 introverts, 1 extrovert, and 0 universals.
- Each introvert needs a tent alone, so 2 tents are needed for the introverts.
- The extrovert needs a tent with 2 others, but there are no universals available, so it is impossible to accommodate the extrovert's preference.

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1
```

The program incorrectly returns `1` because `func_1` does not return `None` in this case, and `func_2` adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` without checking if it is possible to accommodate the extroverts.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case.
