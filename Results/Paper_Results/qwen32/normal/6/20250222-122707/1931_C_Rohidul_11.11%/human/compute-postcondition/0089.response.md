The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` was `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`.

The other variables (`l`, `end`, `ans`, and `st`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 2`, `end` is 1, `ans` is determined by initial conditions, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start, and `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`.**
