The code snippet assigns the value `0` to `l` and `n - 1` to `r`. This means that the variables `l` and `r` are now set to these specific values, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the list of integers from the input; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0; `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list. If the first and last elements of `a` are equal, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a` and both `st` and `end` are 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
