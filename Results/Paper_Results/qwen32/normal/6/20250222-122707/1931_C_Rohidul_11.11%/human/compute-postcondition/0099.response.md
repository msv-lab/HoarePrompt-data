The code snippet assigns the value of `len(a) - 1` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `ans` is now `len(a) - 1`, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`l` is `0`, `r` is `0`, `end` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `len(a) - 1`, `st` is `0`, `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`.**
