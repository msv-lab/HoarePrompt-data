Postcondition: **`n` is greater than `m + 2`, `m` is `m + 2`, `nabors` is `nabors - 1`, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `aa` is a new list of integers read from the input, `bb` is a new list of integers read from the input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the sublist `aa[:m + 2]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts occurrences of each integer in the list `bb`, `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D`, `fnd` is 3 if `tot >= k`, otherwise `fnd` is 2. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `E[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**
