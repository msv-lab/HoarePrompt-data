Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` where `1 <= k <= m <= n`, and two lists `a` and `b` of sizes `n` and `m` respectively, with each element in `a` and `b` being an integer between 1 and 1,000,000. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
