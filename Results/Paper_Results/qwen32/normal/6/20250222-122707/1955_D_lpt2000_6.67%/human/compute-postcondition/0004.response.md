The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `bb`. The variables `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `aa` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `aa` is a list of integers read from the input; `bb` is a list of integers read from the input.**
