The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `aa`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. The precondition that `nabors` must be greater than 0 is still valid, and no changes are made to `nabors` by the code.

Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `aa` is a list of integers read from the input.**
