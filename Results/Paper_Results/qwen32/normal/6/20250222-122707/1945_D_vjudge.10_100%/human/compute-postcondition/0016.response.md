Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `pergunta` (the number of test cases), `a` (a list of integers representing the costs for each person in the queue), `b` (a list of integers representing the costs for each person in the queue), `n` (the number of people in the queue besides Kirill), and `m` (the maximum allowable final position of Kirill). For each test case, the function returns the minimum cost required to position Kirill at a position from 0 to m in the queue.**
