Postcondition: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]` if `i < m`. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged. `a` and `b` are lists of integers; `n` is the number of people in the queue besides Kirill; `m` is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill; `x` is `2 * min(a[i], b[i])`; `i` is `n - 3`.**
