The code snippet `x += min(a[i], b[i])` adds the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the current value of `x`. Given the initial state, `x` was initially 0, so `x` will now be equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`. The values of `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its current value and `a[n - 1]` if `i < m`. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged; `a` and `b` are lists of integers; `n` is the number of people in the queue besides Kirill; `m` is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill; `x` is `min(a[i], b[i])`; `i` is `n - 1`.**
