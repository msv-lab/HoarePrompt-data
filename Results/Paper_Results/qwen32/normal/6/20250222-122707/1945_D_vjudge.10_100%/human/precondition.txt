pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4). For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and b is a list of n integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
