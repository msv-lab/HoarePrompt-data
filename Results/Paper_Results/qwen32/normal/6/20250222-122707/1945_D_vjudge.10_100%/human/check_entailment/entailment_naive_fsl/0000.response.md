Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. Here are a few issues and a counterexample to demonstrate why the code is incorrect:

1. **Function Call and Parameters**: The function `func_1` is called with parameters `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`, but `pergunta` is initialized as `float('inf')` and passed to the function, which seems unnecessary. The function should handle the logic internally and return the result.

2. **Logic for Minimum Coins**: The logic inside `func_1` does not correctly account for the cost of bribing people between positions `j` and `i`. The code only adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x` in each iteration, which does not reflect the correct cost calculation.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, it does not correctly calculate the cost when Kirill needs to bribe multiple people to move to a position within the first `m` people.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Counterexample:**

```
Input:
1
5 3
5 4 3 2 1
1 1 1 1 1

Expected Output:
10
```

**Explanation of Counterexample:**

In this example, Kirill needs to be among the first 3 people. The optimal strategy would be to bribe the 4th person (cost 2) and the 5th person (cost 1), and then bribe the 3rd person (cost 3). The total cost would be `2 + 1 + 3 = 6`. However, the given code would not correctly compute this and might return a higher value or an incorrect result.

Since the provided code does not correctly handle the cost calculation and does not account for all possible bribes, it is incorrect.

Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
