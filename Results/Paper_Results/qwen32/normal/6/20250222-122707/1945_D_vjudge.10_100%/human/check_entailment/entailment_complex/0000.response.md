### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in a queue. The logic of the program seems flawed based on the given explanation and example outputs.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initialization of `pergunta`:** The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')` which is correct as it needs to be updated with the minimum cost found. However, it is passed as an argument to `func_1`, but `func_1` reassigns it without using the initial value from the main loop. This is not a critical issue, but it is unconventional.

2. **Logic in `func_1`:** The core logic in `func_1` is flawed. The loop iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning, and for each position `i`:
   - If `i < m`, it tries to update `pergunta` with the minimum cost to move Kirill to that position, which is `x + a[i]`.
   - It then updates `x` by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it.
   
   The issue is that `x` is not correctly representing the accumulated cost to move Kirill to position `i`. The cost to move Kirill to position `i` should not simply be the accumulated minimum of `a` and `b` values up to `i`. Instead, it should consider the cost to move Kirill directly from his current position to position `i`.

3. **Handling of Costs:** The cost to move Kirill from position `i` to position `j` involves paying `a[j]` to the person at position `j` and `b[k]` for all `j < k < i`. The current implementation does not correctly account for this.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the logic in `func_1`, the program is not correctly implementing the required algorithm to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
