The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 2` (since it is decremented by 1 from `n - 1`).

The other variables (`pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `x`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its current value and `a[n - 1]` if `i < m`. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged; `a` and `b` are lists of integers; `n` is the number of people in the queue besides Kirill; `m` is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill; `x` is `min(a[i], b[i])`; `i` is `n - 2`**
