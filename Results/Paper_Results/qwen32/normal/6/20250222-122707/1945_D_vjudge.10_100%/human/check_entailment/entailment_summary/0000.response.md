### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position among the first `m` people in the queue. The cost depends on the `a_i` and `b_i` values for each person in the queue.

Let's break down the provided program and see if it correctly addresses the problem:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of people in queue excluding Kirill) and `m` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill).
   - It then reads two lists `a` and `b` of `n` integers each.

2. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position from 0 to `m`.
   - It initializes `pergunta` to infinity, which is intended to store the minimum cost.
   - It iterates through the queue from the end to the beginning (from `n-1` to `0`).
   - For each position `i`, if `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` with the minimum of its current value and the cost of moving to position `i` (which is `x + a[i]`).
   - It updates `x` by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it.

3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The logic in the loop seems flawed. The variable `x` is not correctly representing the cumulative cost for Kirill to move to a certain position.
   - The condition `if i < m` is checking if the position `i` is within the allowable range, but the cost calculation `x + a[i]` does not take into account the costs `b_k` for people between `j` and `i` when Kirill moves from position `i` to `j`.
   - The function does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to move Kirill to any of the positions from 0 to `m` considering all the intermediate costs.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve using a priority queue or a dynamic programming strategy to keep track of the minimum cost to move Kirill to each position up to `m`, considering both `a_i` and `b_i` costs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not properly account for all the costs involved in moving Kirill to the desired positions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
