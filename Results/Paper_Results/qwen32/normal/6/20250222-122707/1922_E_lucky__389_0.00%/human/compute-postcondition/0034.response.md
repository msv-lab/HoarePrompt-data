The provided code snippet is:
```python
mx = max(mx, i)
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18
- `x` is greater than 0 and specifically `x` is `x - (2` (This seems incomplete, but we will proceed with the given information)
- `mx` is not defined in the initial state, but we can infer it must be defined somewhere in the code not provided here.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, but we can infer it must be defined somewhere in the code not provided here.

The code snippet updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. 

Since the values of `mx` and `i` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine specific numeric values for them after the execution of the code. However, we can describe the relationship between them after the execution.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is greater than 0 and specifically `x` is `x - (2`, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**
