Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the significant bits of the original `x` + 1, `mx` is the maximum value of `i` encountered during the loop, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx - 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `ansv` has been assigned a list of integers starting from 0 up to `mx - 1`. All other variables (`t`, `X`, `x`, and `subseq_lens`) retain their initial values.
