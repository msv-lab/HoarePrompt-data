Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and the largest integer i such that 2^(i + 1) <= x + 1, and `i` is the largest integer such that 2^(i + 1) <= x + 1. The current value of `i` is 0.**
