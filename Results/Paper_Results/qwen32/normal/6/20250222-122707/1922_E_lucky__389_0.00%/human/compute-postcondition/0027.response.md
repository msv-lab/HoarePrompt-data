Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` must be at least 7, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0 if `i` was initially 0, otherwise `mx` is max(`mx`, `i`), and `i` is 3.**

Natural Language: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so `i` is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
