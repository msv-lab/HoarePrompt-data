You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
- The array can have a length of at most 200.
- If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.
- If multiple arrays are possible, any of them is acceptable.

### Key Observations:
1. **Increasing Subsequences**: The problem revolves around generating increasing subsequences. The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be calculated based on how many elements can be chosen in different ways to form increasing subsequences.
2. **Binary Representation**: The program seems to leverage binary representation to determine the lengths of increasing subsequences. It tries to decompose `X-1` into a sum of powers of 2, which can help in constructing the array.

### Program Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: The program reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `X`.
- **Adjustment**: It subtracts 1 from `X` to simplify the counting process.
- **Binary Decomposition**: It attempts to decompose `X-1` into a sum of powers of 2. This is done by finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X+1` and subtracting it from `X`, then repeating until `X` becomes 0.
- **Array Construction**: The program constructs an array based on the lengths of the subsequences derived from the binary decomposition. It starts with a sequence of increasing integers `[0, 1, ..., mx-1]` and appends additional elements based on the lengths found.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incomplete Array Construction**: The program constructs the array based on the lengths of the subsequences but doesn't ensure that the resulting array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `X` is very large or when `X` cannot be represented by the binary decomposition method used.
3. **Output Format**: The program prints the array elements in a single line without a newline at the end, which might not conform to the problem's output requirements.

### Example Analysis:
Let's analyze the example provided:
- For `X=2`, the program should output an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences. The output `[0]` is incorrect because `[0]` has 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`, but the program doesn't handle this correctly.
- For `X=5`, the output `[0 1 0]` is incorrect because it does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences.
- For `X=13`, the output `[2 2 3 4 2]` is incorrect for the same reason.
- For `X=37`, the output `[-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1]` is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to construct the array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences and does not handle edge cases properly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
