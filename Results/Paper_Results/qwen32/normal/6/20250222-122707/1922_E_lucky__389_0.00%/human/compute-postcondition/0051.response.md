Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `subseq_lens` is either an empty list or contains the value of `i`, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`, and `i` is the largest integer such that 2^(i + 1) <= x + 1. If `i` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without modifying `subseq_lens` or `x`. Otherwise, `subseq_lens` contains the value of `i`, `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`, and `x` is updated to `X - (2^(i + 1))`.**
