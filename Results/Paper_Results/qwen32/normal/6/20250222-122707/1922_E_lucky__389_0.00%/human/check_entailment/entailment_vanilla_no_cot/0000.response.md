Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of finding an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. The logic for constructing the array based on the number of increasing subsequences is flawed. The approach seems to be attempting to decompose the number of subsequences into sums of powers of 2, but it does not guarantee that the resulting array will have the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by X. Additionally, the program does not handle cases where it is impossible to construct such an array, and it does not format the output correctly for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
