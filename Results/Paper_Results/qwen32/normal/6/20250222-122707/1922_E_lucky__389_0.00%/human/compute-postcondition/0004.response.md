To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `x != 0`. According to the given state, `x` is defined as the input value minus 1. 

For the loop to execute, `x` must not be equal to 0. This means that the input value must not be 1, because if the input value is 1, then `x` would be 0, and the loop would not execute.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:
- `x` must be different from 0, which implies that the input value must be different from 1.

Given that `x` is the input value minus 1, we can infer that the input value must be at least 2 to ensure `x` is not 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is the input value minus 1 and the input value must be at least 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0**
