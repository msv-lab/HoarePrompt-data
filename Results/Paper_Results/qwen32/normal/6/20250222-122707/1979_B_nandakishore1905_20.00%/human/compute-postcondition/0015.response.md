To determine the output of the `print(k - q)` statement, let's break down the given information and the relationships between the variables step by step.

1. **Variables and their Definitions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. This variable does not directly affect the output of the print statement.
   - `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., `k = abs(n - m)`.
   - `k` is not a power of 2.
   - It is not the case that `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, and it is not the case that `n` is 0 and `m` is even.
   - `l` is the binary string representation of `k`.
   - `p` is the length of the binary string `l`.
   - `q` is 2 raised to the power of (`p - 1`), i.e., `q = 2^(p - 1)`.

2. **Understanding `k` and `q`:**
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and it is not a power of 2. This means `k` in binary form has more than one '1' bit or it is not of the form `2^x` for any integer `x`.
   - `p` is the length of the binary string `l`. For example, if `k` is 10 (binary: 1010), then `p` is 4.
   - `q` is `2^(p - 1)`, which is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. For example, if `k` is 10 (binary: 1010) and `p` is 4, then `q` is `2^(4-1) = 2^3 = 8`.

3. **Calculating `k - q`:**
   - `k - q` will be the difference between `k` and the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This difference will be a non-negative integer that is less than `q`.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `n` is 15 and `m` is 5. Then `k = abs(15 - 5) = 10`.
   - The binary representation of `k` (10) is `1010`, so `p = 4`.
   - `q = 2^(4-1) = 8`.
   - `k - q = 10 - 8 = 2`.

Given the initial state and the relationships between the variables, the output of the print statement `print(k - q)` will be the difference between `k` and `2^(p-1)`, where `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.

Output: **k - q (where k is the absolute difference between n and m, and q is 2 raised to the power of (length of the binary representation of k minus 1))**
