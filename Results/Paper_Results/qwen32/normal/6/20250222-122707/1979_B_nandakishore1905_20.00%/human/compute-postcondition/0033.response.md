The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This means the previous values of `n` and `m` are overwritten. The value of `k`, which was the absolute difference between the previous `n` and `m`, is no longer valid since `n` and `m` have new values. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is still incremented by 1, but since `i` was not defined in the initial state, we can only state that it is incremented by 1 from whatever value it had before.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `k` is no longer valid, `i` is incremented by 1**.
