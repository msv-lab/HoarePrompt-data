Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    k = abs(n - m)
    if k & k - 1 == 0:
        print(k)
    elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
        print(1)
    elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
        print(2)
    else:
        l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
        p = len(l)
        q = 2 ** (p - 1)
        print(k - q)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, then no additional changes are made. Otherwise, if `n` is not 0 or `m` is not even, `l` is the binary string representation of `k`, `p` is the length of the binary string `l`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of (`p - 1`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `l` is the binary string representation of `k`, `p` is the length of the binary string `l`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of (`p - 1`). If `n` is not 0 or `m` is not even, `i` is incremented by 1. If `n == 0 and m % 2 == 0`, no additional changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `k` is `abs(n - m)`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `k & (k - 1) == 0`, the program does nothing additional. Otherwise, if `n` is not 0 or `m` is not even, `l` is the binary string representation of `k`, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is set to 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
