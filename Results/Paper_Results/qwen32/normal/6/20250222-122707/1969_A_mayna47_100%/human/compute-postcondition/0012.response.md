The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given that `i` is 2 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3. The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted because it remains constant throughout the loop.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is the integer value from the input (where 2 <= `n` <= 50); `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`; `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is `0` and the remaining `n` elements are the integers read from the input; `i` is 3**
