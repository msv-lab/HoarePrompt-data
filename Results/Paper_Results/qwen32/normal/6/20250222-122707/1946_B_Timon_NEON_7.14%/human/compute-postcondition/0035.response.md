The code assigns `new_segment` the value of a list containing `arr[i]` and `i`. Given that `i` is `i + 1` from the initial state, the value of `i` is incremented before this operation. Therefore, `new_segment` will be a list where the first element is the element at the new index `i` in `arr`, and the second element is the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a list containing `[arr[i + 1], i + 1]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
