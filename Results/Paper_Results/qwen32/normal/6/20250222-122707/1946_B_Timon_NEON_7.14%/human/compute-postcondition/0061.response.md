The only object in the loop head is `segment`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `segments_variants` list. If `segments_variants` contains more than one segment, the loop will execute again for the next segment.

At the end of the last iteration, `segments_variants` contains at least one segment. For the loop to execute one more time, `segments_variants` must contain at least two segments. The `segment` variable will be assigned the next segment in `segments_variants`.

Given the current state, let's assume `segments_variants` contains two segments: the first one being `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and the second one being `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`. After the first iteration, `segment` was `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`. In the next iteration, `segment` will be `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.

State: **`arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains at least two segments (either `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`); `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment` if `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]`, otherwise it remains `[-1]`; `segment` is `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`**
