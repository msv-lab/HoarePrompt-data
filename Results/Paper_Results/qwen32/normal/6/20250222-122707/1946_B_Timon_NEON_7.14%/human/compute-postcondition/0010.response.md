The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`, which is the concatenation of `new_segment` and a list containing `i - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a non-empty list; `max_segment` is [0, 0]; `segments_variants` is a list containing the new segment `new_segment + [i - 1]`; `max_sum` is -1. The current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. Additionally, `max_segment[0]` is less than or equal to `new_segment[0]`.**
