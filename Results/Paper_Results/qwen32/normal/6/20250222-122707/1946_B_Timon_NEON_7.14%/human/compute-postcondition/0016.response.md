The code snippet `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` adds the value of `arr[i]` to the first element of the list `max_segment`. Given that `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, the first element of `max_segment` will increase by this non-negative value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a non-empty list; `max_segment` is [`max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, 0]; `segments_variants` is an empty list; `max_sum` is -1.**
