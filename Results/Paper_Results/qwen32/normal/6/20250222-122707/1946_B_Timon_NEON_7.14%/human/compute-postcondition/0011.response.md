The code snippet assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. Therefore, `max_segment` now holds the same list of integers as `new_segment`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a non-empty list; `max_segment` is `new_segment`; `segments_variants` is a list containing the new segment `new_segment + [i - 1]`; `max_sum` is -1. The current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. Additionally, `max_segment[0]` is less than or equal to `new_segment[0]`.**
