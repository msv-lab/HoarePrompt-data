To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `segment` in the `for segment in segments_variants` loop.

### Analysis:
1. **segments_variants**: This list must contain at least one segment for the loop to execute.
2. **segment**: This variable will take on the value of each element in `segments_variants` during each iteration of the loop. No specific adjustment is needed for `segment` itself, but we need to ensure `segments_variants` has at least one element.

### Adjustments:
- **segments_variants**: It must contain at least one segment. Given the description, `segments_variants` includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`. To ensure the loop executes, `segments_variants` should have at least one of these segments.

### State Adjustment:
Since `segments_variants` must contain at least one segment and it already includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, we need to ensure that at least one of these segments is present. Given the current description, we can assume that `max_segment` and `new_segment` are valid segments, and thus `segments_variants` will have at least one element.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains at least one segment (either `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` or `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`); `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`**

This ensures that the loop can execute because `segments_variants` will have at least one element to iterate over.
