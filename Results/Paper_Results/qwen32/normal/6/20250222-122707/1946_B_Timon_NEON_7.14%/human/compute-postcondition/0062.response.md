Output State: **`arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains at least two segments (either `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`); `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment`; `segment` is `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `total_max_segment` has been updated to be equal to `segment`. All other variables remain unchanged.
