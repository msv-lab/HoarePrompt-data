Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `i` is incremented by 1 if `arr[i] < 0` and `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, otherwise `i` is incremented by 1; `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i] < 0`, otherwise the first element of `new_segment` is updated to its original value plus `arr[i]`; `segments_variants` includes an additional list which is `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i] < 0` and `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, otherwise it contains the previous elements of `segments_variants` plus a new element which is `new_segment` concatenated with `[i - 1]`; `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]` if `arr[i] < 0` and `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, otherwise `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`.**
