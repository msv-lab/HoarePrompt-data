Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is an empty list; `i` is `i + 1`. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` has a new appended element which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` includes a new list which is `new_segment + [i]` and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
max_segment[0] += arr[i]
```

This line of code adds the integer at index `i` in the list `arr` to the first element of the list `max_segment`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is an empty list; `i` is `i + 1`; `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`.**

In natural language: The first element of `max_segment` is updated to be its previous value plus the integer at index `i` in the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
