The code snippet `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the first element of the list `new_segment` by adding to it the value of `arr[i]`. This means that the value of `new_segment[0]` is now the sum of its previous value and `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a non-empty list where `new_segment[0]` is the previous `new_segment[0]` plus `arr[i]`; `max_segment` is [`max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, 0]; `segments_variants` is an empty list; `max_sum` is -1.**

In simple terms, the first element of `new_segment` has been updated by adding `arr[i]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged.
