The code snippet `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` increments the first element of the list `max_segment` by the value of `arr[i]`. 

Given the initial state, `max_segment` is initially `[0, 0]`, and `arr[i]` is an integer from the list `arr`. After the operation, the first element of `max_segment` becomes `0 + arr[i]`, which is `arr[i]`.

The other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a list containing the current element `arr[i]` and its index `i` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0; `max_segment` is `[arr[i], 0]; `segments_variants` is an empty list; `max_sum` is -1.**
