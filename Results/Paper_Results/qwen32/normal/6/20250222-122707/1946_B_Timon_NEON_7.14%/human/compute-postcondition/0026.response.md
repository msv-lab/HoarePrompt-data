The code appends a new list to `segments_variants` by combining `max_segment` with a list containing the value `i - 1`. The value of `i` is not updated in the code snippet provided, but it is mentioned in the initial state that `i` is `i + 1`, which suggests that `i` has already been incremented elsewhere in the code.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a list; `i` is `i + 1`; `segments_variants` has a new appended element which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`.**

In simpler terms, `segments_variants` now includes a new list that is the combination of `max_segment` and a list containing the value `i - 1`. All other variables remain as they were in the initial state.
