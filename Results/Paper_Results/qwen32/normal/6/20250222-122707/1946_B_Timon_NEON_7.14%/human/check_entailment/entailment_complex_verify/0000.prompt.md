You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incomplete Logic**: The function `func_3` is defined but not implemented. It seems like it should be the main function that processes each test case and computes the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. However, the current implementation of `func_3` is empty and does not perform any operations.

2. **Suboptimal Subarray Selection**: The function `func_2` attempts to find the maximum sum subarray, but it does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if all elements in the array are negative, the function should return an empty subarray (sum of 0). However, the current implementation might not handle this correctly.

3. **Modulo Operation**: While `func_1` correctly computes the modulo operation, it is not being used in the main logic of the program. The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It should read the number of test cases `t` and process each test case separately.

5. **General Approach**: The problem requires a strategic approach to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations. The optimal strategy is to repeatedly add the maximum sum subarray to the array, as this will yield the highest possible sum. The provided code does not implement this strategy.

Here is a brief outline of what the correct implementation should look like:

- Read the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, read `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
- Find the maximum sum subarray using Kadane's algorithm.
- Compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations by repeatedly adding the maximum sum subarray.
- Output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given these issues, the current program is incorrect and does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
