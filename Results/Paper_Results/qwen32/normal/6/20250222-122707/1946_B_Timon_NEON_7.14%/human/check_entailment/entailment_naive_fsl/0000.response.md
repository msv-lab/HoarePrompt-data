Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incomplete Logic**: The function `func_3` is defined but not implemented. It seems like it should be the main function that processes each test case and computes the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. However, the current implementation of `func_3` is empty and does not perform any operations.

2. **Suboptimal Subarray Selection**: The function `func_2` attempts to find the maximum sum subarray, but it does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if all elements in the array are negative, the function should return an empty subarray (sum of 0). However, the current implementation might not handle this correctly.

3. **Modulo Operation**: While `func_1` correctly computes the modulo operation, it is not being used in the main logic of the program. The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It should read the number of test cases `t` and process each test case separately.

5. **General Approach**: The problem requires a strategic approach to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations. The optimal strategy is to repeatedly add the maximum sum subarray to the array, as this will yield the highest possible sum. The provided code does not implement this strategy.

Here is a brief outline of what the correct implementation should look like:

- Read the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, read `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
- Find the maximum sum subarray using Kadane's algorithm.
- Compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations by repeatedly adding the maximum sum subarray.
- Output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given these issues, the current program is incorrect and does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
