The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is the concatenation of `new_segment` and a list containing the value `i - 1`. The values of `arr`, `new_segment`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` has already been incremented by 1 in the initial state description, so it is effectively `i + 1` before the code execution and `i + 1 - 1 = i` in the new segment.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a list; `i` is `i + 1`; `segments_variants` includes a new list which is `new_segment + [i]`.**
