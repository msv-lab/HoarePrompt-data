### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to understand the strategy of the game and how the program simulates this strategy.

1. **Game Strategy**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX (minimum excludant) of the final array `c`.
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of the final array `c`.
   - The game ends when all elements are picked and `a` is empty.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice should try to ensure that the smallest missing non-negative integer in `c` is as large as possible.
   - Bob, on the other hand, should try to ensure that the smallest missing non-negative integer in `c` is as small as possible.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program calculates the frequency of each integer in the array `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the integers from 0 to n.
   - If it finds an integer that appears 0 times in `arr`, it prints that integer (since this integer is not in `c` at all, making it the MEX).
   - If it finds an integer that appears exactly once in `arr`, it increments a counter `cou`.
   - When `cou` reaches 2 (meaning two integers appear exactly once), or when it finds an integer that appears 0 times, it prints that integer.

5. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that is either missing (appears 0 times) or appears exactly once in the array `arr`.
   - This integer will be the MEX of the final array `c` because:
     - If an integer appears 0 times, it is not in `c` at all.
     - If an integer appears exactly once, it will be included in `c` when Alice picks it, and since Bob doesn't pick it, it will contribute to the MEX calculation.
   - The program ensures that the smallest such integer is selected, which aligns with the optimal strategies of both players.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the MEX of the final array `c` based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: True**
