### Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally on the array `a`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

The strategy described in the program is as follows:
1. Count the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.
2. Traverse the frequency array to find the first index `i` where the frequency is 0 or the second index `i` where the frequency is 1. This index `i` is the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends optimally.

This strategy works because:
- If an integer `i` is missing from `arr` (frequency is 0), then `i` is the MEX.
- If `i` appears exactly once in `arr`, it means it can be added to `c` by Alice on her turn. The next integer that is missing or appears exactly once will be the MEX.
- Since Alice and Bob play optimally, Alice will always pick the smallest available integer to maximize the MEX, and Bob will pick any integer to minimize the MEX. However, the described strategy correctly identifies the MEX by focusing on the first missing integer or the second integer that appears exactly once.

The provided code correctly implements this strategy:
- It counts the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- It then iterates through the frequency array to find the first index with a frequency of 0 or the second index with a frequency of 1.
- It prints this index as the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob have played optimally. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
