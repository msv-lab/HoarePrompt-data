To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and understand the implications for the variable `i`.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. `freq` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements.
2. `n` is at least 0.
3. `i` is initialized to 1.

### Conditions and Implications:
- The value of `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
- The value of `i` is not modified in the given description of the initial state.
- The conditions involving `freq[i]` and `cou` do not affect the value of `i` directly because the description does not include any statements that change `i`.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is initialized to 1 and there are no operations in the provided initial state that modify `i`, the value of `i` remains 1.

### Output:
Output: **1**
