Output State: **`freq` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements, `n` is at least 0, and `i` is 2. If `freq[i]` is 0 or `cou` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` can be either 2 or 1. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `freq[i]`, `n`, `i`, and `cou` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `freq`, `n`, `i`, and `cou` remain unchanged. The conditions for exiting the most internal loop or if statement are still valid as they are.
