Output State: **`freq` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements, `n` is at least 0, `i` is 0, `freq[i]` is either 0 or `cou` is 2, and `cou` is either 1 or 0. If `freq[i]` is 0, `cou` can be either 1 or 0. If `cou` is 2, `freq[i]` can be either 0 or any value other than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the execution of the `break` statement causes us to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of `freq`, `n`, `i`, `freq[i]`, or `cou`.
