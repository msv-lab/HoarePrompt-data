Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `freq` is a list where each index `i` from 0 to n (inclusive) holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `arr`; `cou` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if freq[i] >= 2:
        continue
    if freq[i] == 1:
        cou += 1
    if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `freq` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements, `n` is at least 0, `i` is 0, and `cou` is either 1 or 0. If `freq[i]` is 0, `cou` can be either 1 or 0. If `cou` is 2, `freq[i]` can be either 0 or any value other than 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `freq` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements, `n` is at least 0, and `i` is 1. If `freq[i]` is 0 or `cou` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` can be either 2 or 1. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `freq[i]`, `n`, `i`, and `cou` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `freq` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements, `n` is at least 0, and `i` is 2. If `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the values of `freq[i]`, `n`, `i`, and `cou` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
