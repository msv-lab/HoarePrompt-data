The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables or the flow of the program outside of the loop it is placed in. Since the provided code snippet consists solely of a `continue` statement without any surrounding loop, the `continue` statement has no effect on the state of the variables or the program flow.

Output State: **`freq` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements, `cou` is 0, `n` must be at least 0, `i` is 0, and `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**
