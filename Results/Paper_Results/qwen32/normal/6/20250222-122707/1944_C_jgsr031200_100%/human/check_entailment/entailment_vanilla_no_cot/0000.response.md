Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a couple of issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Unused Functions**: The code includes several functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) that are not used anywhere in the program. These can be safely removed to clean up the code.

2. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called inside the loop but is not defined before its usage. This will cause a `NameError` at runtime.

3. **Logic Error in `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` is not correct for determining the MEX of the final array `c`. The function does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and instead attempts to determine the MEX based on the frequency of elements in the array `arr`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns. Alice will try to maximize the MEX by picking elements that will help achieve a higher MEX, while Bob will try to minimize it by picking elements that will hinder Alice's goal.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each element
    freq = [0] * n
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
    
    # Determine the MEX based on the frequencies
    mex = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if freq[i] == 0:
            mex = i
            break
        elif freq[i] >= 2:
            mex = i + 1
    
    print(mex)
```

In this corrected version, we count the frequency of each element in the array `arr`. We then determine the MEX by checking the frequency of each element. If an element with a frequency of 0 is found, that is the MEX. If all elements up to `n-1` have a frequency of at least 1, then the MEX is `n`.

This approach is efficient and correctly simulates the game's outcome based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
