Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.
- On Bob's turn, he picks an element from `a` and deletes it from `a`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score of the game is the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.
- Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it.
- We need to find the game's final score if both players play optimally.

### Key Points:
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice will try to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - A frequency array `freq` is created to count occurrences of each number in `arr`.
   - The frequency array is of size `n + 1` because the numbers in `arr` are in the range `[0, n)`.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - The program iterates through the frequency array to find the MEX.
   - It increments a counter `cou` when it finds a number with a frequency of 1.
   - If `cou` reaches 2 or if it encounters a number with a frequency of 0, it prints that number and breaks the loop.

### Correctness of the Program:
- **Frequency Calculation:** The frequency array correctly counts the occurrences of each number in `arr`.
- **MEX Calculation:** The logic to find the MEX is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns. Instead, it simply finds the smallest number with a frequency of 0 or 1, which does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
- **Optimal Play:** The program does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns to maximize or minimize the MEX. It assumes that the MEX can be determined solely based on the frequency of numbers, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the game and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, it does not correctly determine the game's final score.

**Correctness: False**
