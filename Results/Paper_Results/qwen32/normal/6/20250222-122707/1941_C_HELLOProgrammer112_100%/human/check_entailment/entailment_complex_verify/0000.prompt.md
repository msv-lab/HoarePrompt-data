You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

    pppiepieeee

Output

    2
    0
    2
    6
    0
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        z = s.count('mapie')
        print(x + y - z)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) representing the length of the string s, followed by the string s itself, which consists of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        z = s.count('mapie')
        
        print(x + y - z)
        
    #State: The output state after all iterations is the sequence of results for each of the `t` test cases, where each result is the value of `x + y - z` for the corresponding test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it calculates the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string, subtracts the number of occurrences of the substring 'mapie', and prints the result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The current implementation simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and subtracts the occurrences of the overlapping substring "mapie". This approach does not account for the actual characters that need to be removed to eliminate all occurrences of "map" and "pie".

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
11
pppiepieeee
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
To make the string "pppiepieeee" beautiful, we can remove the 'p' at index 3 and the 'i' at index 7, resulting in "pppieeeee", which does not contain "map" or "pie". However, the given program would output 3 because it counts the occurrences of "pie" (3 times) and does not correctly account for the minimum deletions required.

Another example:
Input:
```
1
9
mappppie
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
To make the string "mappppie" beautiful, we can remove the 'm' at index 0 and the 'p' at index 3, resulting in "appppie", which still contains "pie". We need to remove one more 'p' to get "apppiee" and then one more 'i' to get "appppee", which does not contain "map" or "pie". The given program would output 3 because it counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and does not correctly account for the minimum deletions required.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the problem requirements correctly for all potential cases.
