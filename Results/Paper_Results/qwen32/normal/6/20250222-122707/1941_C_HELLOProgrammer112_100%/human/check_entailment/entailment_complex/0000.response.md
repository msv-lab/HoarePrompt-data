### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it "beautiful," which means it should not contain the substrings "pie" or "map." The given program attempts to solve this by counting occurrences of these substrings and adjusting for overlaps.

However, the approach in the program is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Double Counting and Overlaps**: The program counts occurrences of "map" and "pie" separately and then subtracts occurrences of "mapie" to account for overlaps. This approach does not correctly handle all possible overlaps and nested occurrences of the substrings.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The formula `x + y - z` does not accurately reflect the minimum number of deletions required. For example, if a string contains "mapiepie," the program would count two "map" and two "pie" substrings but only subtract one "mapie." This would result in an incorrect count of deletions needed.

3. **Dynamic Programming or Greedy Approach**: A correct solution would likely involve a more sophisticated approach such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to ensure that all necessary deletions are counted without overcounting or undercounting.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
