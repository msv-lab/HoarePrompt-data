Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^4. s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t = input()
    l = t.count('L')
    k = 0
    q1 = 0
    q2 = 0
    if t[-1] == 'L':
        k = a[l - 1] % m
        q1 = l - 2
        q2 = l
    else:
        k = a[l] % m
        q1 = l - 1
        q2 = l + 1
    y = [0] * n
    y[-1] = k
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if t[i] == 'R':
            k = k * a[q2] % m
            q2 += 1
        else:
            k = k * a[q1] % m
            q1 -= 1
        y[i] = k
    print(*y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers from the input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element `y[i]` is the value of `k` after processing the character at index `i` in `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the new input string, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in the new `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element `y[i]` is the value of `k` after the corresponding iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is the final value after the last iteration, `q1` and `q2` are adjusted based on the number of 'R' and non-'R' characters encountered.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is -1, `y` is fully populated with the computed values of `k` for each index from `0` to `n-2`, `k`, `q1`, and `q2` have their final values, and all other variables (`t`, `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `l`) remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
