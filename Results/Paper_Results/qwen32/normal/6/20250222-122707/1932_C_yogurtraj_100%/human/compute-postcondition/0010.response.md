The code snippet `q1 = l - 2` updates the value of `q1` to be `l - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input string that ends with 'L', `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers from the input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in `t`, `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, `q2` is 0.**
