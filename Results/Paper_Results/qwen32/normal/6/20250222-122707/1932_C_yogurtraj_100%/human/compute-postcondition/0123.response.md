The given code snippet is:

```python
q1 -= 1
```

This line of code decrements the value of `q1` by 1. Based on the initial state provided, no other variables are directly affected by this operation. Here is the updated state of the variables:

- The first element of `y` is either `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i] == 'R'`, or `k * a[q1+1] % m` otherwise, and the last element of `y` remains the same as the first element.
- The element at index `n-3` of `y` is `k`.
- `i` is `n-4`.
- `n` remains the same.
- If `t[i] == 'R'`, then `q2` is incremented by 1.
- If `t[i] != 'R'`, then `k` is updated to `k * a[q1+1] % m` and `q1` is decreased by 1.
- `k` is now `k * a[q1] % m`.

Since `q1` is decremented by 1, the new value of `q1` is `q1 - 1`.

Output State: **The first element of `y` is now either `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i] == 'R'`, or `k * a[q1] % m` otherwise, and the last element of `y` remains the same as the first element. The element at index `n-3` of `y` is `k`. `i` is `n-4`. `n` remains the same. If `t[i] == 'R'`, then `q2` is incremented by 1. If `t[i] != 'R'`, then `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decreased by 1. `k` is now `k * a[q1-1] % m`. `q1` is `q1 - 1`.**
