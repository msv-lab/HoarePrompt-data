The code snippet `q1 -= 1` decrements the value of `q1` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `ii` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in the new `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element being `k` and the `i`-th element updated to `k`. If the current character at index `i` in `t` is 'R', `k` is updated to `(k * a[q2]) % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `t[i]` is not 'R', `k` is updated to `k * a[q1 + 1] % m`, `i` is 0; `k` is updated to `(k * a[q1]) % m`. `q1` is decremented by 1.**
