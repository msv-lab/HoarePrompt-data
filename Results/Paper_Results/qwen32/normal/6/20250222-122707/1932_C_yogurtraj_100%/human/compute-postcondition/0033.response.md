Postcondition: **`t` is an input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer from input and must be at least 2, `m` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers from the input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in `t`. If `t[i] == 'R'`, then `q2` is `q2 + 1` and `k` is `(k * a[q2]) % m`. Otherwise, `k` is `(k * a[q1]) % m`, where `q1` is `l - 4` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `q1` is `l - 3`. In both cases, `q1` is `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `q1` is `l - 2`, `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`. `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element being `k` and the first element is `k`, `i` is 0.**
