### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that the functions together achieve the goal of finding the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves inserting the sum of a contiguous subarray anywhere in the array.

#### Key Points:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct according to the problem statement, as the result needs to be output modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is supposed to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within the given array `arr`.
   - It uses a variation of Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and its indices.
   - The function returns a list containing the maximum sum, the starting index, and the ending index of the subarray.
   - The function seems to be working correctly based on the provided states and the expected output.

3. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and `k` (number of operations).
   - It then reads the array `a`.
   - The main program calls `func_2` to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum found is `-1` (which indicates that all elements are negative and the maximum subarray sum is `0`), it sets the maximum sum to `0`.
   - The main program then calculates the final answer using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
     - This formula is based on the idea that the optimal strategy is to repeatedly add the maximum subarray sum to the array.
     - `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k` adds the maximum subarray sum `k` times, where each addition effectively doubles the sum from the previous step.
     - `sum(a)` adds the original sum of the array.
     - `-max_segment[0]` corrects for the initial addition of the maximum subarray sum in the original array sum.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` to output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Analysis:
- The main logic seems correct based on the problem statement and the provided example outputs.
- The use of `2 ** k` to account for the repeated addition of the maximum subarray sum is appropriate.
- The handling of negative numbers and the modulo operation are correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct as it follows the problem statement and the provided logic and examples match the expected output.

**Correctness: True**
