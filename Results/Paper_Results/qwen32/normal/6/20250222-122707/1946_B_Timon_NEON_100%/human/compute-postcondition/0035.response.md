The code snippet `new_segment = [arr[i], i]` updates the `new_segment` variable to be a list containing the current element of `arr` at index `i` and the index `i` itself.

Given the initial state, `new_segment` is either empty or contains `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` was empty; otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated by `arr[i]` if `new_segment` was not empty. Since the code snippet directly assigns `[arr[i], i]` to `new_segment`, it does not depend on the previous state of `new_segment` being empty or not. It will simply overwrite `new_segment` with the new list `[arr[i], i]`.

The other variables (`arr`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`, and `i`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `max_segment` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is either empty or contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
