The code snippet `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` updates the first element of the list `max_segment` by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it. This means that the value of `max_segment[0]` changes, but the other variables remain as they were described in the initial state.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer; `max_segment` is updated such that `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`; `segments_variants` is updated accordingly; `max_sum` remains `-1`; If `arr[i] >= 0`, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1.**
