Postcondition: **`arr` is [1, -2, 3, 5, -1, 2], `new_segment` is [2, 5], `max_segment` is [11, 0], `segments_variants` is a list with at least two segments (e.g., [[1, 0, 0], [3, 4, -1]]), `max_sum` is -1. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]` and the length of `segment` is not 1, then `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment` which is [1, 0, 0]. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.**
