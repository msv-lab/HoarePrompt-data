Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. `max_segment` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]`. `segments_variants` is either empty or contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0. `max_sum` remains `-1`. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]` if `new_segment` was empty; otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated by `arr[i]`. `i` is incremented by 1.**
