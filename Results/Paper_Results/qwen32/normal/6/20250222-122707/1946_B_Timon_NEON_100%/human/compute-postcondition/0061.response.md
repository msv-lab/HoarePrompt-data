The only variable in the loop head is `segment`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `segments_variants` list. If there are more segments in the list, the loop will execute again for the next segment.

At the end of the last iteration, `segment` was the last segment in `segments_variants`. For the loop to execute one more time, `segments_variants` must have at least one more segment. Let's assume the next segment in `segments_variants` is `[3, 4, -1]`.

State: **`arr` is [1, -2, 3, 5, -1, 2], `new_segment` is [2, 5], `max_segment` is [11, 0], `segments_variants` is a list with at least two segments (e.g., [[1, 0, 0], [3, 4, -1]]), `max_sum` is -1, `segment` is [3, 4, -1]**
