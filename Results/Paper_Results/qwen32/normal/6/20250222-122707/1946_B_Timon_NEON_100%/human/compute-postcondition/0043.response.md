Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` includes a new segment which is `max_segment` followed by `[i - 1]`, and `new_segment` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`, `segments_variants` includes the new segment `new_segment + [i - 1]`, and `new_segment` is updated accordingly. In both cases, `max_sum` remains `-1` and `i` is incremented by 1.**
