The code snippet assigns the value of `segment` to `total_max_segment`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `segment`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `total_max_segment`. However, we know that `total_max_segment` will now hold whatever value `segment` held.

Output State: **`arr` is [1, -2, 3, 5, -1, 2], `new_segment` is [2, 5], `max_segment` is [11, 0], `segments_variants` is a list with at least one segment (e.g., [[1, 0, 0]]), `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is `segment`.**
