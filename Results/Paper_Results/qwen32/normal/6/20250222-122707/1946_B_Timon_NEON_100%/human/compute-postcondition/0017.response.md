The code snippet `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` modifies the first element of the `new_segment` list by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it. This affects only `new_segment[0]`, and no other variables are changed. 

Given that `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, the value of `new_segment[0]` will increase by at least 0.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `new_segment` is a non-empty list where `new_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is `-1`, and `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**
