Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is updated accordingly, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `new_segment` is updated accordingly, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `max_segment[0]` has been increased by the value of `arr[i]`. The values of `arr`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`, `new_segment`, and `i` are updated as per the initial state description.
