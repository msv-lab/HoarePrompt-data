Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. `max_segment` is updated such that `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`. `segments_variants` is updated accordingly. `max_sum` remains `-1`. If `arr[i] >= 0`, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1.**
