Output State: **`arr` is [1, -2, 3, 5, -1, 2], `new_segment` is [2, 5], `max_segment` is [11, 0], `segments_variants` is a list with at least two segments (e.g., [[1, 0, 0], [3, 4, -1]]), `max_sum` is -1, `segment` is [1, 0, 0], `total_max_segment` is [1, 0, 0]**.

Explanation: The variable `total_max_segment` is assigned the value of `segment`, which is `[1, 0, 0]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
