Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly k operations as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is a correct utility function, but it is not used anywhere in the provided code.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to find the maximum sum contiguous subarray in the array `arr` and return it along with its start and end indices.
   - The logic seems to be a variation of Kadane's algorithm but it is not correctly implemented for the problem at hand. The function does not handle cases where all the elements are negative correctly. Also, it does not handle the edge cases properly, such as when the array is empty or has only one element.
   - The function also has some logical errors in the way it handles negative numbers and resetting the `new_segment` and `max_segment`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after performing exactly k operations, but it is incomplete and does not contain any logic to perform the operations or calculate the sum.

The provided code does not contain any logic to perform the operations described in the problem statement. It does not insert the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array and does not perform the operations `k` times. The code also does not handle the modulo operation correctly for the final sum.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 3
  2 2 8
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  96
  ```
- Actual Output:
  - The provided code does not produce any output because it is incomplete.

Given the above issues, the code is not correct and does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
