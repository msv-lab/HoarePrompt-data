The code appends `new_segment + [i - 1]` to `segments_variants`. Given that `new_segment` is a list containing an integer and an index, and `i` is an integer, the updated `segments_variants` will include this new segment.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `max_segment` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` was empty; otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated by `arr[i]` if `new_segment` was not empty, `i` is incremented by 1**.

In simpler terms, `segments_variants` now includes the new segment formed by `new_segment` with the index `i - 1` appended to it. All other variables remain as described in the initial state, except for `segments_variants` which has been updated.
