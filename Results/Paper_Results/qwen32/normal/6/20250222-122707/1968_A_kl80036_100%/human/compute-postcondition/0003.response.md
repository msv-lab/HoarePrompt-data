Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is defined as `x - 1`.

We are asked to determine the output of the `print(y)` statement.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The variable `x` is an input integer, meaning its value is not explicitly provided but is known to be an integer.
2. The variable `y` is calculated as `x - 1`. Therefore, `y` will be one less than the value of `x`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `y`. However, we can describe `y` in terms of `x`.

Output: **y (where y is x - 1)**
