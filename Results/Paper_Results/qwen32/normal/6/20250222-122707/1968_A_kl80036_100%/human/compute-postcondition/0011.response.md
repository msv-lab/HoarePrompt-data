Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `i` is 2 (though `i` is not used in the print statement).
- `x` is an input integer (its exact value is not provided).
- `y` is defined as `x - 1`.

The `print(y)` statement will output the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`. Since we do not have the exact value of `x`, we can only express the output in terms of `x`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `x` minus 1.

Output: **x - 1 (where x is the input integer)**
