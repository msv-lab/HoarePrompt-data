The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the input integer provided to the `range` function. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

The input integer to the `range` function is not a variable that we can adjust directly in the state, but we can infer that it must be greater than the current value of `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x - 1`**
