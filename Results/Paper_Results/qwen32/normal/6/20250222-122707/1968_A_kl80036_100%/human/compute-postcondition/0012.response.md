To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `i`, `x`, and `y` change throughout the loop's execution.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t`: The number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
   - For each test case, we have an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000).

2. **Loop Code:**
   ```python
   for i in range(int(input())):
       x = int(input())
       y = x - 1
       print(y)
   ```
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - In each iteration:
     - `x` is read from the input.
     - `y` is calculated as `x - 1`.
     - `y` is printed.

3. **Output State after the first 3 iterations:**
   - For each iteration, `i` increments from 0 to `t-1`.
   - `x` is an input integer for each iteration.
   - `y` is `x - 1` for each iteration.

4. **Final Output State:**
   - After all `t` iterations, `i` will have taken on all values from 0 to `t-1`.
   - Each `x` will be an input integer for each iteration.
   - Each `y` will be `x - 1` for each iteration, and each `y` will have been printed.

### Conclusion:
After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, there is no specific final state for `i`, `x`, and `y` because `i` will have completed its range from 0 to `t-1`, and `x` and `y` will have been re-assigned in each iteration based on the input values.

However, the output state of the program can be described as the collection of all printed `y` values, one for each test case.

### Output State:
Output State: **The program will have printed `y` (which is `x - 1` for each input `x`) for each of the `t` test cases.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is that the program will have printed `t` lines, each containing the value of `x - 1` for the corresponding input `x`.
