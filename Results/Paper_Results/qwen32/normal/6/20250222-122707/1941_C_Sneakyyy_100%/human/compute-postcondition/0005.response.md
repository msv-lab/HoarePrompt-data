To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `i < len(a) - 2`.

The variables involved in this condition are `i` and `len(a)`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variable `i`**: Right before the loop, `i` is 0. This is a valid starting point for the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

2. **Variable `len(a)`**: The length of the string `a` is critical. The loop condition `i < len(a) - 2` means that the loop will execute if `len(a) - 2` is greater than 0, which implies that `len(a)` must be at least 3.

Given that `a` is a string entered by the user, we need to ensure that the length of `a` is at least 3 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the length of `a` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string entered by the user with length at least 3, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0**
