Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with length greater than 5, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `i` is either 4 or 6, `ans` is either 1 or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so if `ans` was initially 0, it is now 1, and if `ans` was initially 1, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
