Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an input integer, a is a string entered by the user, i is the final index such that i < len(a) - 2 after the loop terminates for all test cases, ans is the total number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in non-overlapping segments of length 3 within the string a for all test cases.**

In simpler terms, after all the loop iterations have finished, `t` remains the same as the initial input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is the length of the string `a`, and `ans` accumulates the total count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`. The variable `i` will be the final index that was checked in the last iteration of the inner while loop for each test case.
