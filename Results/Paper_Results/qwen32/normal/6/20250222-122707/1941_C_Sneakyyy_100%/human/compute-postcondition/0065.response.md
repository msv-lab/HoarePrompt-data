The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with length greater than 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `s` is the first three characters of `a`, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'**.
