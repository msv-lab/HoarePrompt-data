The value of `i` is incremented by 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, and `s`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with length greater than 2, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0, `s` is the first three characters of `a`, and `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'.**
