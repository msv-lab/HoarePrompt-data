The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` updates the value of `s` to be a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at `i + 3`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a string with length greater than 5.
- `s` is the first three characters of `a`.
- If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `ans` is 0.

The value of `s` changes based on the value of `i`:
- If `i` is 3, then `s` becomes the substring of `a` starting from index 3 to 6.
- If `i` is 1, then `s` becomes the substring of `a` starting from index 1 to 4.

Since `i` is either 1 or 3, the new value of `s` will be the substring of `a` starting from `i` to `i + 3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with length greater than 5, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `i` is either 1 or 3, `ans` is either 0 or 1.**
