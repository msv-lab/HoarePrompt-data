The value of `i` is incremented by 3, so `i` changes from 2 to 5. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with length greater than 5, `i` is 5, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `s` is the substring of `a` from index 2 to 5**.
