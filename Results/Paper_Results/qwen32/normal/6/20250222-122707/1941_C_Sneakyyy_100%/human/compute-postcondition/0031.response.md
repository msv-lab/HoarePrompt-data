The code snippet `i = 0` sets the variable `i` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `ans`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer value from user input, `a` is the string entered by the user, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0**.
