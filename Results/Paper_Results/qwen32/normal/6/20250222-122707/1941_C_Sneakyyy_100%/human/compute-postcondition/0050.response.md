Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer value from user input, `a` is a list of integers with at least 6 characters, `s` is `a[4:7]` if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `s` is `a[2:5]`, `i` is 4 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 2, `ans` is 2 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0.
```
i += 1
```

The value of `i` is incremented by 1. If the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', `i` was 4 and is now 5. Otherwise, `i` was 2 and is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer value from user input, `a` is a list of integers with at least 6 characters, `s` is `a[4:7]` if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `s` is `a[2:5]`, `i` is 5 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 3, `ans` is 2 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0.**
