Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer value from user input, `a` is a list of integers with at least 6 characters, `s` is `a[3:6]` if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `s` is `a[1:4]`, `i` is 6 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 4, `ans` is 2 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1.**

Natural language description: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. If the initial value of `s` was 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is now 2; otherwise, `ans` is now 1.
