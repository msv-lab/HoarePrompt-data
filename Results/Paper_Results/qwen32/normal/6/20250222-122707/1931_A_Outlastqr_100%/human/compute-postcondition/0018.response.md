The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the input to `range`, which is `int(input())`. Since the loop iterates based on the value of `i` and the range specified by the input, we need to adjust these variables for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some integer value. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

The input to `range` does not change within the loop; it is determined by the input value provided at the start of the loop execution. Therefore, we do not need to adjust the input to `range`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is `i + 1`**.
