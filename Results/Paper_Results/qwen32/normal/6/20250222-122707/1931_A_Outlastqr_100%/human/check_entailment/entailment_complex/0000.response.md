### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify if the logic used in the program correctly identifies the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters for each given encoded value `n`.

The provided program uses the following logic:
1. For `n > 52`, it sets the first letter to `alphabet[n - 53]` and the last two letters to `'zz'`.
2. For `n == 27`, it sets the word to `'aay'`.
3. For `28 <= n <= 52`, it sets the first letter to `'a'`, the second letter to `alphabet[n - 28]`, and the third letter to `'z'`.
4. For `n <= 26`, it sets the first two letters to `'aa'` and the third letter to `alphabet[n - 3]`.

Let's analyze the logic for correctness:
- **Case 1: `n > 52`**
  - The sum of positions of the letters in the word `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` is `n`.
  - `alphabet[n - 53]` is a letter between 'c' and 'z' (since `n - 53` ranges from 0 to 22, which corresponds to 'a' to 'w' in the alphabet, but the word starts from 'c' as the smallest possible letter here).
  - `'zz'` adds 52 to the sum.
  - Therefore, the total sum is `(n - 53) + 26 + 26 = n`.
  - This word is lexicographically smallest for `n > 52` because the first letter is minimized and the last two letters are fixed as 'z'.

- **Case 2: `n == 27`**
  - The word `'aay'` has a sum of positions 1 + 1 + 25 = 27.
  - This is the smallest possible word for `n == 27`.

- **Case 3: `28 <= n <= 52`**
  - The word `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` has a sum of positions 1 + (n - 28 + 1) + 26 = n.
  - The first letter is fixed as 'a', the second letter ranges from 'a' to 'y', and the third letter is fixed as 'z'.
  - This word is lexicographically smallest for `28 <= n <= 52` because the first letter is minimized and the third letter is fixed as 'z'.

- **Case 4: `n <= 26`**
  - The word `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` has a sum of positions 1 + 1 + (n - 3 + 1) = n.
  - The first two letters are fixed as 'a', and the third letter ranges from 'a' to 'x'.
  - This word is lexicographically smallest for `n <= 26` because the first two letters are minimized.

Each case ensures that the word is lexicographically smallest and matches the sum `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
