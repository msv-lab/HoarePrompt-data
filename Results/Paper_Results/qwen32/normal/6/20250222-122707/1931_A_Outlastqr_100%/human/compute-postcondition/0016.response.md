Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `n` > 52, `word` is the character at index `n - 53` of `alphabet` followed by 'zz'. If `n` is greater than 27 but less than or equal to 52, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. Otherwise, if `n` is less than or equal to 27, `word` is the string 'aa' + the character at index `n - 3` in `alphabet`.**
