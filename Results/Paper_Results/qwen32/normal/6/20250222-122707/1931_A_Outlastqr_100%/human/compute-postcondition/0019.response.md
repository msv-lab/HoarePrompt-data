The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to `n` based on the integer input provided by the user. The variables `t`, `alphabet`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. Since `i` is described as `i + 1`, it implies that `i` has already been incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed. Therefore, `i` remains as `i + 1` after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is `i + 1`**.
