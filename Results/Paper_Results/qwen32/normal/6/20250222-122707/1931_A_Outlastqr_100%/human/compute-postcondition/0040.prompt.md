Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    word = ''
    if n > 52:
        word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
    elif n > 27:
        word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
    elif n == 27:
        word = 'aay'
    else:
        word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
    print(word)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `n` > 52, `word` is the character at index `n - 53` of `alphabet` followed by 'zz'. If `n` is greater than 27 but less than or equal to 52, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. Otherwise, if `n` is less than or equal to 27, `word` is the string 'aa' + the character at index `n - 3` in `alphabet`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is `i + 1`, and `word` is determined based on the value of `n`. If `n` > 52, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If `n` > 27 and `n` <= 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` equals 27, `word` is `'aay'`. Otherwise, if `n` <= 27, `word` is `'aa'` concatenated with the character at index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is `i + 2`. If `n` > 52, `word` is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. If `n` is 27, `word` is `'aay'`. If 28 <= `n` <= 52, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
