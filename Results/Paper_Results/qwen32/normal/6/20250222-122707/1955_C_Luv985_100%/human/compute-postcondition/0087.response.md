Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is at least 1 minus `mi * 2`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`; `l` is 0 and `a[l]` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 1; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` before the decrement; `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k` before the decrement.**

The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
