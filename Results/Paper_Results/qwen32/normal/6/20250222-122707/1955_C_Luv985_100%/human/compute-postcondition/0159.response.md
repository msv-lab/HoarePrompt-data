Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by `mi * 2`; `a` is a list of integers from the input where `a[0]` has been decreased by `mi` and `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `mi`; `r` is `n - 1`; `mi` is the minimum of the original `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. Additionally, `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`. The current value of `a[r]` is 0, so `l` is 1, `a[l]` is some integer value, and `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `ans` remains 0.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged as described in the initial state.
