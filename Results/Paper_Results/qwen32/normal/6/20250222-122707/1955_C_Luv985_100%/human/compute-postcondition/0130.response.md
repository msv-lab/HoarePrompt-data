Postcondition: **`t` is `k % 2`; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is at least 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` has been updated to `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` has been updated to `a[r] - mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged; `l` is 1 (if `l` was 0 before) or 2 (if `l` was 1 before) or 0 (if `a[l]` was not 0) if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `l` remains 0 or 1; `r` is `n - 1` (adjusted to ensure `l < r`); `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` after the modification; if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
