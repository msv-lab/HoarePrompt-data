The code `a = input().split()` takes an input string, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. Given the initial state, `a` was a list of `n` integers, but after this operation, `a` becomes a list of strings, each representing an integer that was input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` strings, each representing an integer between 1 and 10^9.**
