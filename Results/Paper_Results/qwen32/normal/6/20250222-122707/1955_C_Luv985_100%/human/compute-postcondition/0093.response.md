Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is at least 1 minus `mi * 2`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` before the decrement; `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k` before the decrement. If `a[r]` (which is `a[n-1]`) is 0, then `r` is `n - 2`, `a[n-1]` is 0, `l` is 1, `a[l]` is the original `a[1]` value, and `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `r` is `n - 1`, `l` remains 0, and `ans` remains 0.**
