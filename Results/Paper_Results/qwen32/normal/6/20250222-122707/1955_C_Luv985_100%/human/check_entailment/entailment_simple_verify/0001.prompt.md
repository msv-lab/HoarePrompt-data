You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
The task is to determine how many ships are sunk after `k` attacks by the Kraken. The Kraken alternates attacks between the first and last ship, reducing their durability by 1 each time. If a ship's durability reaches 0, it sinks and is no longer attacked.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
    - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
    - It then reads the list of durabilities `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
    - `l` and `r` are initialized to point to the first and last ship, respectively.
    - `ans` is initialized to count the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Loop:**
    - The loop continues as long as there are ships left (`l < r`) and attacks remaining (`k > 0`).
    - It calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ship (`mi = min(a[l], a[r])`).
    - If the Kraken can fully reduce both ships' durability by `mi` within the remaining attacks (`mi * 2 <= k`):
        - It reduces the durability of both ships by `mi`.
        - It subtracts `mi * 2` from the remaining attacks.
        - If a ship's durability reaches 0, it increments the sunk ship count (`ans`) and moves the pointer to the next ship.
    - If the Kraken cannot fully reduce both ships' durability by `mi` within the remaining attacks:
        - It calculates the remaining attacks (`t = k % 2`).
        - It checks if the first ship's durability will reach 0 after the remaining attacks. If so, it increments the sunk ship count.
        - It breaks out of the loop.

4. **Single Ship Case:**
    - If there is only one ship left (`l == r`), it checks if the remaining attacks are enough to sink it (`k >= a[l]`).

5. **Output:**
    - It prints the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Issues and Corrections
- The program's logic for handling the case when `l == r` is correct.
- However, the handling of the case when `mi * 2 > k` is flawed. The program should continue to attack the ships until `k` is exhausted or all ships are sunk.
- The program should not break out of the loop prematurely when `mi * 2 > k`. Instead, it should handle the remaining attacks on the first and last ships accordingly.

### Correctness
The given program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the Kraken cannot fully reduce both ships' durability in one go and there are still attacks remaining. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
