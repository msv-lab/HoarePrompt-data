Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 minus `mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers from the input with `a[0]` decreased by `mi` and `a[n-1]` decreased by `mi`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `ans` is 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `ans` remains 1, 2, or 3. `r` is `n-1` and `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so if `ans` was originally 0, 1, or 2, it is now 1, 2, or 3 respectively. If `ans` was originally 1, 2, or 3 (based on the condition `a[l]` being 0 or not), it is now 2, 3, or 4 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
