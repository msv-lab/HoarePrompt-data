Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is at least 1 and has been decremented by `2 * mi`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` has been updated to `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` has been updated to `a[r] - mi`; `l` is 0 or 1; `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` after the modification; `ans` is 1, 2, or 3.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
