The code snippet `k -= mi * 2` decrements the value of `k` by twice the value of `mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 and `k > 0` minus `mi * 2`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is now `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`; `l` and `r` are integers such that `l < r`; `ans` is an integer; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**
