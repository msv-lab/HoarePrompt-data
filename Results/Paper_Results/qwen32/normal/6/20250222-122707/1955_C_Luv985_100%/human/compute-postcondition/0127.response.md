Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is at least 1 and has been decremented by `mi * 2`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[r]` has been updated to `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` was 0, `r` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by 1 if `mi * 2 <= k` or if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` after the modification. If `a[r]` was not 0, `r` is decremented by 1. If `mi * 2 > k` and `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
