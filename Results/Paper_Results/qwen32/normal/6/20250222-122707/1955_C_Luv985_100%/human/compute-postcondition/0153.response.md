Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by `mi * 2`; `a` is a list of integers from the input where `a[0]` has been decreased by `mi` and `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `mi`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0; `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. Additionally, `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been decreased by `mi * 2`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
