Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-2 or n-1 integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `a` and `b` are the first and last elements of `nums` respectively, and `x` is min(a, b). `b` is greater than 0. If `a` is greater than 0, `nums` has n-1 integers with the first element being `a` and the rest being the original `nums` elements. If `k` >= 2 * x, then `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`. If `a` is 0, `nums` has n-2 integers and `ans` is set to 1. If `k` < 2 * x, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
