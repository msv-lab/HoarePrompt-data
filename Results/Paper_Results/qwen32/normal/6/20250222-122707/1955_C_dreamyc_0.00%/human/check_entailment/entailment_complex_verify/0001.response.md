### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships based on the given problem description. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness using the annotated version of the code and the original assessment.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - It then reads the list of durabilities `nums`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The `func_1` function processes each test case.
   - `nums` is converted to a `deque` for efficient popping from both ends.
   - `ans` initializes the count of ships that have sunk.

3. **Kraken Attacks Simulation:**
   - The `while` loop continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and at least two ships (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - Inside the loop, the first and last elements (`a` and `b`) are popped from the deque.
   - `x` is set to the minimum of `a` and `b`, representing the number of attacks that can fully damage both ships.
   - If `k >= 2 * x`, both ships' durabilities are reduced by `x`, and `k` is decreased by `2 * x`.
   - If `k < 2 * x`, the loop breaks as there aren't enough attacks to fully damage both ships.
   - After the attack, if a ship's durability is greater than 0, it is appended back to the deque; otherwise, `ans` is incremented.

4. **Handling the Last Ship:**
   - After the loop, if there is one ship left and `k` is still greater than or equal to its durability, that ship is also sunk, and `ans` is incremented.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the number of ships that have sunk.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attack pattern by alternating between the first and last ships.
- It efficiently handles the decrement of durability and the removal of ships that have sunk.
- The use of a `deque` allows for efficient popping from both ends, which is crucial given the constraints.
- The logic for handling the last ship when there is only one ship left is correct.

### Verification with Annotated Code:
- The annotations confirm that the state of the program is correctly tracked at key points.
- The annotations describe the state of `k`, `nums`, and `ans` accurately throughout the execution.
- The final check for a single remaining ship is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken based on the given problem description and constraints. The annotations and the original assessment both support the correctness of the program.

**Final: True**
