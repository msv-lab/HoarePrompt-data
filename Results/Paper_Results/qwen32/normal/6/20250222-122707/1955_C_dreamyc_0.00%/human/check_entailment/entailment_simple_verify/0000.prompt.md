You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not account for the scenario where the Kraken has enough attacks to sink all the ships, but the code may not correctly handle the remaining attacks after the ships have been sunk.

Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
5 100
1 1 1 1 1
```
In this case, the Kraken has 100 attacks and there are 5 ships, each with a durability of 1. The Kraken should sink all 5 ships in the first 10 attacks (2 attacks per ship).

However, the code provided will only sink the ships until the deque has fewer than 2 ships left. After sinking the first 4 ships, the deque will have only 1 ship left. At this point, the code will break out of the while loop because `len(nums) < 2`, and it will not account for the remaining 90 attacks.

Here’s the step-by-step breakdown of the issue:
1. The Kraken attacks the first ship (durability 1) -> ship sinks, 4 ships left.
2. The Kraken attacks the last ship (durability 1) -> ship sinks, 3 ships left.
3. The Kraken attacks the first ship (durability 1) -> ship sinks, 2 ships left.
4. The Kraken attacks the last ship (durability 1) -> ship sinks, 1 ship left.
5. The Kraken attacks the first ship (durability 1) -> ship sinks, 0 ships left.
6. The Kraken has 95 attacks left, but the code will not account for these because the deque is empty.

The correct code should continue to handle the remaining attacks even if there is only one ship left. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = 0
    nums = deque(nums)
    
    while k and nums:
        if len(nums) >= 2:
            (a, b) = (nums.popleft(), nums.pop())
            x = min(a, b)
            if k >= 2 * x:
                k -= 2 * x
            else:
                x = k // 2
                a -= x
                b -= x
                k = 0
            if a > 0:
                nums.appendleft(a)
            else:
                ans += 1
            if b > 0:
                nums.append(b)
            else:
                ans += 1
        else:
            # Only one ship left
            x = nums[0]
            if k >= x:
                k -= x
                ans += 1
                nums.pop()
            else:
                nums[0] -= k
                k = 0
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected code ensures that the Kraken's remaining attacks are properly accounted for, even when there is only one ship left.
