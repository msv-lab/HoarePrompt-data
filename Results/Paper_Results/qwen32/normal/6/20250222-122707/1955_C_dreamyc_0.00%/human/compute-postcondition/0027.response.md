The value of `k` is decreased by `2 * x`. The values of `n`, `nums`, `ans`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0 minus 2 * `x`, `nums` is a deque with at least 2 integers, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` is `a - x`, `b` is `b - min(a, b)`, and `x` is `min(a, b)`**.
