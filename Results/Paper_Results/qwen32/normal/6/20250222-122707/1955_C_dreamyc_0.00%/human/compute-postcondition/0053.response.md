Postcondition: **`k` is the remaining value after all possible reductions, `nums` has 0, 1, or more elements, and `ans` is the count of elements that were completely reduced to 0. It is not the case that `k` is non-zero, `nums` has exactly one element, and `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`.**
