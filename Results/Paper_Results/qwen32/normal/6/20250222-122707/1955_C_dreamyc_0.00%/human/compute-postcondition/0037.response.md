Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with at least `n-2` integers, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is the new first element of the deque before the operation, `b` is the new last element of the deque before the operation, and `x` is `min(a, b)`**

Explanation: The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the first and last elements of the deque `nums`, respectively, using `nums.popleft()` and `nums.pop()`. The deque `nums` now has two fewer elements. The values of `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `x` remain unchanged.
