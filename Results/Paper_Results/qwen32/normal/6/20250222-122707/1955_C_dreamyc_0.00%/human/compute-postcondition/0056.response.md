Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It reduces pairs of elements from `nums` by the minimum of the pair, using up to `k` units of reduction. It returns the count of elements that are completely reduced to 0. If there is exactly one element left in `nums` and `k` is sufficient to reduce it to 0, it returns the count plus one.**
