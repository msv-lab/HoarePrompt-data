Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of durabilities `nums`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The `func_1` function handles the logic for each test case.
   - The list `nums` is converted to a `deque` for efficient popping from both ends.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to count the number of ships that have sunk.

3. **Kraken Attacks Simulation:**
   - The program uses a `while` loop to simulate the Kraken's attacks, which continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - Inside the loop, the program pops the first and last elements from the deque (`a` and `b`), representing the first and last ships.
   - The variable `x` is set to the minimum of `a` and `b`, representing the maximum number of attacks that can be fully absorbed by both ships.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, the ships' durabilities are reduced by `x`, and `k` is decreased by `2 * x`.
   - If `k` is less than `2 * x`, the loop breaks as the Kraken cannot fully attack both ships.
   - After the attack, if a ship's durability is greater than 0, it is appended back to the deque; otherwise, the `ans` counter is incremented.

4. **Handling the Last Ship:**
   - After the loop, if there is one ship left and `k` is still greater than or equal to its durability, that ship is also sunk, and `ans` is incremented.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the number of ships that have sunk.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attack pattern by alternating between the first and last ships.
- It efficiently handles the decrement of durability and the removal of ships that have sunk.
- The use of a `deque` allows for efficient popping from both ends, which is crucial given the constraints.
- The logic for handling the last ship when there is only one ship left is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken based on the given problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
