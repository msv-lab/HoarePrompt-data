#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:

        if b > 0:

    #State: `k` is the remaining value after all possible reductions, `nums` has 0, 1, or more elements, and `ans` is the count of elements that were completely reduced to 0.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns ans + 1, where ans is the count of elements that were completely reduced to 0, and since nums has exactly 1 element, the returned value is directly ans + 1.
    #State: `k` is the remaining value after all possible reductions, `nums` has 0, 1, or more elements, and `ans` is the count of elements that were completely reduced to 0. It is not the case that `k` is non-zero, `nums` has exactly one element, and `k` is greater than or equal to the single element in `nums`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the count of elements that were completely reduced to 0, which is 'ans'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It reduces pairs of elements from `nums` by the minimum of the pair, using up to `k` units of reduction. It returns the count of elements that are completely reduced to 0. If there is exactly one element left in `nums` and `k` is sufficient to reduce it to 0, it returns the count plus one.
