The code snippet `b -= x` modifies the value of `b` by subtracting `x` from it. Given that `x` is defined as `min(a, b)`, the new value of `b` will be `b - min(a, b)`. This means that `b` will either be reduced by its own value (if `b <= a`), making it 0, or it will be reduced by `a` (if `a < b`).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with at least 2 integers (excluding the first and last elements that were `a` and `b`), `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` is `a - x`, `b` is `b - min(a, b)`, and `x` is `min(a, b)`**.
