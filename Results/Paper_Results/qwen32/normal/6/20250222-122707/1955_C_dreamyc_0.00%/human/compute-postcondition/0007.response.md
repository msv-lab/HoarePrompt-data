Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-2 integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element that was in `nums` minus `x`, `b` is the last element that was in `nums` minus `x`, `x` is min(a, b)`**

Explanation: The value of `b` is updated to be `b - x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
