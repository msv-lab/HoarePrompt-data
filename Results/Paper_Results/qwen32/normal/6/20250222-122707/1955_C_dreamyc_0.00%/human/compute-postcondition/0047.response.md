The code snippet `nums.append(b)` adds the value of `b` to the end of the deque `nums`. This operation modifies the deque `nums` by appending `b` to it, but it does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `ans`, `a`, or `b` themselves.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with `b` appended to the end, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 if `a > 0`; otherwise, `ans` is either 1, 2, or 3, `a` is the new first element of the deque, `b` is the new last element of the deque. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `k` is reduced by `2 * x`, `a` is reduced by `x`, and `b` is reduced by `x`. Otherwise, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `x` is `min(a, b)` in both cases.**

In simple terms, the deque `nums` now includes `b` as its last element, while all other variables retain their previous values.
