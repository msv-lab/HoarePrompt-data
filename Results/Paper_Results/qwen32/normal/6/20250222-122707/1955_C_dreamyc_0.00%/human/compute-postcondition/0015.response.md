Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-2 integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `ans` is 1, `a` and `b` are the first and last elements of `nums` respectively, and `x` is min(a, b). Additionally, `a` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
