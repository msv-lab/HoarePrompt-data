### Reasoning:
The provided program simulates the Kraken's attacks on the ships in the manner described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `T`. For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`, followed by the list of durabilities `nums`.

2. **Simulation of Attacks**:
   - It uses a `deque` to efficiently pop elements from both ends.
   - It iteratively attacks the first and last ship in the list, reducing their durability by the minimum of their current durabilities or until `k` attacks are exhausted.
   - If a ship's durability drops to 0, it is considered sunk and is removed from the deque. The count of sunk ships is incremented (`ans`).
   - The process continues until there are either fewer than 2 ships left or `k` attacks are exhausted.

3. **Final Check**:
   - If there is exactly one ship left and `k` is still greater than or equal to its durability, that ship is also sunk.
   - The program returns the total count of sunk ships.

### Correctness:
The program correctly simulates the process described in the problem statement and calculates the number of ships sunk after the Kraken's attacks. The use of a `deque` allows efficient operations on both ends of the list, which is crucial given the constraints.

The logic for handling the attacks and counting the sunk ships is accurate. The final check for the last remaining ship also ensures that the program accounts for all possible attacks.

Therefore, based on the provided implementation and the logic used, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
